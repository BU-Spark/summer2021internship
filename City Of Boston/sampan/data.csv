20210625,MBTA announces newest addition to the “Better Bus Project”,"On June 8, MBTA announced the Bus Network Redesign plan (BNR) under its “Better Bus Project” to improve the bus service system. The plan marks MBTA’s effort in providing better access to jobs, education, and essential services for the residents of transit-critical communities, such as Roxbury, Everett, Chelsea, Mattapan, and Lynn. As a part of MBTA’s $8-billion, 5-year systemwide capital investment program since 2018, it now claims to deliver a more equitable future of transportation by ameliorating many travel inconveniences experienced by riders during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Promoted as the “once-in-a-generation redesign,” the BNR strives to rearrange individual routes to focus service into core areas, connect more riders to rapid transit, and make trips more direct. In the last decade, the Boston population marks a 7% increase from 2012 to 2017. Households owning vehicles marks a 15% increase from 2012 to 2017, and the average trip during peak hours took 20% longer in 2019 than it did in 2006. 
As Boston reopens, BNR strives to be a re-imagining of the transit system that will better reflect the region’s travel needs and create a more pleasant experience for current and future bus riders. 
However, the Director of Housing and Community Development in Chelsea Alex Train expressed some concerns. “We feel that those goals are often in conflict with our [stance on] environmental justice and equity. In particular, we’re seeking to prioritize and preserve service on key bus routes, such as route 112. They provide the only public transit service from the soldier’s home, home to low-income seniors who depend on certain routes for running errands, going into the grocery store, and visiting the doctor.”
Train maintained that the MBTA system requires a more comprehensive assessment, as the Authority could restructure certain routes to improve service for riders. There are also concerns on other routes, some of which are not necessarily the most heavily used bus routes.”
In response to these concerns, the MBTA Community Liaison Terrie Chan told Sampan that the MBTA is currently in partnership with the Office of System-Wide Accessibility, Mass Senior Action Council, and other local community-based organizations to plan for targeted outreach to seniors and people with disabilities. 
“We are looking into all trips in the region, including non-work trips and those that are not taken by MBTA service. For this reason, we are not solely focused on congested corridors but areas with high travel demand instead. The data we are using has shown, for example, that there is a lot of travel between downtown Chelsea and downtown Everett that the MBTA does not currently serve well. We also know the data will not show everything — which is why we are planning for extensive community outreach so that the people who know these neighborhoods the best have the opportunity to provide their input. All of this together will shape what the future of MBTA bus service looks like,” Chan said.
In spring and summer of 2021, MBTA will work toward its proposal for a new network. And they will continue to talk to riders and stakeholders about the project. In the fall and winter of 2021-22, MBTA will share its proposal for a new network and gather extensive public feedback on it. MBTA will incorporate feedback into a final network map for Board approval in early 2022. The implementation will begin from 2022-2026.

20210521,International graduates navigate job search challenges in the U.S.,"Standing in the Boston Common his freshman year in 2016, Jay Liu wears his Emerson College T-shirt proudly as he smiles for the camera (Photo courtesy of Jay Liu).
By Jocelyn Yang and Tivara Tanudjaja
(請點這裡閱讀中文版。) 
When Jay Liu graduated with a Bachelor of Arts from Emerson College in December 2020, he hoped he would be working as a film editor soon. 
But months went by as he sat in his Boston apartment holding his resume, portfolio and work authorization documents, trying to piece together his American dream.
After spending three years in Boston, the Chinese international student planned to attend the Emerson Los Angeles program his senior year in spring 2020. He searched for an L.A. apartment and reached out to the Emerson alumni for networking opportunities. He was ready to move across the country to work at a post-production studio, doing a range of tasks cutting and assembling raw footage for films. 
But the staggeringly high coronavirus infection rates in California resulted in another lockdown during the summer of 2020, halting Liu’s journey to the West Coast. 
Anxious about his prospects of getting a job in Boston, away from Hollywood, Liu began searching for film-related opportunities. He landed a job offer at a Boston film company in December and was supposed to receive his Employment Authorization Document (EAD) by the following January, allowing him to work that same month. But the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) delayed Optional Practical Training application processes due to the pandemic, forcing applicants like Liu to wait.
Having lost his job offer, Liu is now back at square one. With just just a month left on his 90-day limit, Liu is feeling the pressure to get a job soon. But the days pass as he sits on his computer scrolling through the limited film job opportunities offered in the city. Some days he feels hopeful, and others he doesn’t see an end to his job searching.
As an international student, Liu can stay up to a year under OPT, but he has until May 24 to get an OPT-qualifying job. Otherwise, he must go back. His dream of working in Hollywood is slowly coming to a close.
Besides the paperwork process, COVID-19 has also made the situation even more difficult. Many companies stopped job hirings during the beginning of the pandemic, and are only just beginning to start back up. The class of 2020 international graduates who wished to stay for OPT have faced unprecedented challenges in job hunting and financial and emotional wellbeing. 
“I came here because American schools can provide resources, techniques, and skills I want to gain, as well as once the friendly policy for foreign students and workers,” Liu said in a Zoom interview. “But it’s a different time now.” 
Inspired by the 2004 crime drama film “Crash,” he said he hoped his film editing work would eventually amplify voices of minority communities. 
Born and raised in the Liaoning province of northeastern China, Liu grew a passion for film when he attended an international high school in Singapore. Since then, he knew he would come to the United States to pursue his dreams. 
Liu got accepted into Emerson College’s Visual and Media Arts program in 2016. He applied for an F-1 visa, allowing him to move and study in the United States.
As an international student, Liu has the opportunity to stay in the country for an additional year through a temporary employment program called OPT. Through it, international students receive an EAD, which allows them to legally work and earn money in the United States.
With a limited time offered to work in the country post-graduation, international students are at a disadvantage because their non-citizen status requires additional paperwork and USCIS work authorization. 
Liu says paperwork delays are not the only challenges he faced. Most jobs in the film industry are “urgent hirings,” he said, meaning that film production companies need people to work as soon as possible.
“Film-related jobs are typically short-term; most of them are only six-months or one year at the most,” Liu said. Once these positions are filled out for the project, they will no longer be looking for other applicants until the next project comes along. “That’s why it may be more challenging than other types of jobs,” he said.
Students on OPT after graduation are only allowed a total of 90 days of unemployment. Once the limit is passed, their OPTs are no longer valid and they must leave the country. This means they are on a tight deadline from the moment they receive their degrees, placing greater pressure on them to start job-searching long before their American peers. 
For non-STEM graduates, a limited work time of one year means fewer employers are willing to hire them for long-term positions.
There are currently over one million international students studying in the U.S. In the World Education Services report, international students and alumni currently residing in the United States spoke about their current status and challenges facing graduation. Half (51 percent) of international alumni were on OPT or Academic Training. Among these alumni residing in the U.S., the two biggest challenges are work authorization challenges (69 percent) and lack of professional connections (47 percent).

“The opportunities that are available to U.S. citizens and permanent residents are vastly different,” said immigration attorney Mary Walsh in a Zoom interview. She explained the three main challenges for international students to get a job: lack of in-school work opportunities, hurdles of a student’s chosen degree program — with an emphasis of the U.S. preferring STEM degrees — and the slim opportunities of the lottery-based system of getting an H-1B visa. 
But Liu sees yet another hurdle: racism against Asians within the film industry. In light of the recent asian hate crimes within the country, Liu is anxious about how his race may affect his chances of landing a job in larger film companies. “I’m concerned, especially with the ongoing racism and constantly changing policies for the immigrants and foreign students from the administration,” Liu said
Only recently has Hollywood been more inclusive of the Asian community with the productions of “Crazy Rich Asians,” “Minari,” and “Raya and the Last Dragon,” to name a few. With most of his film friends back home in China, Liu said he does not have the network he would like to jumpstart his career in the American film industry. 
Many international students unknowingly believe their path to finding a job in the U.S. might look the same as their domestic friends and classmates, but that is rarely the case. 
Patrick Mandiraatmadja, a business administration graduate from Boston University, understood these disadvantages placed on him as an international student, so he started networking years before he received his diploma in January of 2020. 
“The biggest challenge with international students finding a job is that they don’t know how to start,” he said. “The only reason why I have a job right now is because I started early in my sophomore year.”
Mandiraatmadja mentioned that out of the “hundreds” of jobs he applied to, he received “close to 10” interviews, most of which he received from his networking efforts rather than his job applications.
Starting April 2021, Mandiraatmadja works as a private equity analyst at Search Fund Accelerator. 
“Many employers are not willing to take on the responsibility and additional compliance concerns to hire a foreign student graduate,” said Robert Cohen, an immigration attorney with Porter Wright Morris & Arthur in Ohio. “However, my experience with the employers I represent is that they recognize that the foreign student population presents a very rich source of talent that can be of significant benefit to their business.”
The National Association of Colleges and Employers (NACE) surveyed 24 employers about their plans to hire international students in the year 2020. The number was at its lowest in 2018 at 23.4 percent, but has been steadily increasing to 30.4 percent in 2020. Source: The National Association of Colleges and Employers Job Outlook 2020
A limited employment time of one year for non-STEM graduates and up to three years for STEM graduates discourages many employers from hiring international students. Most companies prefer those who will be able to stay and work for a longer period of time. 
And although international students are eligible for H-1B visas, a status that would allow them to work in the United States as an industry professional, the lottery-based system of receiving those visas only gives each student around a 30 percent chance. Most companies are not willing to take that risk. 
With so many obstacles ahead of them, international students have to take a lot more effort and initiative than their American peers. And though they try their best, the system is not always in their favor and some have no choice but to return to their home countries or pursue a career elsewhere.
But receiving approval on their OPTs and finding a job are not the only challenges international students must face. With COVID, a new set of hurdles arises.
In the same way that the pandemic stopped Liu from going to Los Angeles, the pandemic stopped Dionysius Hanubrata’s potential job offer in its tracks.
Having secured interviews with multiple companies in the U.S., Hanubrata was looking forward to gaining a couple years of work experience before heading back home to Jakarta, Indonesia. He worked in silicon valley for a couple years after his undergraduate studies, before deciding to pursue a master’s at Cornell University. In the same way that he thought a master’s degree would better equip him for future jobs in Indonesia, he felt another couple years of work after graduation would too. 
Hanubrata entered the final round of interviews for an electric vehicle producer in California until the pandemic hit in early 2020. He said that the company, along with many others he applied to, froze the hiring process, Hanubrata said based on the emails he received.
Graduated from Cornell University with a masters in Operations Research and Information Engineering in May 2020, Hanubrata saw the effects COVID on job hirings. After realizing that the job market was not doing well, Hanubrata returned home in August 2020. 
He is now working in the analytics department of a property tech startup in Jakarta, which Hanubrata said aligns with a project he had thought of doing on his own.
While some are forced to return to their home countries because of COVID-19, Liu is still in his Cambridge apartment scrolling through job options that would allow him to stay in the country. 
As of April 2021, Liu landed two short-term contract-based jobs with JL Cambridge International and Tindragon Media. Even with two jobs, Liu works no more than 10 hours. But according to USCIS, OPT requires a minimum of 20 working hours per week. Within a tight deadline, he still needs to find a job that can count towards OPT requirements. 
“Going home is definitely the first choice because you don’t have to worry about anything else,” Liu said.  If he can’t find an OPT-compliant job in the U.S. he intends to find one in Canada or Japan. As he is currently learning Japanese, Japan would be his first choice, said Liu. 
“If I have a chance to stay here, let’s say, like have an H-1B visa or maybe another visa, to stay for five more years,” Liu said, “I’m really happy to do it. But the problem is that it’s just not really pragmatic.” 
Each year, the number of H-1B visas given out is limited to 65,000 people with a bachelor’s degree and 20,000 people with a master’s. With the number of applicants normally three times the amount of allotments — with over 200,000 petitions entered during the 2019-2020 lottery season — the chances of someone with a bachelor’s getting the H-1B is only about 30 to 34 percent, and 40 to 45 percent for those with a master’s, according to Walsh.
The 90-day unemployment limit still looms over Liu as he struggles to find employment with a minimum of 20 working hours. He needs to be hired before May 24, or else he will be overstaying his F-1 visa and forced home. But he is persistent and hopeful he will find one that suits him as job openings and the film hiring season for the summer starts again.   
“We don’t really benefit that much from any immigration rules,” he said. “That’s why having the skills, and habit, and networking is the priority.”

20210521,UMass Boston students honor deceased at Chinese burial ground,"(請點這裡閱讀中文版。) 
On May 12, students from the University of Massachusetts Boston’s class, Boston’s Asian American Communities, met in person for the first time on a trip to visit the Chinese burial grounds at Mt. Hope Cemetery. Led by Professor Peter Kiang, the class visited the site in part to remember the lost lives of Asian American workers in the Atlanta shootings, while they also discussed the issues of injustice represented by the condition of the tombstones. In more ways than one, the cemetery is a symbol.
“This was such a year of loss,” said Kiang. “…It is a beautiful space. It is supposed to be a rest in peace space. But honestly, compared with the rest of the cemetery, [when it comes to] inequality [because of], race, language, culture, immigrant status, and money – there’s less status and recognition in this corner of the cemetery. No one can come here and not see it with their own eyes.” He added, “We are seeing inequality, historically, in the public cemetery in Boston, in relation to Asian American communities, in death, not just in life.”
According to Kiang, the Chinese immigrant burial grounds are a demonstration of racialized segregation of Boston’s Chinese immigrants after their passing. The gravestones are notably smaller and simpler than those in the rest of the cemetery, and many are crumbling or deteriorating, gathering weeds. In an essay written by Kiang, he describes how the upkeep of the Chinese burial grounds are in many ways a reflection of the City’s historic attitudes towards Asian American immigrants.
“More importantly, though, the City’s obvious neglect of the public cemetery’s Chinese section mirrored the unequal levels of quality, care, and attention throughout the City’s racially segregated streets, schools, and neighborhoods. By the 1980’s, hundreds of the Chinese gravestones had eroded or been broken and displaced, due to vandalism and institutional disregard as well as the cumulative effects of harsh winter weather in Boston and the low-cost, poor quality of materials originally used for the stones,” writes Kiang.
In the past, Asian American Studies students, faculty, and alumni have participated in cleanup actions and documentation projects. Student Jaely Pereira spoke to the importance of honoring the memory of Chinese immigrants, many of whom have been “othered” through the segregation of the tombstones, and she said that she wondered whether the deceased have family members nearby to hold them in their thoughts and visit the site. Tianmi Feng, a teaching assistant in Kiang’s Introduction to Asian American Studies class, said that it is important for the lives to be respected.
“Maybe the people who are resting in peace here don’t even have families anymore in the US. Maybe they moved out of the US – we never know,” said Feng. “They have to be memorialized. They have to be remembered. That is the reason why I come here, because I don’t want them to be forgotten.”  
The students were excited to be convening in person for the first time. Tran Do, who is not in the class but was visiting with a friend, said that the pandemic and virtual learning have posed challenges for students, being unable to meet classmates or professors in person. Kira Mathiesen, who is a student in Kiang’s course, said that meeting up with the class was an uplifting chance for everyone to come together.
“We’re still able, as students, to connect and just pick it up, even though there was no starting point – there was a virtual one. Naturally, we were kind of all here for each other,” said Mathiesen. “[…]It’s refreshing.”
Pereira remarked on the tragic events that the country has born witness to and emphasized that people must continue to honor the lives of people of color, not only as a response to hate crimes or acts of discrimination.
“Especially with everything that’s happened this past year, it’s really important to recognize and uplift multiracial and interracial solidarity,” said Pereira. “[…] It’s important to not just honor after something happens or for a certain month but to uplift Asian American lives and experiences, as well as people of color’s lives and experiences, throughout the whole year, and it is important for communities of color to come together and honor each other’s lives and stories,” said Pereira.
Kiang said that many of the deceased at the burial ground were working class immigrants who died from tuberculosis, a disease that is similar in transmission to the coronavirus. Having a public cemetery where individuals can find a peaceful resting place is important, though the burial ground is linguistically, culturally, and racially segregated and suffers from a lack of attention.
“Many of the men who were here died of tuberculosis,” said Kiang, “without the family members, the support to have their bones returned to their home villages, where the proper recognition and accounting for their life and their generational representation and their linkage across generations would be taken care of. It’s not taken care of here, in general. And so we do our part.”

20210521,New volunteer program may bring security to Chinatown seniors,"(請點這裡閱讀中文版。) 
While the Greater Boston area has not yet faced any reported violent incidents, the increased frequency of vicious anti-Asian crimes in cities and towns across the United States has left Asian residents around Chinatown Boston in a state of unease.  For some, this growing threat unfortunately extends what has already been a long year of isolation and hardship, following on the heels of an already trying pandemic.
“They have been staying at home over a year, and they don’t often go out…we are opening the Senior Center, but they don’t want to go out.  They are aware of what’s going on, and of course, it is a concern.  So they stay home,” says Ruth Moy, Executive Director of the Greater Boston Chinese Golden Age Center.  The Golden Age Center provides services to elderly Asian residents around the Boston area.
While concerns about anti-Asian hate have limited social outings, for some seniors, it has impacted their willingness to seek out essential services. “We completely understand how recent incidents of violence against the Asian community, combined with the COVID-19 pandemic, have led to apprehension in our Chinatown patients to come to the hospital for needed appointments and regular check-ups,” said Michael Tarnoff, MD, Interim President and CEO of Tufts Medical Center. “We are grateful to the AACA for launching this simple, yet innovative program to help our valued patients and friends in the community ensure that they can attend appointments safely, while building new relationships.”
To help senior and other at-risk Asian residents around Chinatown to mitigate fear caused by anti-Asian racism, the Asian American Civic Association (AACA) is bringing together organizations and individuals across Chinatown to launch a new community service program – AACA’s Bayara program, Buddy Guards for Chinatown. Volunteers from the program accompany seniors from their homes to the store, to medical appointments, or other stops around Chinatown, giving seniors the comfort of having strength in numbers.
“AACA is committed to supporting our community.  There are many organizations that have stepped up to help Asians around Greater Boston during these difficult times.  The reality though is an individual by themselves, even with tools or training, is still very vulnerable.  There is the old Chinese proverb – You cannot clap with just one hand. (孤掌難鳴) We need to come together as a community,” said Edward Hsieh, Chief Operating Officer of AACA. 
AACA has volunteer support from the Eastern Kung Fu Federation of New England, a historical association founded in 1977 by local schools like Gin Soon Tai Chi Chuan Federation and Wah Lum Kung Fu Athletic Association, and from student clubs at Boston University and Boston College.  AACA will also be granting work release time to its own employees to encourage them to give back directly to the community.
“I believe this volunteer program is a great opportunity for organizations to get together and give back to the community.  We need to come together in support for our elders. I’m really looking forward to seeing more martial arts schools and Chinatown organizations come together to show solidarity and promote safety and well-being together,” says Sifu Jing Woo on behalf of the Eastern Kung Fu Federation. 
An AACA coordinator will schedule volunteers into time slots.  Residents of the Golden Age Center and patients from the South Cove Community Health Center will contact the AACA coordinator to make reservations for volunteers to meet with the resident or patient. Other apprehensive residents around Chinatown will be able to access the program by calling in to the coordinator or by filling out an appointment form on the AACA website.
“By matching seniors with volunteers, the seniors can feel safer taking a walk outside in Chinatown, whether that’s down to a grocery or over to Tufts for a vital medical appointment.  Even more than the feeling of strength in numbers though, it is important that after this rough year, after this hiatus of banquets and shared activities, to bring people together in Chinatown,” said Mary Chin, Chief Executive Officer at AACA.

20210521,Immigrants’ Day speakers say no recovery without immigrants,"(請點這裡閱讀中文版。) 
On May 4, the Massachusetts Immigration and Refugee Advocacy Coalition (MIRA) held its 25th annual Immigrants’ Day at the State House, as a virtual speaking program, followed by regional roundtables. 
Present at the talk were Mayor Kim Janey, Senate President Pro Tempore William Brownsberger, Representative Ruth Balser, and two leaders of MIRA member organizations, Dalida Rocha, political director of Service Employees International Union Local 615, and Gabriel Camacho, political director of United Food and Commercial Workers Union Local 1445. The unifying theme at the presentation was the idea that no recovery can happen without immigrants.
“It has been an exhausting 12 months since our last Immigrants’ Day,” said MIRA President and CEO Eva Millona. “We experienced loss; we experienced pain; but we also witnessed the strength and the resilience of immigrant communities. Immigrants have been critical during the crisis, keeping food on our tables, caring for the sick, and playing a vital role in the development of the vaccine. Today, it’s all about them and making sure that as we move towards recovery, immigrants are heard; immigrants are supported.”
On the State level, Janey spoke to the importance of making the Safe Communities Act a priority, barring police and court officers from inquiring about immigration status. It is essential to both vaccine equity and equity in general, she said, recognizing that fear of being detained has prevented many undocumented individuals from getting the lifesaving vaccine. Janey also said that she would support the passage of the Work and Family Mobility Act, legislation that “would extend eligibility to driver’s licenses to all qualified state residents, regardless of immigration status. It’s important for people to have access to transportation that will get them to work, home, and school, and it’s also important to have identification.”
“The protection of immigrants rights to education, housing, and well being is an essential priority for a city-wide agenda of recovery, reopening, and renewal. As mayor, I am committed to the economic and social empowerment of our city’s immigrant populations,” said Janey. “My administration is creating a Boston where equity and inclusion are at the center of everything that we do, and that certainly includes immigrants in our city, because there is no recovery without immigrants.”
Brownsberger addressed the fact that immigrants have been on the front lines during the pandemic, working in retail, grocery stores, hospitals, delivery, and in vaccine development. The immigrant community has been hard hit as a result, both in terms of health and economically, and Brownsberger said that his concern is making sure that this population has access to relief. Looking to a “new normal,” it is important to make sure that “everybody stays on the boat,” said Brownsberger.
Rocha emphasized that immigrants without status should have the right to drive, pointing out that many have been forced to take crowded transportation, a hazard during the pandemic. Camacho stated that there must be a disentanglement between the local law enforcement and the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency. 
“In 2021, the Safe Communities Act is so crucial, not only to restore trust with local law enforcement, but with the entire government itself writ large,” said Camacho. “We have seen over decades, especially over the last four years, how the government no longer serves the people. We must make government at every level work for the people, and not only in the prison-industrial complex, nor for contractors building useless billion dollar walls. We cannot just decry and denounce the racist and xenophobic policies of the Trump administration and not get our own house in order.”
Balser applauded the fact that President Joe Biden lifted the cap on refugee admissions to 62,500, from the previous 15,000 that it stood at before. As one of the sponsors of the Safe Communities Act, she said that its passage would alleviate the burdens that the coronavirus has placed on immigrants.
“The Safe Communities Act would make sure that people in the immigrant community wouldn’t have to be worried about getting tested for COVID,” said Balser. “They wouldn’t have to be worried to go get their vaccination. They wouldn’t have to worry that someone is going to talk to ICE and let them know something about themselves or someone in their family. We want people to feel safe, and so we want to pass a bill that says there will be no local or state involvement with federal immigration enforcement.”

20210521,Students to distribute safety alarms for Asian American elderly,"(請點這裡閱讀中文版。) 
In light of attacks against Asian American elderly that have been happening across the country, a group of students are taking matters into their own hands. The youth will be partnering with the Boston Police Department and three senior houses around Chinatown to distribute alarm devices to Asian American seniors. Cindy Ho, her sons Ryan and Kyle Ho, as well as friends Justin Mok, Alexander McKay, and Brendan Szeto held a fundraiser and ordered approximately 700 devices, which will be handed out at the Chinatown Gate.
“Seeing all the Asian hate crimes across America, and knowing that I have my own 88-year old grandmother, I wanted to find a way to help elderly in the Asian American community in Boston, so that none of these hate crimes could occur, to combat them,” said Ryan. “After brainstorming ideas, I saw that a family friend in New York actually had done this already. I gathered a few of my friends here, and we decided to make it and adapt it to Boston. We really wanted to find a way to provide a sense of safety and security for the elderly Asian American community.”
The team launched a GoFundMe page in April and were able to raise $4,000 in one weekend.  They met mostly virtually to coordinate, communicating over Zoom and also texting about their ideas. According to Ryan, the alarm is a battery powered device, and when you hit a button on it, it sets off a loud sound that will startle an attacker and alert others around if the user is being harassed. The alarms will also be handed out at senior housing sites, Quincy Tower, and buildings on Stuart Street and Tremont Street. The friends said that they have encountered casual instances of racism before and do have some anxieties about the kinds of hate crimes that could happen in Boston.
“For me, I feel safe when I am around Chinatown. But my dad works around restaurants as a repairman. A lot of those restaurants have been getting threatened,” said Szeto. He added, “When my dad went to pick up dinner once, someone threatened him, while he was picking up the food. They said, ‘You caused this. You’re why we have to wear masks.’”
According to Stephen Moy, sergeant of Boston Police Department’s District One, which includes Chinatown, there is some crime in Chinatown, but the fear of crime is a more persistent and debilitating problem. He said that he hopes handing out the alarms will help reduce anxieties. Moy said that he has not seen a serious hate crime against Asians in Boston yet, but he has seen, “the other thing – people in a store might bump into each other by accident, and then someone throws a distasteful comment. I’ve seen a lot of that, but that doesn’t fall into hate crimes.” In the daytime, said Moy, things are “fairly fine,” with some people occasionally drinking in public. At nighttime, officer Steven Chen is positioned by the Chinatown Gate and Mary Soo Hoo Park, walking through Chinatown, beginning around Essex Street. Additionally, officer Zi Zou is stationed in a vehicle and takes many 911 calls. Moy said that he is hopeful about the distribution of the alarms.
“Anything positive wouldn’t hurt,” said Moy. “The extra layer of security wouldn’t hurt. What I don’t want happening is for elderly folks that have the alarm to have a false sense of security. That’s my fear. If you have any elderly Asian person who is walking, and they don’t have the capacity to yell or scream when they need help, and they have the alarm, it’s like a whistle. I think the extra layer is definitely a positive thing – anything extra we can do is great – but my biggest concern is that I don’t want folks to think that the moment they hit the button, they’re going to have a police officer right in front of them. That’s not the case. They have to do other things too, and that’s why we’re handing out cards to go with it. On the card, in Chinese and English, it will say, ‘make sure you know where you’re going at night. Make sure you’re aware of your surroundings. Make sure if you can travel in pairs, that you do that.”
Executive director of the Greater Boston Golden Age Center Ruth Moy said that for now, many seniors are choosing to stay at home. While they may have been doing this because of the pandemic anyway, they are tuned into what has been happening across the country and are being slightly more cautious.
“We have not had any reports of seniors being attacked in any way. Some seniors just don’t go out,” said Moy. “They stay home. But they are aware of what’s happening. […] Even going to the park, they’re very careful, because they’re afraid that something might happen. So they don’t stay out long.”

20210416,Chinatown prepares for MA Phase 3 vaccine distribution,"(請點這裡閱讀中文版。) 
On April 19, the City of Boston will be moving into Phase 3 of the coronavirus vaccine distribution, meaning that individuals 16 years of age and older will be eligible. According to Health and Human Services Chief Marty Martinez, Asian Americans in Boston are getting vaccinated at a similar rate as white residents, and with the new phase approaching, he said that he is hopeful there will be strong vaccination turnout from this population.
“For people of color across the country, [they] have been less likely to get vaccinated. Actually, in the City of Boston, Asian Americans are getting vaccinated at pretty much the same rate as white Bostonians,” said Martinez. “…We also see our Asian seniors are getting vaccinated at a comparable rate as our white seniors. That’s because of the really important work of community groups and community organizations, whether it’s in the Chinese community in Chinatown or the Vietnamese community in Dorchester. It’s been important to see these community nonprofit organizations do a bunch of work to engage their residents and work with the City to be able to do that.”
According to Gabriela Andujar Vazquez, an infectious disease physician and associate hospital epidemiologist at Tufts Medical Center, Asian Americans do face barriers to getting vaccinated. Language barriers may be a challenge, and to address this problem, Tufts has partnered with the City of Boston to create a voucher program. The City is distributing about a hundred vouchers per day to the Chinatown community, and the vouchers can be used to set up an appointment, without having to call a phone number or schedule online. It has a date when they can come to their appointment, and individuals can show up at the Marriott Hotel, where a clinic is located. Frequently asked questions and directions are provided, and the voucher offers translations in Cantonese and Mandarin.
“Even if you’re good with computers, getting an appointment can be challenging,” said Andujar Vazquez. “We’re certainly seeing an increase in the supply. …But certainly, I think the Asian American community has a lot of different barriers, not only language, but access and information. There are definitely different factors that are contributing, for vaccine equity. Around here [in Chinatown], the age may be a factor, in terms of mobility. We have 80 year olds who may not be able to walk to the Marriott clinic, even if it’s two blocks away. Age is an important factor; [there may be] medical problems that make it difficult to get to the vaccine clinic. Language is always one: when you’re not English speaking, it’s just by default a barrier.”
Tufts is also creating rotating mobile clinics in the Chinatown neighborhood. They have already held one in Tai Tung Village and will be collaborating with business owners, with the intention of helping restaurant workers. Through these clinics, Tufts is hoping to do about 200 vaccines a day, said Andujar Vazquez. The idea behind this method is that the service will be coming to the people who need it, rather than the other way around.   
“Wherever there’s a need, we can work out the logistics of coming to the community,” said Andujar Vazquez.
There will certainly be vaccine hesitancy among undocumented immigrants, who may worry that they will have to disclose information, according to Paul Watanabe, director of the Institute for Asian American Studies at the University of Massachusetts Boston and a member of the City’s COVID-19 Health Inequities Task Force. Watanabe said that they should know that they are not required to disclose their immigration status at vaccination sites. Martinez added that because of the uptick in hate crimes against Asian Americans, he said that he is worried that this population may be reluctant to go out to a vaccination site.
“I am concerned that that would add an additional barrier for Asian Bostonians to get vaccinated,” said Martinez.
Watanabe said that he hopes that there will be less reluctance among communities of color to take the vaccine, and outreach will play an important role in creating this change. The Task Force continues to work with local organizations, many of which are in Chinatown and Fields Corner, and the partnerships with these trusted groups has been helpful in overcoming hesitancy. 
“They help to assure their communities that the vaccines are safe and necessary, and at the same time, they push the City to make sure those vaccines are made available to those communities,” said Watanabe. “I think it can be an effective working relationship.” He added, “[The Task Force] is making sure that if there is a paucity in testing in the Chinatown area, ideas have been put forward, for example, to see that sites are opened up–even pop up sites, within Chinatown, are made available.”

20210319,Hudson Group and CEDC break new ground with innovative PingOn development,"(請點這裡閱讀中文版。)
Anchoring the North East corner of Chin Park, and Chinatown, stands the gleaming residential tower known as The Radian, its name owed to its curved façade. Older neighbors might remember the remnants of the old Dainty Dot Hosiery factory, dark and squat and dormant, about the polar opposite of the new tower. 
One of the more interesting aspects of the Radian development was the innovative way its developers sought to address the need for affordable housing. 
Radian worked with Chinese Economic Development Council (CEDC) to buy and consolidate parcels on Oxford Street to create 67 affordable housing units. Rather than keeping a smaller percentage (13% is called for in Boston’s Inclusionary Development Policy) of the Radian development as affordable, this unique partnership netted more affordable housing in Chinatown, at 14 Oxford St. 
The CEDC was established in 1974 to assist the low income and often non-English speaking Asian residents of Boston’s Chinatown to achieve economic and social self-sufficiency. The CEDC evolved from its predecessor, the Chinese Local Development Corporation.
The unique partnership leveraged the experience of the Hudson Group (the Radian developers) to the benefit of CEDC, permitting help, cash contributions and so on. The creation of that many affordable units exceeded by a good measure what the developers were required to include in the building. As defined in the Boston Zoning Code, Boston’s Development Impact Project Exactions (“DIP” or “Linkage”) ensures that large-scale real estate development brings direct benefits to the City of Boston’s residents in the form of affordable housing and workforce training. 
Debbie Ho, Executive Director of Chinatown Mainstreet said, “There’s always a balance to pretty much any development; the linkage funds requirement by every developer [is] a way to be able to build housing and fund projects. The Radian was the best project for Chinatown; the partnership was huge with a totally new building, from buying the land and to build all affordable housing, all by the Radian project.”
With the limited space in Boston Chinatown, residents are often met with having to decide which type of development would best support the needs of the community. Angie Liou, Executive Director of the Asian Community Development Corporation said, “Developable sites are so hard to come by, and so the community is often forced to choose between various amenities, e.g. affordable housing, open space, and schools. The City is moving forward with building a new Josiah Quincy Upper School on Parcel A, and that was for many years designated as an affordable housing site as well.”
Noam Ron, of Hudson Group said, “This was not a “cut a blank check” linkage agreement, but rather we rolled up our sleeves and actually pushed for actual housing creation. It was a real collaboration. Interesting timing as we’re actually looking to build on this successful model with our Kneeland Street project.”
Hudson is redeveloping a 22-story residential building with approximately 115 units. Originally conceived of as a boutique hotel, the firm reimagined it, in light of the needs of the city, post-pandemic. The new project will create new housing adjacent to South Station and provide a sorely needed affordable housing contribution, among other neighborhood benefits. Hudson’s website notes its long history here, 25+ years and their “robust community engagement process.” The Oxford Street collaboration is an example of that and we’re eager to see what will come of this new project.

20210319,Preserving Chinatown’s Row Houses for Working Families,"by Lydia Lowe, Chinatown Community Land Trust
(請點這裡閱讀中文版。)
The Chinatown Community Land Trust (CLT) is particularly focused on preserving row houses and small properties as permanently affordable housing. Currently there are seven row house condo units for sale.  (The lottery has already been held for these units.) 
History of the Row Houses
Chinatown’s brick row houses date back to the early/mid-1800s, when landfill projects first created the South Cove neighborhood. Many of these homes were built by Irish immigrants and later occupied by Eastern European, Syrian and Lebanese, and finally Chinese immigrant working class families. 
Old-timers still recall the days when parents sat on the stoops watching their United Nations of children play together in the streets. But hundreds of homes were lost to bulldozers during the Urban Renewal and highway construction of the 1950s and 1960s, then to institutional expansion by Tufts University and Tufts Medical Center in the 1970s and 1980s. Many buildings fell into disrepair, but for several decades they remained as affordable homes for new immigrant families. (For a fuller history, read Forever Struggle: Activism, Identity, & Survival in Boston’s Chinatown, 1880-2018 by Michael Liu.)
With the increase in luxury development and the growth of the short-term rental industry, many residents were evicted from the row houses in recent years, with speculative investors turning the units into full-time short term rentals through Airbnb or other platforms. Others proposed enlarging the buildings to be more attractive to high-end buyers.
Permanent Affordability and Community Ownership
Chinatown CLT is working on a community-led model of preservation, seeking to preserve not only historic homes and buildings but also their historic role as homes for immigrant and working class families. The City of Boston’s Community Preservation Committee recently recommended the organization for a historic preservation grant.
Chinatown CLT has returned its first seven units to the permanent housing stock by reclaiming them from short term rental use. The organization also seeks to either purchase from or partner with long-time property owners with a shared vision of stabilizing the Chinatown community .
Through community ownership of the land, Chinatown CLT can ensure that 99-year affordability and resale agreements are enforced, so that the homes will always be affordable to working class households. The organization also maintains an ongoing support role for residents, and works to involve people in community governance and decision-making.
Protecting Core Row House Streets
Community members have called for a Row House Protection Area with zoning guidelines more similar to other neighborhoods’ row house streets, which could include core small-scale streets like Oak Street, Johnny Court, Harvard Street, Tyler and Hudson Streets south of Kneeland, Oxford Street, and Oxford Place.  Designation of Chinatown as a Historic District could be another way to provide a community-led commission more involvement in development and demolition decision-making.
Development of Chinatown as a Cultural District and a variety of public art projects is another way to preserve and improve the neighborhood’s row house streets, which have recently seen an increase in graffiti on people’s homes.  Plans are beginning for an Immigrant History Trail, which can include historic buildings, legacy businesses, or other landmarks important to the community. If you are interested in joining the Immigrant History Trail Committee or in learning about other ways to preserve our row house streets, email participate@ChinatownCLT.org or leave a voicemail at 617.259.1503.

20210319,Planned development in Leather District sparks controversy among residents,"(請點這裡閱讀中文版。)
Oxford Properties Group, a Canadian real estate and development company, plans to build a 225 feet tall “research and development” property on 125 Lincoln Street. The project, which is currently under review, according to the Boston Planning and Development Agency’s website, is controversial among some local residents.
Oxford Properties Group’s most recently accessible public commenting period for residents to voice their concerns was from June 7, 2019 to July 30, 2019. During that period, a majority of the concerns were about the tower’s original 340 feet height and its implications for Chinatown and the Leather District. 
“A building of this size has the potential to create wind tunnels and overbearing shadows,” Michelle Wu, a Boston city council member, wrote on July 30, 2019. Other concerns included the fact that the proposed height was significantly above the allowed maximum of 100 feet for the area.
After hearing these concerns, Oxford Properties Group revised the final height to its currently-planned 225 feet. “The updated proposal reflects their [local residents] collective feedback. It substantially increases and enhances public realm and open space … Most importantly, it shows 125 Lincoln one-third smaller in both height and density,” Mark McGowan, the head of development for Boston’s Oxford Properties Group said in a December 2020 press release.
While Oxford Properties Group has had numerous other public meetings following the closure of their first comment period, some still feel that they still aren’t being transparent enough in their process.
“We are following the standard steps in the Boston Planning and Development Authority (BPDA) Article 80 review for large projects. This includes detailed filings on all aspects of the project, community engagement and expert review from key city agencies,” Oxford Properties Group’s statement wrote.
Currently, Oxford Properties Group is in another public commenting period that started on December 16, 2020 and will run until March 31, 2021, but some local’s concerns have stayed the same across both commenting periods. Arturo Gossage, a member of the Chinatown Residents Association, said the primary concern of Chinatown residents is the intended use for the development.
“A lot of residents don’t want there to be a biolab there,” Gossage said. “They want to see more housing built in that area, and they want things like the Asian grocery store and restaurants like Hei La Moon to remain behind.”
And while Oxford Properties Group has not yet implemented housing into their plans — the development is still entirely commercial. Thanks to Boston’s development linkage program, the developers are required to pay $15.39 per square foot of the development, which will go towards funding affordable housing programs. According to the Feb. 18 public meeting, they said 2.8 million linkage money will be generated.
Oxford Properties Groups also defends that their development will bring “new and better visual and physical community connections.” 
McGowan said, “New and wider sidewalks, more plantings, and lighting that links the area with The Greenway will make the site much more pedestrian-friendly, with natural locations for the neighborhood to gather and activate.”
Jacqueline Church, a member of the Leather District Neighborhood Association (LDNA) and other long-time residents, however, feel that the development will have “a visual feel of walling off our neighborhood [Leather District] from Chinatown.”
At the moment, the primary concern of most residents is that feeling of disconnect from other parts of Chinatown. In a public virtual meeting held on February 18, 2021, Wenyin Kao*, a local resident, brought up worries about the future of Hei La Moon, which will most likely have to relocate due to disruption that construction on the development would cause. “Hei La Moon is a place for Chinatown community members to be, and now [Oxford Properties Group] is displacing them,” Kao said.
Oxford Properties Group wrote in their presentation during the meeting that they are working closely together with Hei La Moon in ensuring a “successful transition,” and that they specifically will help in finding a new spot for the restaurant as well as provide financial support for the move. While it was not vocally addressed during the meeting, it was written on their presentation that this is what they plan on doing. 
The current public commenting period ends on March 31st. If you would like to submit a comment, please visit this BPDA’s website through this link. If you would like to comment on this project for the next Sampan article, please email editor@sampan.org and tell us what you think.

20210319,Increased linkage fees supports affordable housing and workforce development in Boston,"(請點這裡閱讀中文版。)
In February, Mayor Martin Walsh announced the official increase of linkage fees by 42%. Now, for any commercial development over 100,000 square feet in Boston, $15.39 per square foot will be collected as linkage fees, of which $13.00 will contribute to supporting affordable housing and $2.39 will go towards workforce development programs in the city. 
Originally created in 1986, the Boston Linkage Program was established to leverage funding for the community from large-scale commercial real-estate development. For years, the linkage rate remained at $10.81 per square foot, of which $9.03 is dedicated to affordable housing and $1.78 goes towards workforce development. Originally, the Boston Planning and Development Agency was only allowed to adjust linkage every three years based on inflation, but the rate was unchanged for several years. 
After seven years of advocacy exacerbated by the challenging economic climate due to the COVID-19 pandemic, linkage has finally been increased. “Before the passage of the legislation, the city could increase linkage to CPI which is the consumer price index, without permission from the state, but they didn’t do that all the years that they could have done it,” said Amy Nishman, representing the Job Training Alliance. Nishman said, “We’re far behind where we could have been even if they had just been doing the thing that they were already allowed.” 
Beginning with advocacy, the City conducted a Nexus study to assess the situation before the ask was forwarded to the City Council. After a unanimous agreement to increase linkage, the resolution was passed to the mayor, to create a Home Rule Petition. This petition requested the state to allow Boston to adjust the linkage fees. After the mayor signed the petition, the State House finally passed it, allowing Boston to increase linkage to the newest rate.
This increase contributes to maintaining balance among the city’s communities. Nishman said, “We recognize that when big development comes in. There are a stream of people who follow that, who make housing unaffordable, and often the jobs are not accessible to all income brackets.”
One of the major issues for those in the low-income bracket is affordable housing, which has been exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic. Karen Chen, representing the Coalition for Truly Affordable Boston, said, “In the city of Boston, more than 50% of the people pay more than 50% of the income towards rent. And with COVID, sometimes it’s 70 or 80% that goes towards rent.”
Also the Executive Director of the Chinese Progressive Association, Chen said, “In Chinatown especially, a lot of people are squeezed into smaller apartments. We have actually seen in one of the apartments in Chinatown, a three bedroom apartment, [wherein] more than a dozen people live there. Basically one family shares one bedroom, because of the drastic increase in rent, but also because there isn’t enough affordable housing.”
The linkage money for affordable housing is administered by the Neighborhood Housing Trust through the Department of Neighborhood Development (DND). Boston’s DND is “responsible for housing the homeless, developing affordable housing, and managing the City’s real estate.” The linkage money will go towards approved developments of affordable housing units.
“But if you don’t give them self empowerment to then support themselves, they may not be able to keep that cheap housing,” said Edward Hsieh, COO of the Asian American Civic Association (AACA). On the workforce development and job training front, the linkage money is administered through the Neighborhood Jobs Trust (NJT). The NJT is one of the many sources of funding for job training services and programs for low-income individuals in the City of Boston.
Nishman, also the SVP of the Jewish Vocational Service, said, “Linkage is this amazing tool to try to be an equalizer, to try to level the playing field. Effective job training can move low-income Boston residents up the economic ladder.”
Both of these aspects are important ways in which linkage money can help the economy recover from COVID-19. While this fee increase has great implications for both affordable housing and workforce development, this is only the first step. As Nishman said, “We hope to collaborate with the city to come up with an increase in linkage that can work for both the development community and help the residents of the city of Boston have more options for affordable homes, and more options for job training.”

20210305,Will apprenticeships help save the US workforce in pandemic aftermath?,"By Carey Lin (To read this post in Chinese, please click here.)
On Feb 17, the Biden administration announced their goal of providing better-paying work opportunities for Americans, beginning with the Apprenticeship Act of 2021, which includes putting $400 million into apprenticeship programs. While the act has yet to pass, the Department of Labor (DoL) has also announced that they will be taking action to strengthen and streamline the Registered Apprenticeship Program to ensure that it can better meet the needs of the U.S. workforce recovering from pandemic’s economic impacts. 
The Registered Apprenticeship Program is a U.S. DoL or state apprenticeship validated apprenticeship model wherein workers receive an education while being paid for their labor, in preparation for well-paid jobs and careers. Sampan spoke to a nonprofit and job training organization, the Asian American Civic Association (AACA), to better understand how apprenticeship programs differ from internships and what the new act means for workforce development.
Edward Hsieh, Chief Operating Officer of AACA explained, “There are two types of apprenticeships. There’s the union apprenticeships, wherein you really cannot get into that industry unless you do an apprenticeship. Then you have a type of apprenticeship which is more for if you get into this career path, these are the types of steps you have to take to get promotions.” The latter, according to Hsieh, acts less like a “gatekeeper,” and instead helps people both prepare for the career knowing the career trajectory. 
Registered apprenticeships are validated by the DoL and meet certain requirements such as requiring the apprentice to be paid an actual wage as opposed to a stipend which is common for internships. “Also, the implications of apprenticeship has education or class time required. In other words, some kind of book learning. Unlike an internship, you’re still learning during the actual official curriculum during that period [of your apprenticeship],” said Hsieh. “When it comes down to it, the way apprenticeships put you into fields which do require a lot more technical expertise certifications; the apprenticeship is designed to gear you up for that.”
On the employer side, creating a registered apprenticeship program is not easy due to all the standards and requirements they are beholden to. However, the long-term benefits are something worth considering. According to the DoL website, “it helps employers recruit, build, and retain a highly-skilled workforce. George Lumpkins, Program Manager at AACA said, “For instance, an entry-level [individual] coming in on apprenticeship level, and then [they’re] working your way through to a master level technician. The buy in is that we don’t have to go out and recruit, you don’t have to spend money on marketing folks and you can build from within.”
While strengthening the Registered Apprenticeship Program may serve several benefits, there are challenges in achieving the goals of the new Apprenticeship Act. Both Hsieh and Lumpkins believe that the challenge is drawing in youth to do apprenticeships. Lumpkins said, “With some of the young folks, they want to come in and I’m either gonna do this job and make this amount of money. But it’s a stepladder, you know, coming in and training and being an apprentice making a minimum base where I can find a job, and then make the money I need to make and do what I need to do.” 
Hsieh adds that apprenticeships have the potential to introduce different careers to the youth. “The young generations aren’t willing to enter certain fields, which is where the apprenticeships come into play. It helps ease them into fields that have not been as interesting to them, which is what we’re seeing in our recruitment as well,” said Hsieh. “The art of the long game has really been lost with the youths.”
Most importantly, the bigger challenge is creating the apprenticeship programs in the first place. Hsieh notes, “There has to be companies that buy in. And especially if the idea is to grow new industries and not just the same electrical, plumbing, and construction careers.”

20210305,Looming MBTA Service Reduction Causes Anxiety Among Local Residents,"MBTA riders took 333,000 daily trips in 2020, a fraction of the 1.26 million trips taken daily in 2019, according to the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority. 
In response to dwindling ridership during the COVID-19 pandemic, the MBTA announced service changes as part of its Forging Ahead initiative, which was created in response to the organization’s $580 million budget shortfall.
On Feb. 23, the MBTA service planning team held a virtual meeting to inform the public about the temporary schedule changes that go into effect in March and April and will affect commuter rail, ferry, subway, bus, and the RIDE paratransit services.
Beginning March 14, the MBTA will reduce the frequency on the Green Line, Orange Line, and Red Line by 20% and the Blue Line by 5%. Kat Benesh, MBTA chief of operations strategy, policy, and oversight, justified making these changes, claiming “the Blue Line and the RIDE, which is our paratransit division, have had the most durable, which means essentially the largest percentage of the ridership has continued to ride.” 
However the MBTA is not just running lines less frequently, it is temporarily suspending some altogether. The affected lines include routes 18, 52, 55, 68, 79, 212, 221, 465, 710. Direct Charlestown and Hingham ferry service is also being temporarily suspended.
The MBTA defended these suspensions by pointing out that there are readily available alternatives within a quarter mile or half mile. They encouraged  everyone who uses those routes to visit the MBTA trip planner to plan an alternative, particularly in those cases where they would be adversely affected by the changes. 
With respect to buses, the MBTA is working closely with Boston colleges and universities to provide 11% discounts on MBTA passes for students through the Semester Pass Program. Degree-granting colleges and universities with full-time course loads, and that are near MBTA transit lines, can offer the program.
As a result of 11 public meetings held during December 2020 during which the public gave their feedback on proposed service changes, MBTA’s Forging Ahead is set to begin in March and April, 2021 with assurances that they will still preserve equitable access and quality services for all the members of the community. 
Alex Train, director of housing and community development in Chelsea, disagrees. “Residents of Chelsea are heavily transit dependent. Approximately 30% of our residents don’t own any type of personal car or personal vehicles, so the MBTA service is an absolute lifeline for them,” Train said. “Many residents depend on [bus route] 112 to both traverse Chelsea to run errands like go to the grocery store or attend a doctor’s appointment at Mass General Hospital or to access other forms of public transportation.” 
Benesh said that the MBTA considers which routes are critical by analysing their use in “communities of color, low income populations, households with no or low car access, and a high number of senior riders or riders with disabilities. These routes have high ridership potential.” 
However that does not explain the suspensions to Train, who says the decision does not consider “a population that comprises foreign born and large concentrations of immigrant families that we work to serve on a daily basis through our city services and programs.”
Train spoke to the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on Chelsea. “Approximately 80% of our residents are frontline workers in our residents are the people that are sustaining the regional economy. They work in hotels, restaurants, they keep the airport going. They also manage the regional food supply. Therefore after the implementation of Forging Ahead, especially the service cuts of route 112, would create some unnecessary burdens for locals in Chelsea and other areas.” 
Due to public feedback, MBTA have changed their initial proposal of 70% available ridership to 75% to 80%. They have also continued bus service past midnight and kept service of the Green Line E to Heath St. intact. 
Nonetheless, Train believes that the MBTA does not take a holistic view, but rather “treats the Chelsea area as no different than a suburban area where the MBTA operates. However, these are communities that have higher public health concerns and they face heightened instances of air pollution, and they are also heavily transit dependent.” 
In terms of what lies ahead and to soothe the anxiety of local citizens, Terrie Chan, the community liaison from MBTA, said in an email statement, “We can increase service frequency when it’s needed, and we are adding service in areas where we’ve seen crowding and steady ridership throughout the pandemic. We can monitor ridership to add service if and when it’s needed. The priority services to add back will also depend on riders’ feedback.”

20210219,"Amidst new state initiatives, bilingual senior home residents reflect on overcoming vaccine hesitancy","For weeks, a coalition of local organizations and medical professionals have urged Governor Charlie Baker to prioritize the state’s minority and immigrant communities during COVID-19 vaccine distribution. Further slowing vaccination efforts, vaccine hesitancy stemming from historical health inequities persists among eligible seniors in those communities.
Two Chinese residents of the Brown Family House, who received the COVID-19 vaccine as part of Phase 1 of Massachusetts’ rollout plan, spoke to Sampan about the experience and why they overcame their vaccine hesitancy. The Harold and Ronald Brown Family House in Brookline is part of 2Life Communities, a senior housing provider in the greater Boston area. It was one of the first senior homes in the state to administer the COVID-19 vaccine to elderly residents. 
Lai Chin, 74, said that initially, she had concerns about vaccine safety and would have preferred to “wait it out” — a more prominent sentiment among minority groups. A state survey of around 300 residents of color found that 36 percent were unlikely to ever get vaccinated or would wait a long time before doing so. More people fell into this category than the 25 percent  of “early adopters,” who said they wanted the vaccine as soon as possible. 
“I really doubted. Well, they do it so fast, who knows the long-term effects? That’s what we were afraid of,” Chin said. She explained that over time, her fears slowly began to diminish after discussing with friends and listening to Dr. Fauci explain on T.V. how the vaccine uses mRNA, not a live virus.
Chin also said that hearing about state-wide shortages incentivized her to get the vaccine while she had the opportunity. CVS administered her the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine on Jan. 16, and the second dose on Feb. 6 right outside her door. One floor at a time, Brown Family House residents were instructed to place a chair in front of their doorway half an hour before their appointment. Then, CVS staff knocked on each door, instructing residents when they could come out to receive the shot. 
Residents were monitored for side effects 15 minutes after getting inoculated and received another check-in later that day, according to Chin. As for side effects, Chin was surprised she “did not feel anything,” not even the arm muscle soreness she experiences after the flu vaccine. The same procedures were used when administering the second dose. 
Another Brown Family House resident, Jeanette Moy, 64, expressed doubts about the vaccine at first too. “I didn’t really want to take the vaccine yet because there’s not enough data, and I wanted to wait until April.” Moy said that because she lives in an elderly housing complex and the virus’s severity, she agreed to for herd immunity reasons. “Because this is a virus, and it can kill you — that’s why I’m taking it. But normally, I don’t take other vaccines, like I don’t take the flu shot because when I take it, I get very sick for three weeks,” Moy added. 
Moy was fatigued for a few days following her first dose. After receiving the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine, she said she experienced stronger flu-like symptoms, such as a migraine, dizziness, and slight fever. 
All Brown Family House residents were given a consent form beforehand and allowed to opt out. Approximately 90% of residents and all staff members chose to take the vaccine.
Workers and residents of congregate settings, including senior residential facilities, were considered a priority group within Phase One, according to the state’s vaccination plan. However, Brown Family House was able to complete their vaccination series sooner than other senior homes because residents were extremely active in calling and writing letters to Gov. Baker’s office, requesting for their prioritization. 
Chin said she felt fortunate to get the vaccine before her other relatives living in senior housing even received notifications. “They asked me, ‘When did you get it? How can I get it?,” Chin said. “At the same time, people are having difficulties making appointments on the computer. So that makes me say, ‘Oh I am lucky.’” 
Those in the current Phase 2 rollout have been plagued with barriers to getting vaccinated like limited doses and the state’s reportedly not user-friendly website. To address some of these concerns, the Baker administration announced a new call center for assisting residents 75 and older with scheduling vaccine appointments. The 211 hotline offers translation services in 100 languages.
 In Boston, language is not included on the form that needs to be completed for the Reggie Lewis registration. However, the city’s Age Strong Commission has tracked some data on the languages of people using the hotline to ensure adequate staffing of workers with various foreign language skills. 
 As of Feb. 16, the most requested language other than English was Spanish at 83 individuals, followed by Cantonese at 71 and Cape Verdean Creole at 51. There were also 12 calls in Mandarin and three in Taishanese. The dataset is incomplete and may not provide a full picture of the calls the Age Strong Commission has received.
“Based on the Age Strong’s experience, language barrier and technology tends to be issues for a lot of lower income older adults and those that do not speak English well or at all,” the mayor’s office said in an email. “That is why Age Strong has a team that people can call on the phone, use a language line, and also work through trusted community partners.”
The Age Strong Commission worked with local partners at the Greater Boston Chinese Golden Age Center, the Chinese Progressive Association, and Boston Senior Home Care to reach out to and navigate vaccine access for Boston’s Chinese seniors 75 and older. 
It has also scheduled onsite vaccine clinics for several senior-living buildings in the city. Moreover, Boston residents age 75 and older can request assistance with vaccine enrollment by calling 311 and asking for the Age Strong Commission, or by calling the State at 211. Literature regarding vaccinations has also been proliferated by the Department of Public Health in a variety of languages, including Chinese, Councilor Ed Flynn told Sampan in a statement.
Still, Moy points to another potential barrier for those not living in senior homes: the lack of vaccine sites near Chinatown, a problem plaguing many other Boston neighborhoods and towns across the state. Currently, the closest mass vaccination site is the Reggie Lewis Center in Roxbury. “Are they going to have a site for Asian people to get the vaccine someplace nearby?,” Moy asked. “Some places are hard for them to go to because some don’t have transportation.”
Moy said the vaccine has not changed her life much, and she still takes precautionary mask-wearing measures. She believes we will only start to see some return to normalcy once “80% of Americans get the vaccine, but some are still reluctant to take it.” For Chin, although receiving the COVID-19 vaccine has not made a substantial difference, “it does make me feel more secure.”

20210205,Tufts Medical Center talks COVID-19 vaccine efficacy & roll-out,"About a year since the first outbreak of the coronavirus, vaccines countering the virus have finally begun rolling out. However, there has been a lot of confusion and concern about the efficacy of the vaccine and the method in which it is available to the public. 
Sampan had the opportunity to interview Dr. Helen Boucher, Chief of Infectious Diseases at Tufts Medical Center (TMC) to address some of these concerns. Dr. Boucher has been at the frontlines in managing responses to the COVID-19 epidemic at TMC. Dr. Deeb Salem, Physician in Chief of the Department of Medicine at TMC says of Dr. Boucher, “she probably knows more about COVID-19 than anybody I’ve ever met.”
In Massachusetts, the vaccine distribution plan begins with healthcare workers and caretakers. The second phase started February 1, opening to individuals 75 and older and high-risk patients. Dr. Boucher said, “we’re starting what they’re calling a ‘pilot’ of high-risk patients … we will enter phase 2, persons aged 75 and over being eligible for vaccination.” The full list of phases and eligibility can be found on the mass.gov website.
“For Massachusetts, these are the rules, and we think that if our caregivers go down, then who is gonna take care of the people doing this? But then again, it’s the governor’s choice, and we’re very careful,” Dr. Salem said. 
To combat misinformation, Tufts Medical Center has taken a proactive stance in maintaining communications with the local Chinatown Community. Dr. Boucher said, “we’ve been meeting with the Chinatown community with Councilor Flynn regularly throughout the whole epidemic.” Additionally, they have also released a list of 20 Q&As about the vaccine, which can be found on Sampan’s website in both English and Chinese. 
One of the most important questions addressed is the effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccine. Every year, the flu vaccine is only 50-60% effective, depending on the year. “So we have two vaccines that were studied, and over 44,000 and over 30-some odd thousand each. One is 95% effective, and one is 94.5% effective in preventing COVID disease,” said Dr. Boucher. “That’s much higher than we expected.” 
The COVID-19 vaccine is immunogenic. This means that they are dead viruses injected into your body to mount an immune response. “So that you’ll be able to fight off the virus if you encounter it. And that does cause some side effects. So that causes a sore arm, and it causes things for some folks, fatigue, malaise, and a low fever that can last 1-3 days. So you might feel crummy for 1-3 days. And it’s a little more than a flu shot,” said Dr. Boucher. “As we get more data from millions vaccinated now, we’re even more reassured that these side effects are mild and manageable.”
“The thing that makes us fairly comfortable about this is that it’s not a live vaccine. For example, smallpox was a live vaccine,” Dr. Salem adds. And smallpox has been eradicated. “If I thought that something was dangerous [about the COVID-19 vaccine], I would not be the first to get it,” he said.
According to Dr. Boucher, the vaccine roll-out’s biggest challenge is the supply. It’s still unclear how much supply there actually is, making planning the timeline of phases very difficult. The currently available vaccines require two doses per individual, making it even more challenging to track and calculate the supply. Dr. Boucher said, “The supply is not totally clear, and we still just have the two MRNA vaccines. We’re hopeful that we’ll have another vaccine in the next, maybe month or so. The J&J (Johnson & Johnson) vaccine is likely the next one to come, and that one is only a one-dose vaccine, and it doesn’t require those fancy freezers for storage. So that could really be a game changer, in terms of getting to the community more easily.”

20210205,Restaurants foresee business challenges for Chinese New Year,"Restaurants in Chinatown and beyond anticipate that this year’s Chinese New Year will be different from past celebrations. While business owners said they believe people will still find ways to keep the spirit alive, many spaces whose banquets bring in a significant amount of revenue will be cutting back on the festivities. The holiday will mostly be honored at home, owners said.
“We haven’t been prepping in the sense that we have in the past, because of COVID and the limited capacity that’s legally mandated by the City of Boston,” said Patty Moy, manager of China Pearl in Chinatown. “I don’t believe that we will be doing any indoor festivities.” She added, “Banquet-wise, it’s definitely nonexistent. We don’t have any of those. No pre-bookings, nothing.”
At China Pearl, there will be limited indoor seating, with a ninety-minute time frame for visitors to stay, in order to help with traffic flow, said Moy. There is no specific menu set in stone, but if customers call in in advance to make a special order, they can be accommodated. Moy said that she anticipates that many people will stay home and order takeout to ring in the New Year. While Feb. 12 marks an occasion when celebrations will have to be unlike past years, Moy said that the hardships have been going on ever since the pandemic hit.
“It’s already difficult,” said Moy. “We were already affected since COVID, since mid-March 2020. It’s been difficult because all banquets have been canceled. Never mind Chinese New Year – it’s all the same. We’re taking things day by day. How we do today is dependent on whether or not we can be open the next day. …For us, we’re really dependent on weekends. The rest of the days, Chinatown is just dead. There’s no one out there.” Moy added that the restaurant, hanging by a thread, has tried to employ every idea they can think of, including delivery, takeout, and outdoor seating options.
Meanwhile, for Sumiao Hunan Kitchen in Kendall, the restaurant will be holding indoor seating for Chinese New Year and will also feature a special menu. Owner Sumiao Chen said that she thinks many families will engage in virtual parties, while there will be fewer people at the eatery than usual. This past year, revenue has gone down by a third, according to Chen. Now, 90% of sales come from takeout, and only 10% come from dining in. This change starkly contrasts pre-pandemic conditions, when the restaurant saw 80% of sales come from dining in and 20% from takeout. The coronavirus has made work very stressful, said Chen.
“Safety becomes a major concern and the highest priority,” said Chen. “We are only able to open at a quarter of the capacity. At the same time, we would like to retain our employees, as many as we can. [There’s] food costs and additional PPE. Sales have dropped down, while at the same time, the cost of ingredients have increased, due to the pandemic.  It’s hard to find staff who will feel safe to come back to work, so we have to pay more.  Costs are extremely higher than before the pandemic.” 
Yong Yong Restaurant in Malden has also been navigating this difficult time. According to owner Yong Xie, the dining space will not have a Chinese New Year special menu and will most likely be takeout only. This decision was partly made because the restaurant lost over half of its employees over the past year, said Xie. Many staff members were anxious about the risk of coming in to work, and Xie said that Yong Yong did not have enough business to cover paying the workers. Xie said that it is possible that after Chinese New Year, the restaurant may have to close for some time and reopen at the end of spring or early summer.
Ronnie Tow, a Medford resident who grew up in Chinatown, said that he believes this upcoming Chinese New Year will be less public and see fewer groupings. However, he maintains that the culinary scene is an important part of life in neighborhoods like Chinatown.
“Food was always, and still is for many cultures, a bonding [experience],” said Tow. “…Many of the restaurants bring back those great memories, bring back those flavors, those smells. Many of the restaurants have different types of food from different provinces. …It’s definitely a way to bring back memories and connect with your own culture. Food is powerful.”

20210122,"Thank You, Boston","By Mayor Martin J. Walsh
On January 12, I held my final State of the City, which was broadcast live from Boston’s newest civic treasure, the completely rebuilt Roxbury branch of the Boston Public Library in Nubian Square. 
2020 was a tough year. 2021 is a year for healing as we keep each other safe; get through this final stretch of the pandemic; and build a recovery that moves all our neighborhoods forward. 
Since the COVID-19 pandemic began, we have lost 1,077 Bostonians to COVID-19. They are loved and missed and their families are in my heart. COVID has affected all of us and it has hit some harder than others. Black, Latino, and immigrant communities faced the biggest impacts. Inequities in health, housing, and work opportunities caused more illness and job loss in these communities. Older Bostonians and those with disabilities face the highest risk and the most isolation. Most students have been out of classrooms since March, and families have struggled with childcare. 
While 2020 was a year of struggle, it was also a year that brought out the best in our city. We saw nurses, doctors, and medical staff gearing up and going into battle to save lives and provide comfort. We saw EMTs on the frontlines of a pandemic, helping over 4,000 COVID-19 patients. Firefighters brought recovery coaches to calls, to help those struggling with addiction. Police officers took 800 guns off the street, keeping us safe no matter the risk. Essential workers and City employees answered the call, day after day. Residents stepped up to help each other in a thousand different ways. The heroes are all around us.
As a City, we came together. We built a field hospital in five days. We created a Health Inequities Task Force to address health disparities across race and ethnicity. We’ve provided over six million meals to children, families, veterans, and seniors. We got 40,000 laptops to students. We got permanent rental vouchers to over 1,000 families with children at risk of homelessness. And, we created the Boston Resiliency Fund, providing over $30 million to help 250,000 households in need. And in 2020, despite the pandemic, we approved $8.5 billion of new investment in our city, creating a potential 35,000 new jobs. 
In 2021, we will continue that work. One of our next priorities is getting students safely back into Boston Public Schools. We will also continue to support small businesses, renters and homeowners, and those in recovery; push even further towards meeting our climate goals; and invest in Boston’s parks and civic spaces that give our residents more opportunities to come together, safely. 
We also need to address all the ways systemic racism hurts people in our city. The urgency of this work has never been more clear. Last summer, George Floyd’s murder sparked a long-overdue reckoning with racism. I thank Black Bostonians for the way you made your voices heard. And I thank everyone who joined the movement — Black, white, Latino, Asian, and indigenous peoples standing together. I’m asking all of us to accept this responsibility as our own and commit to fighting racism. It’s our deepest moral obligation – and it’s our greatest opportunity for growth.
We have tough days ahead of us. But we’ve been knocked down before, and we always get back up. In 2021, Boston will rise up again. We will leave no one behind, and our city will be stronger than ever.
As you might know, President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris have nominated me to be Labor Secretary in their administration. I have accepted this honor. If confirmed by the US Senate, I’m not going to Washington alone. I’m bringing Boston with me. This city is not just my hometown, it’s my heart. I believe in Boston. This is the city that welcomed my immigrant parents. This is the city that picked me up when I needed a second chance. This is the city where I fought side by side with you for marriage equality, immigrant rights, addiction treatment, criminal justice reform, education funding, and good middle-class jobs. 
Every minute of every day in this job, I spent listening to you, learning from you, working with you and working for you. I will never forget it, and I will forever be grateful.  We may be hurting now, but the state of our city is resilient; the state of our city is united; the state of our city is hopeful; and the state of our city is deep-down Boston strong. 
Boston, thank you.

20210122,A Boston origin of… duck sauce?,"If you dine at local Chinese restaurants, you’ve probably been served a container of duck sauce, a versatile sweet and sour sauce that is commonly used for dipping fried foods, from eggrolls to chicken fingers, fried wontons to crab rangoons. It has become such a familiar sauce that you can find it at non-Chinese restaurants too, especially with an order of chicken fingers. 
What is the origin of this curious sauce? 
Theories abound about its origin, most believing it acquired its name in the U.S., and that it may be a renamed or variation of plum or hoisin sauce. It was likely called ‘duck sauce’ in the U.S. because the sauce was originally a Chinese accompaniment for duck. My own research into its origins has been enlightening, especially as there may be a Boston connection.
It’s fascinating that the first documented reference I found concerning Chinese duck sauce was in the Boston Herald, January 15, 1927. The paper mentioned a dinner at an unnamed Chinese restaurant on Hudson Street which served “sauces of soy, sauces of mustard and duck sauce.” Did the term duck sauce thus originate in Boston and spread from there? Unfortunately, the article didn’t provide any details on the nature of this duck sauce. 
Hoisin sauce is commonly used with Peking Duck, but it doesn’t seem a likely candidate for being duck sauce. From my piece on a prior history of Peking Duck, we know that Peking Duck was a rarity in the U.S. during the 1920s. It wasn’t until 1958 that the first Chinese restaurant in the Boston area served Peking Duck. So, it makes no sense that the duck sauce mentioned in Boston had anything to do with Peking duck. 
The Cantonese had their own version of roast duck, and it was served in American restaurants, including in Boston’s Chinatown, at least as far back as the late 19th century. Plum sauce was used with Cantonese duck, so it seems a far more likely candidate for duck sauce than hoisin sauce. 
In general, plum sauce was made from plums, sugar, vinegar, salt, and ginger but there were acceptable variations, which might include other fruits, like apricots, as well as garlic, soy sauce or other items. American Chinese restaurants might have purchased plum sauce from Chinese grocery stores, or they might have made their own. ‘Duck sauce’ could easily be a variation of plum sauce. 
The next reference to duck sauce didn’t appear until over 11 years later, in the Brooklyn Daily Eagle (NY), September 19, 1938, which noted that Chinese foods were becoming popular. The article stated that “...another favored dish is barbecued roast pork in duck sauce served with white meat chicken balls, dipped in rice flour batter and fried with black and white mushrooms, pimientos, bamboo sprouts and water chestnuts.” Duck sauce with roast pork? 
Although plum sauce was used with roast duck, it wasn’t restricted to that use. The Chinese also used plum sauce with roast meats, such as pork, and that obviously carried through in their American restaurants. In fact, in many later American newspaper references, duck sauce was more often mentioned in connection with roast or barbecued pork than with duck. It actually wouldn’t have surprised me if duck sauce had been called ‘pork sauce’ instead, as Americans were using it for pork far more than duck. 
With the first documented reference to ‘duck sauce’ in 1927 in Boston, and the next reference not appearing until 11 years later, it’s easy to believe the term had spread from Boston to New York during that lengthy period. It may only be circumstantial evidence, but it is persuasive in some respects, especially as there isn’t any evidence to the contrary. . 
During the 1940s, duck sauce started becoming mentioned a bit more in various newspapers and books. As I mentioned previously, it was being used primarily for other foods, like pork or egg rolls, rather than duck. It wouldn’t be until the second half of the 1940s that a few duck sauce references arose in regions outside of Massachusetts and New York. In the 1950s, mentions of duck sauce seemed to explode across the country. 
The first newspaper recipe for Duck Sauce also apparently appeared in the Boston Globe, February 6, 1952. The ingredients included consomme, onion, green pepper, mushroom, tomato, vinegar, sugar, soy sauce, ginger root, and broth. It was also mentioned that the Chinese serve duck sauce at their restaurants with pork or barbecued spareribs, but there was no mention of duck. 
Later that year, another, and very different, recipe was provided in the Boston Traveler, September 9, 1952, for “Plum or Duck Sauce.” The ingredients were very different from the earlier Boston Globe recipe. The ingredients included 1 cup plum jelly, ½ cup chutney, 1 tablespoon vinegar; and 1 tablespoon of sugar. It was said to be served with egg rolls, shrimp, lobster, barbecued spareribs, and Chinese roast pork. 
We may have more clarity on the origins of duck sauce, but a definitive answer is still elusive. It seems that duck sauce is probably another term for plum sauce, and was used at least as far back as 1927. Plus, it’s possible that the first use of the term duck sauce may have originated in Boston’s Chinatown, in the 1920s, and spread across the East Coast and then westward. Duck sauce remains as popular as it ever has been, and it would be fascinating if Boston’s Chinatown played a part in its creation.

20210122,BPS Panel on concerns of the AAPI community,"Councilor Ed Flynn hosted a panel discussion with Superintendent Brenda Cassellius to address the concerns with the immigrant Asian American Pacific Islander (AAPI) community in regards to Boston Public Schools (BPS). This discussion provided a long-awaited platform for AAPI educators to express their concerns while sharing their vision for an inclusive and anti-racist education structure. 
Given the Boston AAPI community’s long history of being silenced and unheard within the system, Ed Flynn, District 2 councilor, reasserted that, “our Asian community is diverse and resilient, it deserves to be heard and respected.” 
Educators who spoke at the meeting came from all backgrounds, reminding us that AAPI concerns are diverse and not homogenous. Topics brought up ranged from bilingual teachers, to Sheltered English Immersion classes, to mental health. There was a common call for more efficient and effective communication that caters to immigrant families who are oftentimes the last ones to hear about urgent and important news. 
Translation and interpretation was one of the greatest concerns held by all educators. Mei Yu, a Sheltered English Immersion (SEI) teacher from Josiah Quincy Elementary School, remarked that BPS needed to take interpretation more seriously by hiring high quality tutors. “When I go into Individual Education Program (IEP) meetings with parents, the interpreters are unable to articulate the parent’s concerns and this reflects unfairly on the students,” said Yu. 
Tuyet Dinh, an SEI K2 teacher for the Mather Elementary School, also commented on the urgent need for Vietnamese translation, calling for a full-time Vietnamese interpreter to work within BPS’s central office. “These interpreters should have knowledge with how BPS operates and who are familiar with the educational terminology,” said Dinh. 
Equity and community engagement were also important issues discussed. In particular, parents were frustrated by the representation of the exam school task force. They asked if parents from different AAPI communities and parents of children with learning disabilities could be considered if BPS is deciding to formulate a longer-term exam school policy. Parents also hope that Boston Latin School can follow the IEP guidelines to better support non-English speaking parents and students, asking that they do not relocate these students to different schools. “These non-english speaking parents feel helpless, and I hope that BPS can treat this seriously,” Yu said. 
Katie Li, representing the Massachusetts Asian American Educators Association (MAAEA), cinched off the panel meetings with actionable long and short term steps and changes that the administration could adopt. These include funding ethnic and Asian American studies, creating an AAPI stakeholder group, and addressing the social and emotional health and wellbeing of AAPI students. 
“Much of the way Asian American racialization becomes internal. We are racialized in society to be erased and insibilized and not to have voice and keep our place. That has major effects on our students who do not feel well at the mental and emotional level,” Li stresses. 
Brenda Cassellius and her team responded that they are working on these short and long term goals which MAAEA had stated along with the equity team. Silvia Romero-Johnson, the assistant superintendent for the Office of English Learners closes off the meeting reassuring everyone that “[they] are working on developing a plan that will take the next three to five years on how we imagine services for English learners.”

20210122,"First of MBTA service cuts, reduced weekend train service, to start Jan. 23","Weekend train service will be slashed for all but five commuter rail lines as part of the first MBTA service cuts to go into effect next week. 
Beginning Jan. 23, the commuter rail will only offer weekend service on the Newburyport/Rockport, Framingham/Worcester, Fairmount, Providence, and Middleborough lines. Trains will be added to the Middleborough, Fairmount, and Newburyport/Rockport lines to fill in previous service gaps and maintain more consistent train intervals.
The service cuts were approved last month by the MBTA’s Fiscal and Management Control Board, following backlash from several advocacy groups and the public. An earlier version of the service cuts was first presented in November as part of the MBTA’s Forging Ahead proposal, which was rolled out to address lower ridership during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The MBTA projected a budget deficit of $580 million for its next fiscal year, according to assistant general manager for policy Laurel Paget-Seekins. She said that although the MBTA has been working on controlling their costs for years now, there were no plans to implement service cuts before the pandemic, only ones to add services. 
“The budget deficit comes from lost fare revenue due to ridership going down primarily and also our parking revenue from the parking lot and our advertising revenues because that’s based on equal movement in the systems. So it’s based on the pandemic,” Paget-Seekins told Sampan. Fare revenue composed 40% of their pre-pandemic funding, she said. 
Following their initial Forging Ahead proposal, the MBTA spent a month collecting public feedback over 10 meetings and one hearing. A MassINC poll of Massachusetts residents found that 64% of respondents opposed the original “forging ahead” service cuts. The feedback from those sessions led the MBTA to reverse course on some of its previously proposed changes — suspending fewer bus routes, maintaining partial ferry and weekend commuter rail service, and continuing to run bus and subways until 1 a.m. 
According to the MBTA’s implementation timeline, service cuts will start in January for the commuter rail and ferry, and March for the bus and subways.
Still, transit activists within the Transportation for Massachusetts and Transit is Essential coalitions believe the modifications are insufficient. Stacy Thompson, executive director of LivableStreets Alliance, which is part of both coalitions, fears the cuts will have an outsized impact on people who need the public transit system the most right now. She said many unknowns still exist in service cuts as they stand, pointing out that it remains unclear how much money the T will save.
“Even if a limited number of riders, the people who are riding transit right now need it. They’re individuals who have no other option,” Thompson said. 
MBTA partnership director Josh Ostroff echoed Thompson’s sentiments in an email statement, “The agency is still serving essential workers such as doctors, nurses, and other health care professionals, as well as people making essential trips to grocery stores and medical appointments.”
Angela D. Johnson-Rodriguez, statewide organizing director for Transportation for Massachusetts, said, “If the campaign succeeds, this will be a signal to Massachusetts residents that the MBTA is listening to the needs of its most vulnerable riders. It will also be a signal towards preserving the future of our economic landscape.” 
“Public transit is a public good,” Jim Evers, president of the Boston Carmen’s Union, Local 589, said in an interview with Sampan. “I just think it’s premature of what they have done prior to getting some of these federal monies and waiting on maybe some other alternative funding from the legislature as well.”
Paget-Seekins added that the MBTA is thinking of the service cuts in terms of a two-year budget. Their board plans to save as much money as possible this year to place into reserve funds for next year’s anticipated gap in ridership. 
The problem, said Evers, is that “if they want to reimplement some schedules that they cut the service to, they have to rehire, retrain, and go through a rigorous medical process. The costs that are associated to it with unemployment are huge and never mind the timing. The timing would take months and months.” A second challenge with reimplementing a line is that there is no way to measure future demand.
“That’s if they’ll even reimplement the service at all,” he added. “We’ve seen it in the past. They’ve cut the routes and service and never reimplemented it back into the communities.” Johnson-Rodriguez explained that to certain communities who depend on the transportation services, “This decision will reverberate for at least a generation, if not more because this is not just about physically cutting service, it’s also about severing trust. And often, like service, trust never returns. 
The MBTA plans to use public input gathered in November when determining how to proceed with future funds. “The other thing we’ve been asking in the community outreach is as revenue comes back, whether it is through fares, or it’s through additional revenue from the federal government, how should we prioritize adding service back of the things that we’re proposing to cut?” Paget-Seekins said. 
On Jan. 6, state lawmakers approved a $16.5 billion transportation bond bill that Gov. Charlie Baker signed into law on Friday, Jan. 16. Before signing, Baker vetoed a proposed increase in service fees for rideshare services like Uber and Lyft. Those generated funds would have been reinvested into public transportation programs. 
Additionally, the original bill required the MBTA to implement a low-income fare program, which Baker also removed, calling the provision premature.
“More study is needed to understand how transit authorities can implement fare systems that depend on gathering information about riders’ incomes and to understand what the revenue loss would be and how that revenue would be replaced,” Baker said. “No means-tested fares can be implemented until the MBTA and RTAs have a financially sustainable plan in place to replace the lost revenue.”
The program, which would have established fares based on the rider’s income level, has long been a priority of transit advocates. In an interview before the bill’s signing, Evers expressed hope that the governor would be mindful of not cutting out certain line items: raising fees on Uber and Lyft rides, establishing means-tested fares on public transit and decriminalizing fare evasion on the MBTA. 
When searching for a sustainable, long-term funding solution to the T’s budget shortfalls, it is important to focus attention on the state legislature to increase funding to the MBTA in addition to focusing on the MBTA’s board, Thompson said. 
For transportation activists, a major area of long-term concern is that T officials said the cuts could ultimately include employee layoffs. Paget-Seekins confirmed this possibility. “We are working with our unions to try to figure out the best way to make sure that our employees are, again, impacted the least amount,” she said. “We’re hoping that we’re being sort of as transparent as we can with everyone about how we’re making a decision.”
Evers has not heard of any layoffs from Local 589, which represents over 6,000 transportation professionals, as of yet. He said, “My union is open to negotiations and more than willing to do anything we can to help the riders be able to get back on their feet and get the service up and running.”
As of now, the long-term outlook remains unclear, and officials plan to push off discussing whether to keep cuts in place, expand them or reverse them until February, when the MBTA begins to plan its fiscal 2022 budget.

20210108,Boston launches Community Choice Electricity program,"As a step working towards Boston Mayor Walsh’s goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050, Boston is set to launch the Community Choice Electricity program (CCE). All Boston residents will be automatically enrolled in the program in February 2021, unless they choose to opt-out. 
“Through the program, the city of Boston can pull the collective buying power of Boston’s residents and businesses to negotiate favorable electric contracts with electricity suppliers,” said Aidan Smith, CCE Outreach Coordinator on the Dec. 21 webinar to inform the audience about the program. “The city does this on behalf of the program’s customers so as to provide the most affordable and renewable electricity possible.” Since Dec. 14, the city has hosted webinars in a row in multiple languages to spread the program’s logistics to local communities. 
Here is Sampan’s rundown on how it works: In general, Eversource is Boston’s local utility service for residents to receive electricity. Eversource owns and maintains the poles and wires to distribute electricity within the city. It is only from the delivery of the electricity that Eversource gets its revenue, not from the actual supply. Electricity suppliers could be Eversource itself, through which customers are receiving ‘basic service.’ Customers can also sign a contract with a private third-party company to get electricity supply. 
The newly introduced program plays an intermediary role between the electricity supplier and its delivery. As an alternative option, CCE will select an electric supplier to provide electricity to customers, and Eversource basic service will no longer be the default option.
Eversource will continue to deliver electricity, maintain the grid, and provide customer service and billing. Participants of the program would only see the change on the electric supply portion of the bill. 
The city has selected Constellation NewEnergy, Inc. (“Constellation”) as the electricity supplier for the program and its customers for the time between February, 2021 and November, 2021. The program will not necessarily stick to the same electricity supplier after this period, according to its official website. 
Constellation will offer customers three options. Boston residents will be automatically enrolled in the CCE program and register for its Standard Product. Other than this default option, customers can either “opt down” to “Optional Basic,” or “opt up” to “Optional Green 100.” The three options differ on the cost and the percentage of renewable electricity. 
Over a period of time, CCE plans to bring in more renewable sources of energy and may be cheaper. But it is not guaranteed that CCE will always be cheaper than Eversource’s basic service. “The reason for this is that Eversource’s rates will change on July 1st, 2021. And we don’t know what their new rates will be,” Smith said. 
Customers can join in, opt out or change the program product at any time without penalty, and there is no contract to sign, Smith stressed on the webinar. 
There are three ways to opt-out of the program — you can call Constellation’s phone number (833) 930-3161 or go to the website or reply to the card mailed to your home in December. You can also choose to opt in by calling or going through the website. 
“The transition will be entirely seamless. However, we don’t want the seamlessness of this transition to mask the importance of this program,” Smith said. “The impact of a whole city collectively making this small shift is enormous. It will provide the city with a key lever for addressing our collective economic, environmental, and climate change goals.”

20201218,Chinatown addresses relationship building with Tufts,"Boston Chinatown community leaders addressed resilience among Chinese immigrants through difficult times in a webinar hosted by Tufts University faculty on Dec 4. The webinar, titled Voices from Chinatown: Resilience in the Time of COVID-19 and Anti-Asian Racism, also proposed suggestions for Chinatown to build a harmonious relationship as a host neighborhood with Tufts University.
Like other Chinatowns in the U.S, the Boston Chinatown has had a long history of trauma — from the urban renewal projects displacing families and businesses with highway construction and institutional expansion starting from the 1950s to ongoing gentrification expelling low-income residents to this year’s pandemic and the wave of anti-Asian racism. However, on this webinar, speakers focused on how the community has survived as a fighter, rather than a victim, and ways it can continue flourishing.
“For my 10 years of working in Chinatown, the narrative that I want to paint, which is what I teach my students, is that Chinatown is a resilient community,” said Carolyn L. Rubin, assistant professor at Tufts University School of Medicine. “We have always struggled, and we have always resisted.” Rubin served as the moderator of the webinar.
We still see ongoing displacement in Boston Chinatown, said Jeena Hah, Program Manager at Asian Community Development Corporation (ACDC). She mentioned how a dim-sum restaurant where “everybody knows someone who got married there” is slated to be taken over by an office complex.
“How can we continue to push back on this narrative that we don’t belong if you are too immigrant or too poor in Chinatown?” Hah asked.
For those who cannot afford to live in Chinatown, they still come back to Chinatown to receive services such as family services, adult education, medical services, said Panelist Yoyo Yau, Director of Programs at Boston Chinatown Neighborhood Center (BCNC). She challenged the audience to think of Chinatown as a community beyond geographic locations.
Furthermore, Yau expressed BCNC’s need for support from Tufts University. BCNC could utilize knowledge, material, and people resources from the school to serve those in need among multiple programs better, she said.
Panelist Chu Huang, Co-Chair of Boston Chinatown Resident Association (CRA), echoed this concern and advocated for more meaningful connections between the community and the institution.
“There’s a lot of amazing community nonprofits, resources in Chinatown, a lot of great uniqueness and character to it,” she said. “But I also hope that there will be individual connections, community connections that are very enriching and meaningful, that can reach towards longer-term impact for good, and it’s really important that we develop trust-building in these relationships.”
For those in Tufts University who make decisions concerning Chinatown, “I really do hope that our most vulnerable residents are kept in mind,” Huang said. She encouraged people to confront the discomfort in having constructive and productive conversations. “We must be brave. We must be bold to work together in reaching where we want to be together,” she said.
Rubin forwarded the concept of “dirty pain” and “clean pain” coined by Resmaa Menakem in his 2017 book. “Clean pain is what you experience when you have no idea what to do when you’re scared or worried about what might happen, and when you step forward into the unknown with honesty and vulnerability,” she said.
There is no roadmap for Tufts University or Chinatown in building collaboration and relationships, but “that speaks to the courage, the creativity, the compassion, the community, all of that — that you guys [have] as community experts, as organic intellectuals,” Rubin said.
There are people in Tufts University who would like to share resources, and when they have conversations with Chinatown, they need to look to Chinatown members as experts on subject matters, Rubin later told Sampan.
“We need to work in a true collective spirit, and we need to all lean into our growing edge. All of us have a growing edge,” she said on the webinar.

20201218,Digital divide widens for minorities and women with virtual pandemic hiring practices,"As hiring practices adapt during the pandemic, the turn towards virtual interviews and skills assessments has exacerbated the accessibility barriers that low-income and minority applicants face. A survey conducted by job listings website Indeed.com found that out of 500 employers across 16 sectors and 12 cities, more than four in five employers have started virtual hiring during the pandemic. Yet, far fewer, 26%, found the virtual hiring process effective, with 22% believing the shift was the right way forward, while acknowledging present challenges.
The companies hiring amid record national-wide levels of unemployment and layoffs lie mostly in the transportation and warehousing, professional and business services, health care, manufacturing, financial activities, leisure and hospitality, and construction industries, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistic’s Employment Situation Summary for November. Historically, many of these industries pull from an applicant pool that may face challenges such as a lack of distraction-free space and limited access to technology.
Asian American Civic Association’s Careers in Banking and Finance program witnessed several cases where an applicant couldn’t go through with a virtual interview, not because of their qualifications, but because of accessibility. “This pandemic, in terms of hiring, really left out a lot of moms or parents with younger kids,” said Robin Wood, CBF program manager at the time. “If you have a house full of kids and only one computer, how are you going to take a Zoom interview when someone is in second grade at the same time?”
Wood added that single parents, people in homeless shelters, and those who previously relied on library computers or borrowed devices experienced extreme difficulty. She explained that applicants might only have access to a cellphone — hindering their ability to search for a job, update and send a resume, and participate in a virtual interview.
A WayUp survey of college students and recent graduates indicated that minority candidates are significantly more worried about having the appropriate setup at home for virtual interviewing and work. In particular, Black and Hispanic are 145% more likely to feel concerned about whether they are capable of doing a job remotely than White candidates.
Female candidates were 70% more likely than male ones to cite having the right technology and resources as one of the most concerning features of remote work. This, in combination with women taking on more homeschooling and childbearing duties after daycare and school closures, may be why the percentage of women successfully getting hired fell in lockdown, while that of men rose. A National Women’s Law Center analysis revealed that in September, women gained about 2 in 5 of the jobs added to the economy, although they make up about half of the workforce.
Inequality within access to the tools necessary to effectively interview remotely carries over to other parts of the applicant selection process, namely skills assessment tests. Though skills tests were commonly used in the hiring process long before the pandemic, employers rely on and valuing them more in a virtual environment. Many employers ask their applicants to take one, aiming to narrow down candidates post-interview or when deciding who to interview in the first place. According to Wood, such assessments tend to be lengthy, full of double-negatives, and words and phrases that may not be familiar to candidates who speak English as a second language.
Language and technological barriers are likely to intensify as data suggests virtual shifts in hiring practices are here to stay. “Companies will be hiring for people who can go remotely, and do have the technological skills to go remotely because they were caught off guard when they had to send everybody home with laptops,” Wood said.
Recruiters have already begun heavily testing and investing in technologies to help them evolve towards an increasingly automated and digitalized applicant screening process. Research by JobVite showed that 58% of over 200 recruiters across industries are now using social media networks, like LinkedIn, Facebook and Instagram, to recruit and connect with potential hires. Text messaging, chatbots, and AI are also growing more popular for communicating and updating candidates throughout the hiring process.
Most recently, companies have turned towards interviews without a human interviewer, asking job applicants to video record answers to set questions instead. These may be accompanied by personality tests or games, which are also conducted virtually, to gauge applicants’ personal qualities.
Kimberly Reingold, director of external communications at Fidelity Investments, said that over the last ten months, they’ve changed their hiring process to include “interviews via video, and positions that include flexible schedules, remote learning and training, and work from home.” Their onboarding process was also primarily digital, though they offered shipping of laptops and other equipment and remote access to technology services for set-up and questions.
The new technologies are used most frequently to evaluate candidates applying to high-turnover hourly jobs, such as fast-food workers, phone representatives or warehouse employees, according to the New York Times. In these cases, internet connection issues or inexperience with the recording technology may be an automatic disqualifier — demonstrating that familiarity with technology is needed on top of access.

20201218,COVID-19 economy suggests long term implications on job market,"The job market has steadily been stabilizing after a sharp decline in March and April due to COVID-19. Additionally, the stock market is at an all-time high despite America currently undergoing its largest COVID-19 spike since the beginning of the pandemic.
According to the U. S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, after nonfarm jobs fell by 20.5 million in April, beginning in May, jobs have been steadily rising. From May to November, employment has risen by about 12 million.
In regards to unemployment, “The rate is down by 8.0 percentage points from its recent high in April but is 3.2 percentage points higher than it was in February,” wrote the November economic news release from the U. S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Although jobs have slowly been making their way back to pre-pandemic levels, this recent report indicates that overall, the job market hasn’t fully recovered.
Levels of employment, for example, depend on the type of industry a job is in.
In March, jobs in leisure and hospitality were hit the hardest with about 495,000 jobs lost. In April, leisure and hospitality still led with about 7.6 million jobs lost. Comparatively, the industry with the second-highest amount of jobs lost was retail trade, at about 2.3 million jobs.
In April, every job industry experienced a decline in jobs, but starting from May, most industries began to recover with the notable exception of government jobs, which fell by 585,000.
As of the most recent job report, most sectors are continuing to see job growth — the only exceptions are jobs in retail trade, utilities, and government industries.
Although jobs have not yet fully stabilized, the stock market has recently surged upward.
One possible reason for this could be because the stock market heavily skews towards how the tech industry is doing, said Laurence Kotlikoff, professor of economics at Boston University.
“More people are buying from Amazon, for example,” Kotlikoff said. “If you look at the stock market in general … most [firms] have gone down in value. So, we’re getting a very skewed picture.”
Another possible reason for the stock market’s success could be because the Federal Reserve System has “strongly and directly” supported the market.
“[The Fed is] directly supporting the stock market by buying up shares but indirectly by guaranteeing companies debts — either explicitly or implicitly — that’s had an impact on the stock market,” Kotlikoff said.
Kotlikoff also said he believes that, thanks to COVID-19, the job market will look considerably different in the future. Cities in particular will “be looking for long term trouble” because companies will have less reason to buy physical real estate after the success of work-from-home procedures.
“I think you’re going to have some desire to get back and socialize, but I think there’s gonna be a lot more remote work and less business travel — you’re already seeing these layoffs in the airline industry,” Kotlikoff said. “This is reflecting a long term trend.”
COVID-19’s impacts on the job market, Kotlikoff said, also comes with implications for the future of cities.
“You have companies not engaging in so much travel, not renting office space — that means cities are going to be hollowed out,” Kotlikoff said. “That means rental real estate is going to take a hit in the cities. That means the real estate companies — unless the Fed bails them out or continues to — they’re going to go under.”
Kotlikoff said malls and other retail stores would be hit hardest by the aftermath of COVID-19, particularly because some large clothing retailers — such as J.Crew — have already “gone under.”
“The malls are going to be suffering because the large stores that anchored them are not going to be doing that in the future,” Kotlikoff said. “So, the malls may end up being warehouses for Amazon.”
Small businesses, such as boutiques or local restaurants, will likely decrease under COVID-19 as well, Kotlikoff said.
“This is going to have long term implications for where people work and live. I think you’ll see less appeal of the cities because they are harbingers of disease,” Kotlikoff said.
Besides the economic impacts, Kotlikoff said he believes that COVID-19 will have a profound impact on how people, particularly young adults, behave.
“This is going to have a sustained impact on people’s psychology. Everybody who grew up in the 30s, in the Great Depression … they came away with what was called a depression mentality,” Kotlikoff said. “Now we’re gonna have a COVID mentality that is not gonna go away.”

20201204,Greenway News,"By Rachel Lake
The Greenway Conservancy will bring new lighting improvements to Auntie Kay and Uncle Frank Chin Park and Mary Soo Hoo Park on The Greenway next spring, based on the community feedback and recommendations of the Chin Park Lighting Study. The Conservancy began the Chin Park Lighting Study in September 2019 with funding for the original design work provided by the Greenway Business Improvement District (BID).
The Conservancy, with its design team, solicited community feedback via an in-person Community Meeting with live translation in February 2020, followed by an online survey. In October 2020, the Conservancy hosted a virtual Community Update Meeting with live translation, where we provided an update on the priority projects for enhanced lighting. Additional community feedback came from the Chinatown Master Plan 2020, the Boston Planning and Development Agency PLAN Downtown initiative, the Harvard Graduate School of Design 2018 Chinatown 2020 Master Plan: A Health Lens Analysis, the Chinese Progressive Association 2017 Improving Health in Communities Near Highways: A Study of the Reggie Wong Park in Chinatown, and many ongoing stakeholder conversations. 
The community feedback has guided our project principles and design work:
Safety: The most consistent feedback we heard, and one of the main motivations for doing this project, is to increase safety throughout The Greenway in Chinatown. In order to make every area safe and inviting, we will prioritize lighting projects in the darkest spaces in the park. 
Activity: We also heard from the community that we should focus lighting enhancement projects on the most densely and diversely used areas of the park, namely the plaza. We will  prioritize lighting enhancements in this area to provide lighting support to the range of festivals and gatherings that happen on the plaza.
Aesthetics: We heard a call for lighting fixtures that reflect the culture of the community. We will begin this work by ensuring that existing cultural lighting elements are functioning properly and that planned lighting enhances and illuminates the existing Asian-inpsired design elements of Chin Park. We also see an opportunity to build off the success of our temporary public art by further exploring a unique, artist-inspired lighting infrastructure project on The Greenway in Chinatown.
Greenery: While not directly related to lighting, we have often heard a desire for more tree canopy for shade and air quality, and to soften the space by implementing more plantings in the areas with a lot of hardscape. . 
Based on this feedback, the Conservancy is actively fundraising for a first phase of projects in Spring 2021. So far, the Conservancy has successfully fundraised from the Massachusetts Cultural Facilities Fund and the Greenway BID, and has identified MassDOT Capital Repair funding. 
The following lighting projects are priorities, ideally for Spring 2021:
We will restore the Sampan Sail lights at the Essex Street Corner with new LED strip lights.
We hope to improve safety by adding light poles to the Serpentine Path. Poles will be installed along the eastern edge of the path, in the plant bed.
We hope to improve safety by adding catenary (string) lights to the south and east of the vent stack building in Mary Soo Hoo Park.
We hope to brighten the plaza by replacing the existing, and add additional, light poles. In addition, we plan to add new catenary lights above the plaza. 
Additionally, the Conservancy is pursuing the idea to add a new garden bed to the edge of the plaza. This garden bed would provide a buffer from the busy street and add trees and shade to the plaza, helping address the severe heat island effect in Chinatown. Located near the current BlueBikes station, it would provide additional seating near the PlayCubes and for events, while not interfering with the various cultural festivals held in the plaza. 
The Conservancy continues to actively fundraise for future lighting improvement projects, such as a community-inspired artistic lighting element and new lighting at the Essex Street Corner. Looking forward to this winter, the Conservancy will continue construction documentation and fundraising, leading to the procurement of a contractor and materials. This spring, we will begin construction on the first phase of lighting improvements. 
As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, we remind visitors to wear a face covering and practice appropriate physical distancing while on The Greenway. To learn more about The Greenway and work of the Greenway Conservancy, check out our website at rosekennedygreenway.org. Please feel free to reach out with any questions and concerns to info@rosekennedygreenway.org.

20201204,Chinatown residents push for community land use of Parcel R-1 at BPDA meeting,"After a series of ownership changes and soon returning to community use, Parcel R-1 faces many development expectations from the Boston Chinatown neighborhood. Parcel R-1 comprises 14 parcels located at 48–58 Tyler Street and 49–63 Hudson Street. The equaling 18,714 square feet of vacant land is now owned by BPDA while being used by Tufts University as a parking lot.
At the November 17 virtual meeting hosted by the Boston Planning & Development Agency (BPDA), team members illustrated their considerations and objectives on the site planning and received comments from Chinatown residents on their vision for R-1’s future development.
When Tufts University’s license agreement expired in 2017, an agreement was reached that the institution would give up its development rights in exchange for a year-by-year lease so that the land could be developed for community priorities, according to Lydia Lowe, Director of Chinatown Community Land Trust.
At the meeting, BPDA Senior Manager for Dispositions Reay Pannesi proposed their disposition objectives and goals towards the site development. BPDA is trying to upgrade the quality of life in Chinatown, and “ensure the long-term viability of Chinatown as a historic residential neighborhood, a unique cultural business and service center,” she said.
Their vision includes creating a high percentage of affordable housing on R-1, encouraging community business and trade, galvanizing employment opportunities for community residents, improving the environment through establishing open space subdistricts, and promoting public safety, health, and welfare of people.
In the feedback session, around 20 attendees made comments, asking questions about the project and talking about what they want to see in this community place-to-be.
The most resonated suggestions were on affordable housing, opening a library and green space. With the ongoing gentrification projects and rising housing prices, attendees reflected on how several of their neighbors have had to move out of Chinatown due to increasingly unaffordable rent.
Among the speakers were several high school and college students. They advocated for a library belonging to Chinatown – a place with free Wi-Fi for them to concentrate on studying, a public space for the community to gather and hold activities.
“I especially remember when I was younger, not being able to go to a library actually, because my working-class parents would not have time to bring me. And I noticed similar situations for my families who are currently living in the community,” said Sarah Wang, a Chinatown resident who has been living here for almost 24 years. “Also I’ve noticed living in the community is that there is really a lack of community space. I think we see this after school when we see kids just wandering along the streets, because there is really no space to sit down and hang out.”
She added that since the pandemic, she has seen people going to Parcel R-1 to exercise and take walks during nights when the parking lot was basically vacant. From that, we could see that the residents could really make use of this piece of land as a community space, she said.
Some attendees addressed the lack of green space in Chinatown, and cited high asthma rates among children studying and living in Chinatown.
“We want to hear from the community, what you would like to see for development guidelines, and also design guidelines,” Pannesi said at the meeting. “So we get feedback from you, and we put it into our RFP.”
After the meeting, the comment board on the BPDA website stayed open until December 2 to collect voice from the community. After the feedback receiving process, BPDA will hopefully issue the Project Request for Proposal in 2021 winter once gaining support from the community.

20201204,2020 election shows AAPI voters are active but complex,"By Christine Mui and Shira Laucharoen
Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) voters turned out in record numbers on a national level for the 2020 presidential election, according to data from Washington D.C. consulting firm Catalist with non-profit Asian and Pacific Islander Vote (APIA). During a press conference held by APIA, speakers stated that AAPI voters turned out early in battleground states at a rate of 21% more than the entire AAPI turnout of those states in 2016. That represents an overall 290% increase from 2016, ranging from 350% for ages 18-29 and 252% for 65 and older. Nationally, the rise in AAPI voter turnout from 2016 was 240%.
Although turnout from Asian Americans in Boston was at a high this year, representatives from the Chinese Progressive Association (CPA) said that Chinatown was relatively quiet on Election Day. Sophie Mark-Ng, an administrative staff member at CPA, saw a long line outside the Wang YMCA polling site at 7 a.m., but for the rest of the day, only a few people seemed to be trickling in. Paul Watanabe, director of the Institute for Asian American Studies at the University of Massachusetts Boston, said that this is most likely because many cast their votes by mail, in advance of November 3. He added that Chinatown has a substantial population of elderly people, who may have had difficulty going to the polls in person.
“This election is not like any other that we’ve had in this country or locally, where for in many places, the indications are that the majority of votes were cast either in advance of Election Day or by absentee ballot,” said Watanabe. “In a place like Chinatown, where the Asian American population tends to be older, it’s a wise thing that they had the option of voting by absentee ballot. And I think it may have helped contribute to an increased turnout.” 
The City of Boston Election Department’s data showed that as of midnight on election day, the voter turnout percentage for the wards and precincts that include Chinatown was 47.5% turnout for ward 3, precinct 8 and 46.8% for ward 5, precinct 1. Comparatively, the city’s total voter turnout percentage at that time was 39.43%. Barbara Delaney, civic engagement coordinator at the Boston Election Department, explained that the election department does not collect data on voters’ ethnic backgrounds, and these numbers may have some overlap with other neighborhoods. 
The Pew Research Center maintains that Asian Americans are the fastest growing group of eligible voters out of racial or ethnic groups in the United States electorate. While this population remains a powerful bloc, it is a complex one, as members are economically diverse and predominantly not registered under a particular party in Massachusetts.
According to Karen Chen, CPA executive director, the Asian American voting population is difficult to define in terms of party affiliation. While a majority voted for Joe Biden during the past election, Asian Americans frequently do not register for a particular party, choosing to be unenrolled. This may be because of unfamiliarity with the system or because they do not want to commit to one party or another, said Chen. She noted that they had seen increased efforts from the Republican Party to increase Asian American membership, while similar efforts were not observed from the Democratic Party.  
That tendency is not only specific to recent immigrants but holds true for people who have been in the country for a long time. Chen reported difficulties while helping a couple hundred people apply for voting by mail, mostly residents concentrated in Chinatown, Quincy, and Malden. “Even the application process was quite difficult,” she said. “With voter registration, some people had issues — your name has to be exactly like your driver’s license or Mass ID.” Such a requirement may create additional barriers for those who use their Chinese name on some forms of identification and an English one on others.
These barriers open opportunities for voter suppression. Even with translated ballots, the candidate names themselves may not be transliterated or represented in non-alphabetic characters for languages like Chinese and Arabic. In these cases, voters have to memorize the alphabetical spelling of their preferred candidates beforehand. “We had situations where for many years, the reason why we got bilingual ballots was that at the polling place, poll workers would tell people who to vote for. People don’t have the ability to vote independently when they don’t have a fully bilingual ballot,” Chen said. “Voter suppression is related to accessibility.”
Furthermore, APIA communities exhibit substantial socioeconomic disparities as the racial group with the largest wealth gap, which may affect the political issues that speak to them. These topical differences are reflected in geographical divisions. “If you look at Asian Americans who live in the suburban areas, how they look at racism or inequality issues is different. The need is different too,” said Chen. “People who live in the city would fight for access to services. Whereas I think suburban area folks would be like, well, I don’t need access. I want to be treated as American.” 
Working-class APIA voters, in particular, are a historically under-targeted group for public opinion and exit polling. “It’s always disappointing to see AAPI voters labeled ‘other,’” said Beth Huang, executive director at Massachusetts Voter Table.“Without this data, it’s difficult to gauge the ‘big picture’ public opinion of AAPIs. Our partner organizations in the Asian Pacific Islanders Civic Action Network were some of the only, if not the only, groups that contacted working-class AAPI voters in 2020.” She emphasized that “incentivizing civic engagement means empowering community leaders to reach out to less-likely voters in the languages that the voters speak and gives these voters a reason to cast their ballot.”
City Councilor Michelle Wu agreed that increased voter turnout and more Asian American representation in government are interrelated. She clarified, “I want to emphasize though that it’s not just that people vote based on their identity or their race or affiliation. My hope is that those candidates who are running for office are also being intentional and spending energy and resources in connecting the communities that they come from and communities that they want to represent in government.”
Nationally, the rise in AAPI voter turnout from 2016 was 240%.

20201120,"Our Voice, Our Land","by Lydia Lowe, Chinatown Community Land Trust
Boston Planning and Development Agency (BPDA, formerly called the Boston Redevelopment Authority) held a public meeting online on November 17 to discuss the future of Parcel R-1, the publicly owned lot between Tyler and Hudson Streets that is the former site of the old Chinatown YMCA. The meeting was held in English, Cantonese and Mandarin, and you can participate using a computer or tablet with internet access, or a cell phone.
Origins of Parcel R-1
The land known as Parcel R-1 was home to immigrant working class families, until its homes and stores were among hundreds of buildings that were razed during Urban Renewal.  While much of the urban renewal land was used to build the highways, some became part of the hospital campus, some was used to build replacement housing like Tai Tung Village and Mass Pike Towers, and Parcel R-1 remained in City hands. Other public land near Chinatown is owned by the state government (such as Parcels 25 and 26, which includes Reggie Wong Park).
In the 1970s, a YMCA was set up on Tyler Street on Parcel R-1 in a supposedly temporary structure that became known as “the bubble.” That “temporary” YMCA was the community’s main recreational facility for nearly three decades.
Land Swaps and Development Rights
In the late 1980s, the Chinatown community worked with the Boston Redevelopment Authority on the first neighborhood master plan.  The plan named affordable housing as a top priority and listed five public parcels as target development sites: Parcel R-1, Parcel B (now Oak Terrace), Parcel A (site of the proposed new Josiah Quincy Upper School campus), Parcel C (now the Metropolitan), Posner Lot/P-2 (current site of Asian American Civic Association and Kwong Kow Chinese School), and Parcel 12 (proposed site of the 288 Tremont Street project).
In the 1990s, both the institutions and social service agencies based in Chinatown were expanding and looking for additional space. Tufts University had been given the development rights to the P-2/Posner Lot, while Parcel R-1 was occupied by the YMCA. A series of negotiations resulted in a 1997 agreement. Tufts received development rights to Parcel R-1, Chinatown agencies received rights to the P-2 Posner Lot for construction of a community educational center, and the new YMCA was built as part of the DoubleTree Hotel project with additional funds from Tufts.
A Call to Return the Land
From 1996 on, Tufts University and the hospital leased Parcel R-1 for use as a parking lot while retaining the option to purchase and develop. This agreement was renewed several times, until the community began to organize and call for the land to be returned to community use.
In 2016, the Chinatown Community Land Trust, Chinatown Resident Association, and Chinese Progressive Association organized a postcard campaign calling for an end to the 20-year arrangement and for community development of Parcel R-1.  Chinatown CLT initiated a series of community visioning meetings and worked with urban planning students on a 2017 feasibility study that proposed returning R-1 to the community for both short term use and long term development.  As Tufts University’s agreement reached its expiration that year, the institutions, the City, and the community reached agreement that Tufts University would give up its development rights in exchange for a year-by-year lease so that the land could be developed for community priorities.
In a series of community visioning meetings organized by Chinatown CLT, residents and community members named affordable housing, a community garden or green space, recreational, retail and service space as important priorities.  Some also wanted resident parking spaces on R-1. In 2018, Chinatown CLT and Asian Community Development Corporation worked with graduate students to study the potential of a mixed-income development on R-1.
A Focus on Community Needs
Chinatown has many needs, including affordable housing, open space, a permanent library, and affordable small business space, but we know that not all needs can be addressed on one small parcel. That is why your participation is important—to help determine which needs are top priority in developing this parcel.
We are just at the beginning of many steps in the public process:  1) creating a vision, 2) release of a Request for Proposals, 3) developers bidding for the land, 4) selection of developer, 5) review of the project proposal for approval, and 6) groundbreaking and construction.
The Role of a Community Land Trust
Because development plans have many twists and turns, one of the best ways to ensure strong and continuous community control is through Community Land Trust ownership. This was a key purpose of founding the Chinatown CLT—to have a mechanism through which community residents can exert greater control over development. In a situation such as this, the CLT would not be the developer nor earn the developer fee; instead it would serve as a steward of the land through which residents can be at the table and ensure that it is always used for its intended purpose, whether short term or long term.
CLT ownership could be important to ensure that community priorities remain central as developers need to adjust the project when costs and financing change.  CLTs also can establish a ground lease to ensure that any affordable home ownership units remain permanently affordable under the community’s watchful eye, even after public financing guidelines expire. Finally, CLTs can provide for long term participatory involvement long after construction is complete in order to build a stronger sense of community.

20201120,Bank of America Names Asian American Civic Association and La Colaborativa as 2020 Neighborhood Builders®,"Program Provides $400,000 in Flexible Funding and Leadership Skills Development Training to Advance Economic Mobility in Greater Boston
BOSTON – The Asian American Civic Association and La Colaborativa, formerly known as the Chelsea Collaborative, have been named as the 2020 Bank of America Neighborhood Builders® awardees for Greater Boston. The nonprofits were selected for their work in Massachusetts to address issues fundamental to economic mobility, specifically improving the social and economic health of minority communities.
As an awardee, each organization receives a $200,000 grant, a year of leadership training for the executive director and an emerging leader, a network of peer organizations across the U.S., and the opportunity to access capital to expand their impact. Since 2004, Bank of America has invested over $260 million in 50 communities through Neighborhood Builders, partnering with more than 1,300 nonprofits and helping more than 2,600 nonprofit leaders strengthen their leadership skills.
The Asian American Civic Association is a social service organization providing education, occupational training and other services to limited English-speaking people from low to moderate income neighborhoods. La Colaborativa is a grassroots nonprofit empowering Latinx immigrants to overcome social and economic barriers.
“As we consider many of the challenges that our community is facing – from the health and humanitarian crisis brought on by the coronavirus to the need for progress on racial equality and economic opportunity – the Neighborhood Builders program is a relevant and timely initiative to support the communities we serve,” said Miceal Chamberlain, Market President, Bank of America in Massachusetts. “This program enables partners like the Asian American Civic Association and the Chelsea Collaborative to plan strategically for growth and long-term sustainability, and we look forward to seeing how this investment helps them make even greater strides to address their mission.”
The Neighborhood Builders program is an opportunity to provide relevant skills development and topics to help nonprofit leaders address current and future community challenges. Each year, Bank of America refines the Neighborhood Builders Leadership Program to include topics ranging from strategic storytelling to human capital management, and highlights themes that are critical to moving the nonprofit sector forward within broader societal and economic context.
“It’s an incredible honor to be recognized by Bank of America with a Neighborhood Builder award for the work that we are doing to uplift Latinx immigrants in Massachusetts. Our Intergenerational Workforce Development Pipeline is fueling economic and social progress by connecting historically marginalized workers to the education, training, work, and leadership opportunities that will position them to achieve economic stability in their families,” said Gladys Vega, Executive Director of La Colaborativa. “It is hard work overcoming the many systemic barriers that have excluded Latinx immigrants from economic opportunity for so long. It’s an honor to be able to lead this work and to celebrate the growth and success of our members.”
Added Mary Chin, CEO of the Asian American Civic Association: “We have been fortunate to have Bank of America as a dedicated employer partner of our Careers in Banking and Finance (CBF) job training program for many years. Now, with this significant grant, BofA is enabling AACA to great increase our tech capacity and remote learning capabilities. This will empower AACA to reach even more at-risk immigrants and economically challenged individuals, not just through CBF, but through our other job training programs for diesel techs, heavy equipment operators, and building maintenance technicians, as well as through our educational and social support services. This is especially important during these challenging times.”

20201120,Study from 2018 disproves “Model Minority” Myth,"By Jun Li
A 2018 study conducted by Pew Research Center found that the largest wealth gap in America is among Asian Americans.
The study, which was led by senior researcher Rakesh Kochhar and former research analyst Anthony Cilluffo, analyzed changes in wealth for whites, blacks, Asians and Hispanics from 1970 to 2016, finding that the income gap among all Americans increased by 8.7 times since 1970.
Most notable, however, was the change in income among Asian Americans.
“From 1970 to 2016, the gap in the standard of living between Asians near the top and the bottom of the income ladder nearly doubled, and the distribution of income among Asians transformed from being one of the most equal to being the most unequal among America’s major racial and ethnic groups,” the study wrote.
“Asians displaced blacks as the most economically divided racial or ethnic group in the U.S.,” the study wrote. “While Asians overall rank as the highest earning racial and ethnic group in the U.S., it is not a status shared by all Asians: From 1970 to 2016, the gains in income for lower-income Asians trailed well behind the gains for their counterparts in other groups.”
One reason for this disparity, the study notes, could be because of the history of Asian immigration to the United States. This finding disrupts the popular “model minority” myth, wherein people believe all Asians are a homogenous, inherently successful group of people rather than economically and culturally diverse.
The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, as well as the end of the Vietnam War in 1975, both allowed for a “surge” of Asian immigrants to enter the country early on.
“One result was that the share of new Asian immigrants working in high-skill occupations decreased from 1970 to 1990, and the share working in low-skill occupations increased,” the study wrote.
The Immigration Act of 1990 brought new changes — it effectively shifted the demographics of Asian Americans to encapsulate primarily “skilled immigrants,” and, when combined with the H-1B visa program, allowed for highly-educated Asian American professionals to make a living in the U.S.
Despite this, the income gap between Asians still remained, mostly due to the fact that large disparities in education exist within different Asian ethnic groups.
The study provided an example of the educational disparity between Indians, Bhutanese, and Burmese — 72 percent of Indians age 25 and older have a bachelor’s degree, compared to only 9 percent of Bhutanese. Additionally, the median household income of Indian families was $100,000, whereas for Burmese, it was $36,000.
“This diversity in their origins and experiences is reflected in the relatively high level of income inequality among Asians,” the study wrote.
In terms of standard of living, Asians in the top income bracket “held the edge” over all other groups. In contrast, Asians in the lower income bracket “lagged behind” whites — Asians in this bracket lived on 17 percent less income than their white counterparts.
“The Asian experience is distinguished by sharp differences in the growth in incomes across the distribution,” the study wrote.
“The trend observed nationally repeated within each racial and ethnic group,” the study wrote. “The slowdown in income growth this century did not alter the general trajectory toward a rise in income inequality, however. Those at the top of the economic ladder fared better than those at the bottom through the economic slowdowns this century.”
To discover these trends in inequality, the study analyzed data from the American Community Survey, the U.S. Census Bureau, and the decennial census. They used two separate measurements for inequality, each of which showed Asians being at the highest levels of wealth inequality compared to other groups.
“Asians and blacks are more economically divided than whites and Hispanics and, in this respect, there is a meaningful degree of separation between these two pairs of racial and ethnic groups,” the study wrote.
The study also noted that Asians did not always have the “highest level” of income inequality. In 1970, wealth inequality for Asians was comparable to whites and lower than that of Hispanics and blacks.
“Inequality among Asians increased every decade since 1970,” the study wrote.
The reason for this change, as mentioned before, is due to shifting economic demographics of Asian Americans.
“The change in the economic profile of the Asian population in recent decades reflects the immigrant experience to a large degree,” the study wrote. “Overall, Asian immigrants have higher levels of education than native-born Americans … As a result, many Asian immigrants are settling in at the top of the income distribution and likely stretching its boundaries into higher reaches.”
Despite this trend, however, the study notes that other ethnic groups within the term “Asian American” haven’t experienced the same economic growth. For example, poverty rates were “35 percent among Burmese, 33 percent among Bhutanese and 28 percent among Hmong and Malaysians, compared with 15.1 percent in the U.S. overall.”
“The wide diversity in the education and income profiles of Asian origin groups is reflected in the relatively wide gap in their income distribution,” the study wrote.
The study thus disproves the model minority myth that Asian Americans are all wealthy and successful — many Asians who don’t fit into this conventional mold are frequently erased because so many hold this false belief.
Although Asians make up those with the highest gap in income inequality, the study notes that this is a problem that pervades among all racial and ethnic groups in America.
“The state of income inequality within racial and ethnic groups and the gaps in incomes across them provide complementary, yet distinct, insights into the well-being of these groups of Americans,” the study wrote. “The fact that inequality increased within each racial and ethnic group shows that no community was immune to the factors said to have raised U.S. inequality since 1970.”

20201120,Food for Thought: Melodias,"Melodias, translated into English, means “melodies.” It is a lovely Colombian restaurant and bar in the Orient Heights neighborhood of East Boston (just steps from the Orient Heights Blue Line T stop). Melodias now serves take out and some limited dine in seating, at the already cozy restaurant. There is a flat screen tv playing Latin music videos in the background.
For our drinks, we got the Guanábana, also known as sour sop milk, custard apple, and a blackberry milk, for $4 each. Think of a fresh fruit milk shake (without the ice cream), served in mason jars. Both were lightly sweet and very refreshing. To start, we had the traditional empanada de carne ($2), which was fried, with a slightly crispy cornmeal crust, and stuffed with beef and potatoes. It came with two kinds of dipping sauces, aji pepper and green chile verde dipping sauces, which went well with the empanada.
Our entrees came out, and we ordered the entraña ($19), a marinated skirt steak. The plate was sandwiched between the brisket and flank parts of the cow. This dish has roots in Argentinian cuisine. There was a huge portion of meat, served with a side of rice and beans, and it came with some lovely baby boiled yellow potatoes, with a chimichurri sauce drizzled on top. We requested it to be cooked at medium. The steak was tender, juicy, and full of rich meaty flavor. The parsley based chimichurri sauce, with oil and herbs, brightened the dish in every bite. Filet mignon is just as tender but does not even have a quarter of this dish flavor.

The unofficial national dish of Colombia is the bandeja Paisa (Paisa is a region of Colombia’s platter or cowboy’s platter). Here it is called the bandeja Melodias ($19.50). This heaping plate of food consists of two kinds of sausage, fried chicharrón (pork belly), rice, beans, fried egg, and fried sweet whole plantain. We loved the murcillo (blood sausage), and the other was made with beef and pork sausage. This was great, with fried pork belly that was not over cooked. I found the crispy skin to be crunchy without being overly chewy. It is a hearty and filling dish, with the lovely fried runny egg, and it is no wonder this dish is favored. Luckily, we brought our appetites with us for this meal.
We finished our meal with the tres leches (three milk) pastry cake ($5) and churros with ice cream $6. Both were just right, as we wanted dessert, but nothing too big. The tres leches had light and not overly sweet cake, served with whipped cream, with chocolate drizzle. The churros (Spanish and Portugal origin) were cut up very crispy and were doughy, served with vanilla ice cream. This balanced the hot churros, which were sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar on top. Plus, there was caramel sauce on each churro piece.

Service was friendly and attentive. Our waitress kindly and enthusiastically answered all my questions. Plus, my friend translated from Spanish to English when needed, which was very helpful.  Tables were spaced out, and there was hand sanitizer at the entrance. I fell in love with the food, especially the entraña, and want to go back for more. If you find yourself in East Boston, do check out this lovely gem, Melodias, out.

20201120,Chinese Restaurant Finances in the 1920s,"How much did Chinese restaurants earn during the 1920s? How were they financed? And what did they pay their employees? We can get some insight into the answers through examining two restaurants, the Royal Restaurant in Chinatown and the Imperial Restaurant in Cambridge, both connected by one of the same partners, Chung Moi.
Chung Moi was born in China and came to San Francisco in 1912, where he remained for about three years before moving to Boston. There, he first worked as a manager at the Imperial Restaurant, which had opened in 1915 for only two years. In 1919, Moi began working as a manager at the Royal Restaurant, having purchased a $500 ownership interest from the prior manager, and soon thereafter acquiring an additional $1200 interest.
The Royal Restaurant had 42 partners, with a total interest of $15,490, although only five were active, including Moi. The additional active partners included Ng Chung, who worked as a cashier and had a $1400 interest, Wong Foon, who worked as a cook and had a $300 interest, Lang Yow, who worked in the kitchen and had a $200 interest, and Quong Kwok Kee, who worked as a waiter and had a $100 interest. Do you know any waiters in modern restaurants who are active partners in a restaurant?
The Royal Restaurant seated over 100 people, was protected with $12,000 in insurance, and paid a monthly rent of $275. The restaurant made over $6,000 a month and in the previous year paid 10% in dividends to the partners. Today, that monthly $6,000 would be equivalent to about $86,000, equating to about $1 million a year. Chung originally received $90 a month (about $1200 today) in his position as the manager, but that amount decreased to $70 when business declined.
Cambridge Tribune, October 2, 1915: Advertisement for the Imperial Chinese Restaurant
Chung Moy didn’t last long at that restaurant, leaving the U.S. in June 1921 and traveling back to China, where he got married and had a son. He returned to the U.S. in 1923, without his family, and became a partner in the Imperial Restaurant in Cambridge. He purchased a $700 interest from Jung Hoy Lan, who was likely his father. Chung also replaced Howard Chew as the manager.
There were 33 partners in the restaurant, though only seven were active. The active partners included Howard Chew, who worked as a cashier and buyer and had a $500 interest, Chu Chung, who worked as a cook and was in charge of the kitchen, and had a $500 interest, Chu Jung Yu, who worked as a cook and had a $500 interest, Quan Chuck, who worked as a waiter and had a $500 interest, Ling Gim, who worked as a cook and had a $500 interest, and Chu Yick Yin, who worked as a cook and had a $500 interest. The total capitalization of the restaurant was $13,500.
As the manager, Chung earned a salary of $100 per month. The restaurant, which sat about 170 people, leased their second-floor location, and their lease was set to expire in 1931. The premises had about $18,000 in insurance, including fire, plate glass and liability. An examination of the restaurants’ books showed it made an average of $3500 a month, an equivalent today of about $52,000, or $624,000 a year. In 1936, Chung Moi decided to sell his interest in the restaurant and move to California.
In comparing the Royal Restaurant and Imperial Restaurant, we see that both were large-size restaurants and required a fair amount of capital to establish, garnering from 42 partners and 33 partners, respectively. The five active partners at the Royal had interests ranging from $100 to $1700, while the seven active partners at the Imperial averaged at $500 interest each.
It generally cost about $500 to start a Chinese laundry. Starting a restaurant was more expensive and beyond the means of many Chinese. That is an important reason why so many Chinese started laundries rather than restaurants. However, by forming larger partnerships, they could become part of a restaurant for a similar investment to starting a laundry. As for the active partners, they all worked in the restaurant, occupying positions from waiter to cook, cashier to manager. Little was said about the silent partners in these restaurants, except the one time they received dividends of 10%.
We also got a small glimpse into some of the monthly wages of the restaurant workers, such as Chung who received a salary ranging from $70 to $100 a month as a manager. As for the restaurants’ incomes, the Royal was earning about $6000 a month while the Imperial only earned about $3500. Considering the low cost of much of the Chinese cuisine, these restaurants were likely doing a very good business, especially the Royal.
With many thanks to Dr. Raymond Douglas Chong, who provided me a copy of the Immigration & Naturalization file of Chung Moi, his grandfather, which provided much of the financial information for this article.

20201120,City of Boston releases coastal resilience solutions for Downtown Boston and North End,"The virtual panel of Climate Ready Boston on Thursday, October 29 released two reports offering coastal resilience solutions, with the most recent one targeting Downtown Boston and North End, and the other: Dorchester.  The reports further developed and specified the City of Boston’s strategies to realize its vision of a resilient Boston harbor and confronting climate change. In the reports, the Climate Ready Boston team outlined a roadmap for near- and long-term solutions to defend coastal flooding, stressing the importance of the public-private collaboration between stakeholders.
“Climate change is about people,” Christopher Cook, Boston’s Chief of Environment, Energy, and Open Space, said on the panel. “Who are the people in these neighborhoods? Where do they work? How do they get to that work? Where do they live? At the end of the day, the reason we’re doing this work is to protect the people and to protect the neighborhoods that they live in.”
“It’s only through a collaborative effort, through partnership that we’re actually going to implement any of these solutions,” Cook said, adding that they have been analyzing neighborhoods block by block and conducting conversations with owners of private and public entities.
The four core resilience strategies presented in the CRS report for Downtown Boston and North End include expanded open space, harbor walk enhancements, more offshore elements, and the addition of spines.
Existing open space — for example, Langone Park and Puopolo Playground — are undergoing new projects. One such project will elevate the parks’ back edge to defend against 21 inches of the sea level rise, explained Peyton Siler Jones, a Climate Resilience Program coordinator, during the panel. The $15.3 million project, which will expand recreational opportunities, is anticipated to be completed in late fall.
Offshore elements refer to the solution of using ecological systems at the water’s edge to reduce the wave action and provide environmental co-benefits, Jones stated. According to “Coastal Resilience Solutions for Downtown and North End,” spines are linear elements such as roadways and bike paths that elevate the landscape and prevent floodwater.
Faced with climate change, people are expecting and currently experiencing four core changes in their daily life: hotter days, increased precipitation, sea-level rise, and more frequent and fiercer coastal storms.
For Chinatown residents, in particular, Jones and Zoe Davis, another Climate Resilience Project coordinator, provided some information and suggestions on how they can become better adapted for climate change as individuals and small business owners.
The first thing you could do is look at your physical location and figure out the climate vulnerability around there, Jones said. In general, the projected 40-inch sea level by 2070 could lead to flooding across most of South Boston to the Chinatown neighborhood, according to the report of “Coastal Resilience Solutions for South Boston,” released in 2018.
“If there’s a small business owner in Chinatown, who’s not totally sure if their building is vulnerable to climate change in the long term, reaching out to Zoe or me, and we can connect that business owner with resources,” Jones added.
She and Davis also encouraged people to talk about climate change in the community and disperse related information to each other. Davis introduced a citywide program called Greenovate Boston Leaders. By signing up for the program, residents can get related training on leading the community’s conversation around climate change.
“It essentially is a program to help Boston residents equip themselves with the information and tools that they need to help their community be climate-prepared,” Davis said. “Whether it’s just information on what the city is doing with regards to climate, or helping residents organize initiatives in their own neighborhoods.”
Climate change is not all about doom and gloom as it presents in some press coverages, “it can be, but in Boston, we really see it as an opportunity,” Jones said. “All the climate action that the mayor is leading, and that the city of Boston is engaging in, is full of opportunities to make everyone’s lives better.”

20201120,How to Protect Yourself from Eviction during the COVID-19 Pandemic,"By Yu Sin Mok, Greater Boston Legal Services
The Massachusetts eviction ban protecting tenants from evictions ended on October 17, 2020, so landlords can now file eviction cases in courts again. The Asian Outreach Unit of Greater Boston Legal Services answers legal questions over the phone, and we often hear from low-income Asian clients who are struggling to pay rent. Many are concerned about losing their homes, after having lost their jobs and income during COVID-19. This situation is stressful, especially when low-income families typically live in areas with high rates of displacement and rent increases.
If you find yourself in a similar situation, you can do two things to protect yourself from evictions. Also, remember that your landlord cannot evict without following the right steps through the court process.
First, if you cannot pay rent, a federal rule may protect you from eviction through the end of the year. This federal rule is called the Center for Disease Control (CDC) eviction ban.
This CDC eviction ban can protect low-income tenants who 1) cannot pay rent because you lost a lot of income or because you pay a lot of medical expenses due to COVID-19, 2) try to pay some rent when possible and try to get government help for rent, and 3) will likely become homeless if evicted.
To be protected, send your landlord a one-page letter that can be found through the CDC website. The letter will state that you have a right to not be evicted under the CDC eviction ban. Each adult in your family should sign the letter. Then send the letters to your landlord by mail or email. Make sure to keep a copy of this letter for your records.
Second, you can apply for state rent assistance, which is required anyway to receive protection from the CDC eviction ban. In Massachusetts, you may be able to get up to $4,000 to $10,000 in rent assistance. If you need help applying, you can contact the Asian Community Development Corporation at 857-449-7131 for Cantonese and 857-449-7132 for Mandarin. For Vietnamese, call VietAID at 617-804-2456. For English and other languages call 211 or Metro Housing Boston. After you set up an appointment, you need to gather some basic documents, such as your income information, lease, and any proof that you owe rent.
Despite the CDC eviction ban and rent assistance, your landlord may still try to evict you. Contact us right away if your landlord tries to evict, and we can discuss how you can protect yourself. If you have any questions, call us at 617-603-1809 for help in Cantonese, Mandarin, and Vietnamese.

20201120,"Mayor’s Office addresses election results, COVID-19, housing stability and police reform","On November 12, Mayor Marty Walsh provided several updates on the changes and proposals made by his office at both a roundtable with the Office for Immigrant Advancement (MOIA) and a public Media Availability.
In light of the historical election, Mayor Walsh said, “I’m looking forward to working with the administration.” Specifically, the mayor is hopeful that things will be different with the new administration for the immigrant community.
“I do believe that Vice President Biden and Senator Harris, they are going to be good for Boston and great for America, especially for our immigrant community,” said Mayor Walsh. “I do feel that President-elect Biden already has, in my understanding, executive orders; DACA was one of those. Executive orders in TPS, executive orders that we can initiate on day one, the first second they’re in administration, that they can be law of the land.”
As for the COVID-19 crisis, Boston is also experiencing an uptick in cases. With the recently launched “Get the Test, Boston” Campaign, the positive COVID tests in Boston increased, yet the rate stayed the same, at 7.2% as of November 6. The good news is that this means more people are getting tested, giving us more accurate data to track and contain the virus. However, the bad news is that Boston is really experiencing a spike in COVID-cases.
Mayor Walsh said, “My advice is you look at three numbers, you look at the average daily case, you look at the average positive daily rate, and also look at hospitalization. If two of those are in a high place, we’re not in a good place. Right now, we’re not necessarily in a great space.”
For this reason, the Boston Public Schools at the moment remain fully remote. During media availability, Mayor Walsh mentioned working with Public Health Experts on new guidelines reviewed by the superintendent and the Boston School Committee to reopen schools safely.
The mayor recommends that everyone remains vigilant: wear masks, maintain six feet of social distancing, and wash your hands frequently. On top of that, Boston is once again under curfew, now from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. This is in response to Governor Charlie Baker’s statement, a week before, regarding guidelines to prevent another shutdown. With the understanding that businesses would be devastated if Boston is to go into lockdown again, Mayor Walsh stated at the media availability that he would be monitoring the numbers closely for the next 10 days to see how effective the curfew is in controlling the spread.
Although Pfizer reported that they are at 90% effective in their COVID-19 vaccine development, Mayor Walsh “took a wild guess” that it will take until the summer for the pandemic to be over. This has to do with distribution and properly ensuring everyone has access to the vaccine once available. While there are no discussions yet about financial coverage for the vaccines, Mayor Walsh said, “We have to make sure that insurance covers the vaccines,” just like the funded COVID tests that are available in more than 30 locations.
In the case of Housing Stability, there is a new act passed that requires landlords to provide information about legal and financial resources when evicting their tenants. Deputy Director of the Office of Housing Stability, Dominique Williams, said, “This act provides and requires landlords and foreclosing owners to provide the information when they’re serving a notice to quit. The notification document that we have is available in 11 languages on our website. It requires any foreclosing and landlord to give us a copy of that as well.”
While a violation of the act will not stop an eviction, tenants can report the breach to the Office of Fair Housing and Equity. After an investigation, the Inspectional Services Department can issue a warning and a fine of up to $300 per day for subsequent offenses. For more information about this act, visit https://boston.gov/housing-stability to learn more. Landlords can visit https://boston.gov/landlord-notification, and tenants may visit https://boston.gov/tenant-notification.
As for police reform, Mayor Walsh updated the progress of his pledge to achieve all the final recommendations a month ago, in a timeline that the task force laid out. Mayor Walsh announced that they filed a petition to give Boston high School graduates a preference in police hiring. Along with the Chief of Equity and other city leaders and the police department, they updated policies through an equity lens. They also created a diversity and inclusion unit as well as a job description for the Executive Director of the proposed Office of Public Police Accountability and Transparency.
This is still not final and has yet to be addressed by the City Council until the hearing on December 3. Mayor Walsh said, “I hope that the City Council will act quickly on this, so we can advocate together for this petition before the state legislature in the start of the new session in January.”

20201120,Scammers revamp old tricks using COVID-19 as a twist during pandemic,"Fraudulent rental listings, a COVID-19 clinical study that pays upwards of $1,000, consultants offering services to those confused by COVID aid programs, a government agency asking for a refund of an “accidental” overpayment — these are some of the most popular schemes that fraudsters have taken advantage of during the pandemic to target people’s financial worries in 2020.
Indeed, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) reported losses from scams have climbed to nearly $117 million during the first six months of the pandemic, compared to 2019, where the total reported loss was $134 million. Coronavirus-related scams, in particular, have cost Americans $13.4 million so far this year, and the internet is the hotspot for it. According to the FTC’s Consumer Sentinel Network reports, losses from social media scams have tripled, with a sharp spike in the second quarter of 2020. The increase corresponds with increased internet usage that started with the early March lockdowns and has only grown since.
Another platform that has received more reports of illegal schemes and fraud is the Better Business Bureau’s (BBB) online Scam Tracker.
“We have seen an increase in online scams reported via bbb.org/scamtracker, and that is for both people that have been victims of a scam or people that are aware of scams transpiring in their area,” said Paula Fleming, chief marketing and sales officer for the Boston BBB.
Fleming noted that the latest scam is surrounding the underway trials as companies race to find effective vaccines and treatments for COVID-19. Although some studies are legitimate, the fraudulent ones target people through texts, promising $1,000 in payment for participation. By redirecting users to a website and asking for identifying information, the scammers could download malware onto your computer or collect this information for use in future phishing attacks.
Scammers frequently utilize pretending to be a researcher or government official as a common tactic. They have made such phone calls and texts in Chinese and other languages, possibly targeting specific racial or immigrant demographics. Fleming said she personally has not received reports of these scams, but said that Chinatown might be unaware of the BBB as an outlet to report scams.
One scam that was prevalent in August was an imposter call from someone pretending to be from the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. In the call, the scammers often tell the victim their immigration status is being revoked, and the police are on their way to arrest or deport them unless they pay right away.
Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healy said their office put out an advisory in multiple languages, hoping to “reach communities of color to make sure we were getting them information in a language accessible to them.”
The pandemic has opened an opportunity for scammers to revamp pre-existing schemes and techniques in the rental market as well. A quick Google search will tell you that being told an apartment is not available for viewing before renting is typically a glaring red flag for a rental scam. But during a global pandemic, this practice is common. When traditional safeguards, like in-person viewings, are limited, it becomes significantly more difficult for people to validate listings.
After people started browsing for September leases, Healy received several complaints from prospective tenants about false website listings using real photos and management contact information. Through these ads, scammers took people’s deposits and redirected their complaints to the provided contact information of an actual broker or management company on the listing.
Greg Vasil, the CEO and President of the Greater Boston Real Estate Board, was made aware of this scam through the brokers’ perspective. “We got contacted by some of our broker members that people were calling them up, and they were irate because they said, ‘Hey, I sent you a deposit for this apartment. What’s going on?’” he explained. “They were stealing the information from the listing, putting it online, putting it out there, and people were sending the money. But it wasn’t to the actual owner. It was basically a scam.”
“I can’t believe this, but this is what’s going on. And it’s an old trick, but the new twist was COVID,” Vasil added. Healy cited a combination of reasons for the rise in the prevalence of these scams. She said, “In-person viewings have been more limited or less possible, so people are turning to websites more. And it’s certainly true that people are having economic hardship and may be looking for ways to find housing, without going through a broker and having to pay the broker’s fee.”
In response, the Attorney General’s Office and GBREB partnered to issue an advisory in September, warning the public about the apartment leasing scam. The advisory offered guidance on avoiding falling victim and ensuring listings are valid during this time, such as encouraging thorough inspection of the apartment, not disclosing social security or PayPal information, and reporting fraudulent ads.
“We directed people to file complaints with the FBI’s Internet Crimes Complaint Center. So, the FBI may have heard from people. We haven’t received additional complaints since issuing the advisory. Maybe the advisory helped get the word out to people,” Healey updated.
Although Healey said they have not received an uptick in scam calls in the months since, she still strongly recommends following the guidance and filing a fraud report if anyone falls victim. “I think it’s a good point that some people may be embarrassed that they ended up scammed, but I would tell them don’t be embarrassed. Call my office. Report scams. Report it to the FBI internet crimes division as well,” she emphasized.
For COVID-related financial scams, Fleming advised that the specific steps you need to take depend on the nature of a particular scam, stating, “In some cases, it would be contacting the police department. In some cases, it would be simply letting bbb.org and your community know via the scam tracker, and in other cases, it would be telling the local, state government agencies, the Attorney General’s Office.”

20201120,Immigrants view banks with skepticism and fear,"Particularly among those who have newly arrived in the United States, many immigrated individuals choose not to use banks and are wary of financial institutions for several reasons. Cultural barriers may deter them from employing these services, while past negative experiences in their home countries also cause immigrant residents to exercise caution. Financial literacy programs and efforts from banks to become more accessible have been encouraging for this population, but many are still hesitant to open an account.
Language challenges may be the first obstacle an immigrant may face to using banks in Boston, according to Robin Wood, a program manager in banking and finance careers at the Asian American Civic Association. While many banks in Chinatown have worked to make their branches more diverse and inclusive, having staff and tellers who speak Mandarin, individuals may not feel comfortable if they cannot communicate in their first language.
“Let’s think about when you go into a bank, and you’re trying to open an account, and no one speaks your language,” said Wood. “The money is different, the whole economy is different, the laws are different. …For immigrants, it’s language, learning the new economic system, the new banking system. …You come to a great big bank, and everybody’s moving fast and talking fast. That could leave you feeling isolated.”
Some immigrants, like Bao En Qiu, have had more positive experiences with banks in the United States. Qiu moved from China to Randolph, Massachusetts to live with his son in December 2008 and initially felt “helpless,” finding the change “very stressful.” After about half a month, he began working in a restaurant that paid him in checks. An acquaintance told him to open a bank account and referred him to East West Bank, where the staff was patient and understood the language. He only uses a savings account, not a checking account, and most frequently pays for his rent and groceries with cash.
Executive director of the Asian Community Development Corporation Angie Liou said that reluctance to use a bank in the United States might come from a person’s past relationship to banking in the country they left. In some Asian countries, the banking system and the government are intertwined, which may have led to distrust. Immigrants may be guarded about personal information, and they may feel that their savings are not secure, as there may have been incidents of theft in their home countries. In some cases, said Liou, these feelings stem from a general anxiety about authority figures.
“It’s probably a general distrust of large institutions, authorities,” said Liou. “I don’t think it’s limited to just banks. We do a lot of civic engagement, which is getting people to participate in public affairs but also register to vote. There’s also a lot of skepticism there – ‘Will my vote really matter? Will what I say, if I speak up at a meeting, really matter?’ The powers that be – are they just going to make decisions? They’re coming from many places where things are a lot more top down. It’s not a democratic system, so they feel like a lot of things are fixed against them.”
According to Michael Andelman, program manager for Bank On Boston at the Mayor’s Office of Financial Empowerment, immigrants who choose not to use banks in the United States frequently save money within their homes, a practice that is not secure.
“It’s a question that the Internal Revenue Service will ask an individual in the course of an audit – the question, “do you have large sums of money in your home?’” said Andelman. “This is very unsafe, because it could be stolen. Sometimes people who don’t have a home or who are in transition have it on their body. …It has to do with the education, that it’s not safe to have money lying around one’s home. One does have twenty-four hour access to their money when they have a mainstream financial account. But one needs to be told that. …These individuals are paying with cash, as opposed to using a credit card or check.”
Another reason why new residents may not deposit their money in a bank may be that they have worries about their immigrant status, that their information may in some way be passed to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. In addition, said Andelman, some nations that are viewed as terrorist-related countries are on lists for financial institutions that make it more difficult to use their services. But if somebody is turned away from opening an account, it is important to go to a supervisor or branch manager and exercise one’s individual rights.
Wood, who said that she had been employed in the banking business for a long time, emphasized that a personal dynamic is important in having a client view the institution as reliable.
“I’ve worked in banks for many years, and it’s based on trust,” said Wood. “I had to earn the trust of whatever community, because they will keep their money at home – under the mattress, or whatever. And it’s building trust, getting one person in the community to come and bank with me, then another, and another. Finding people in my branch that spoke the language. Once word gets out, they will all usually come to that one branch and that one person.”

20201106,"Beyond neighborhoods and generations: ‘Lantern Stories’ continues illuminating Chinatown’s past, present, and future","More than a month after its initial installation, crowds of Chinatown natives and tourists alike are still gathering in Chin Park on The Greenway to see “Lantern Stories.” The public art project by artist Yu-Wen Wu captures the culture, immigration history, and continued resilience of Boston’s Chinatown community in each of its 31 UV-printed colorful lanterns.
The concepts for the lanterns’ featured images were conceived in a collaborative, dynamic process. Wu spoke to local residents, community organizers, and businesses about their own family immigration stories, current issues facing Chinatown, and hopes for Chinatown’s future in community listening sessions. With this storytelling template in place, the lanterns themselves are grounded in a collective but often forgotten history.
Wu explained the specific inspiration behind individual lanterns to more than 100 attendees of The Greenway’s live virtual event “Lighting the Way: Exploring ‘Lantern Stories’ in Boston’s Chinatown” on October 29. “One lantern, in particular, examines the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act and the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act,” she said. “Such systemic acts of racism, coupled with personal and daily struggles with xenophobia, drove Chinese Americans to build their own ethnic enclaves or Chinatowns across the country.”
Wu’s work also explored the themes of encroachment and displacement, specifically through the lens of Chinatown’s response to them through protest. Wu highlighted a two-tier lantern that spoke directly to the community’s historical activism. The bottom tier memorializes the demolition of the 700 Hudson Street homes, which displaced 2,700 Chinese and other immigrant families, while the top tier depicts peaceful protests to halt the expansion of the Combat Zone, the City’s official red-light district in the 1960s and 70s, into Chinatown.
Additionally, some lanterns touch on Chinese entrepreneurship, featuring scenes from the laundry industry, restaurants, and apothecaries that sold herbal and medicinal ingredients. These older scenes of a more traditional Chinatown’s herbal shops and storefronts reminded Vivien Li, an attendee of Thursday’s virtual event, of the Chinatown of her childhood in New York. “The fact that we can all identify, and she sort of captures that. I think that’s why it’s such a brilliant installation, in the sense that it doesn’t matter what part of the country you come from, particularly if you’re Asian, it just captures those feelings,” Li said.
Indeed, Wu explained that she did not draw inspiration from only Boston’s Chinatown, but rather from a broader historical context, drawing from archival photographs. She noted that neighborhood natives have identified family members within the images. “Amy Chin Guen said of the image of Toy Len Goon, ‘Oh, that’s my mother-in-law!’ who was voted American Mother of the Year in 1952. And Stephanie Fan told me, ‘That is my brother at ten years old,’ and ‘She was my teacher,’ ‘He was my neighbor’… It was amazing! I selected these images based on what the photo represented historically, not knowing these families personally,” Wu said.
As for the lanterns’ incorporation of current events, Wu said, “At the time that I was starting to make decisions, it wasn’t parallel to when COVID started,” as she received the commission in June 2019. “When the murder of George Floyd happened in May and Black Lives Matter movement escalated, it became evident that this project needed to have deeper discussions on historic and current inequities, and systemic racism.”
These decisions culminated in the creation of an Asian American activism and Black Lives Matter lantern. The words “Fight the Virus, Not the People” across it speaks to diverting anti-Asian sentiments surrounding the virus’s spread. Through the Black Lives Matter lantern,
Wu wanted to communicate that “from the civil rights movement of the 1960s to the present day, the Asian-American community stands in solidarity with their Black sisters and brothers.”
Wu also shared a community reaction to this particular lantern from a non-Asian resident, who told Wu that “she sometimes feels outside this community… but when she saw the lantern for Black Lives Matter and Asians for Black Lives, she felt touched and thought there is acceptance.” Wu added that she was grateful to hear that story because it indicated the lanterns’ topics could extend in a conversation beyond Chinatown itself.
Li found that compared to the day when the lanterns are viewed by predominantly locals, many non-Asian tourists visited them at night. “I would say, you know, there was maybe a third Chinese? Maybe 40% Chinese, but a lot of visitors, a lot of the younger people as well, so they must have read about it.”
In addition to transcending regional and neighborhood-specific stories, the lanterns seem to go beyond generations. When Li brought her family to experience the lanterns, she said each of the two generations had different takeaways. “My daughter was amazed that there was a Black Lives Matter lantern because that’s so contemporary. That’s so timely.” On the other hand, Li recalled her brother and sister in law admired the older lanterns, reminding them of traditional Chinatown.
“Lantern Stories” will be displayed over the public gathering space in front of the Chinatown Gate until November 15. The Greenway Conservancy and Wu discussed the possibility of reinstalling this artwork in 2021 or relocating it to a different space, contingent on future funding.

20201106,The First Chinese Person To Live In Boston,"In 1796, the first Chinese person documented to have lived in Boston was Chou, a teenager who worked for a local sea captain. Much of that story is known to many and the sea captain is often considered to be a kind and compassionate person. However, there is a dark twist to this story which is known to very few.
John Boit, of Boston, was made the Captain of a ship, the Union, when he was only 19 years old. The Union, with a crew of 22, set sail on August 1, 1794, headed to the Northwest, to obtain pelts and other trade goods, and then onto China. After a successful journey, the Union returned to Boston in July 1796. While in China, Boit hired a Chinese servant, called Chou, who was about 15 or 16 years old, and took him back to Boston with him. Chou likely lived with Boit, especially considering they were only in Boston for a month before departing on another voyage.
Boit was given the command of another ship, the Snow George, which departed, with Chou aboard, in August 1796 to Mauritius, an island in the Indian Ocean. The ship arrived in March 1797, and was later sold in May 1797, after which Boit decided to spend some vacation time in Mauritius. According to The Boit Family And Their Descendants by Robert Althorp Boit (1915), John Boit wrote, “Took a house on shore, attended by my faithful servant Chou (a Chinese)—kept Bachelor’s hall—and in the gay life that is generally pursued by young men on this island passed a few months away in quite an agreeable though dissipated manner.”
Boit returned to Boston sometime during the summer of 1798, and again, it is very likely that Chou lived with Boit at that point, especially as it would only be for a short time before tragedy took Chou. On September 11, 1798, Chou fell from the masthead of the ship Mac of Boston, though details of this accident are scant. Boit took an extraordinary step at this point, having Chou interred in the Central Burying Ground in Boston, and erecting a tombstone for him.
The epitaph read, “Here lies interred the body of Chou Mandarien. A native of China. Aged 19 years whose death was occasioned on the 11th Sept. 1798 by a fall from the masthead of the Ship Mac of Boston. This stone is erected to his memory by his affectionate master John Boit, Jr.” In the epitaph, the term “Mandarien” is not intended to be a surname, but simply a term at that time meaning “Chinese.” You can still visit this cemetery and view his tombstone.
Though the burial and tombstone may create the impression that John Boit was an empathetic person, there is a darker side to this story which most sources writing about this matter omit.
At the time of Chou’s death, it appears that Boit was preparing the Mac of Boston to illegally engage in the African slave trade, and if Chou had lived, he would have accompanied Boit on this expedition. The Lancaster Intelligencer (PA), September 25, 1799, reported that the Mac of Boston was condemned in the District Court of Maine for a “breach of the laws of the United States against the slave trade.”
The ship apparently left Boston in November 1798, two months after the death of Chou, and allegedly was headed to Cape de Verde but Captain Boit had different plans in mind, desirous of going to Africa to purchase slaves. The crew was unaware of his plans until several weeks into the journey. Boit eventually acquired 270 slaves, male and female, and sailed to Havana, Cuba, where he sold the 220 slaves which survived the trip, 50 Africans having died en route.
The newspaper stated, “The record of these facts, will remain an eternal monument of disgrace to mankind. A savage, who had not abjured both nature and its God, would shrink with horror at this complicated tale of crime and misery. What then shall we say of a Christian, a Bostonian, who accumulates his wealth by this nefarious and infernal traffick.” Unfortunately, I’ve been unable to find out the results of this court case though it does not seem likely Boit received any significant punishment as he continued to captain other ships.
For example, The Boit Family And Their Descendantsby Robert Althorp Boit (1915) noted that Boit was married in August 1799, and “During the first years of marriage, Boit’s wife, Eleanor, lived in Newport while he was at sea; later they moved to Jamaica Plain and then Boston.” In addition, Boit made voyages on the Mount Hope from Newport, Rhode Island, to the East Indies and back in 1801-02 and 1805-06. It seems likely that if he was convicted, any punishment he received was relatively minor.
As far as we are aware, John Boit treated Chou well, but that does not absolve him of his crimes of engaging in illegal slavery. It is also unfortunate that Chou died so young as who knows what he might have accomplished as an adult. You can visit the Central Burying Ground, see Chou’s tombstone, and honor this pioneering young Chinese person, taken from the world far too soon.

20201106,Clean-up Chinatown Committee continues the push for a cleaner Chinatown,"The Asian American Civic Association (AACA) hosted the first Clean-up Chinatown Committee meeting since the COVID-19 pandemic struck. For many years, the committee has worked to clean up the streets of Chinatown. Due to COVID-19 restrictions, the meetings were suspended for about eight months before resuming on October 14.
This meeting followed the efforts of the “We Love Boston Chinatown” campaign and the cleanup day hosted by Chinatown Mainstreet (CMS) and Boston Chinatown Neighborhood Center (BCNC) in August. On October 9, rather than host another cleanup day, Tufts University took the lead in hosting “311 Day” to educate the public about the number to call for requesting non-emergency services.
The 311 flyers at the outreach event also had simplified Chinese instructions for calling the line. Pallavi Shrestha, from AACA, said, “For example, if there are broken lights or their trash on the streets, we basically highlighted that for 311 was basically a complaint line because a lot of people around the Chinatown community didn’t know what that was.”
The committee plans to make this an annual outreach event to remind everyone about the complaint line. Those present at the October 14 meeting included AACA members, Raymond Cheng from the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association, Helen Kwok from the Chinese Business Association, and the Mayor’s Office’s Lisa Hy as well as City Councilor Ed Flynn.
The committee discussed targeting systematic changes to make towards keeping a better and cleaner Chinatown neighborhood. Previously, AACA also participated in the Boston City Council hearing on illegal dumping and rodent control on September 22.
CEO of AACA Mary Chin said, “We want very much every muscle, the only way we can get muscle is to have our community working with city officials.”
Working alongside other efforts to clean up and beautify Chinatown, the committee plans to meet monthly to check-in on the progress towards the community’s betterment.
Councilor Flynn said, “Thank you to the volunteers that did an outstanding job last week at the cleanup day with the translations and then 311 outreach. It’s groups like AACA that work hard to represent the community and make sure that they’re treated fairly with respect and dignity.”

20201106,Anti-Asian sentiment and lack of space disincentivizes Chinatown outdoor dining,"By Christine Mui and Jun Li
Outdoor dining in Boston has flourished during the last few weeks despite COVID-19 rates steadily rising, but one neighborhood seems to have been left behind. Restaurants in Chinatown, where the pandemic’s economic impacts hit first and hard, have stayed reluctant to make the switch to outdoor dining, choosing to stick to takeout only instead.
Approval for outdoor dining requires obtaining temporary extension of a premise permit from the Licensing Board for the City of Boston — a process permitted until December for outdoor dining on public property and indefinitely for private property. Yet, of the 467 restaurants in Boston currently licensed and open for outdoor dining, only nine are located in the Chinatown/Leather District, and even fewer are Chinese-owned.
The online directions, application, FAQs, and other resources are not offered in Chinese, as of October 30th. City Councilor Ed Flynn, who represents Chinatown, said the language barrier and lack of translation services may have played a role in fewer applications from Chinese restaurant owners. “Language access is also an ongoing challenge,” he said. “But the City of Boston needs to do a better job of providing language access to residents who speak Cantonese, and that’s my top priority.”
For most restaurants, the lack of preexisting outdoor dining infrastructure and experience also contributed to their reluctance to apply for a permit. Steve Clark, vice president of government affairs at the Massachusetts Restaurant Association, explained that “to begin with, a very small percentage of restaurants actually had outdoor dining available prior to the pandemic. Many had to build up from scratch.” Even those restaurants previously approved for outdoor dining required new licenses amidst COVID-19.
Clark added it is unlikely that delayed permits were the reason for the lower prevalence of outdoor dining in Chinatown, as “the City has been really active in getting permits distributed.” However, he speculated that there could have been “possibly a delay in updating websites or how the website search function works, but I can’t say whether that is true or not.”

A decline in clientele, due to racist misconceptions about COVID-19’s transmission, is another hurdle for restaurant owners deciding whether to expand beyond takeout. According to Councilor Flynn, tourism has been nearly non-existent. “I do see more people going back to Chinatown, but you know, it’s been a very difficult road for our restaurants in Chinatown,” he said. “I’ve noticed significant anti-Asian sentiment throughout the country — bullying, intimidation of the Asian community.”
Although COVID-19 caused Chinatown’s Q Restaurant to close for two months before reopening for indoor-dining and takeout options, its general manager Billy Gu found that since restrictions have eased, they’re doing “much better than anticipated,” thanks to their loyal customer base.
“We reopened one month for takeout, and after that, it’s been getting better than worse,” Gu said. “[It’s] nothing compared to what we used to do, but given the fact that it’s during the pandemic, I am definitely not complaining about what we do right now.”
Compared to other Boston neighborhoods, Chinatown is much more tightly packed, with its narrower streets rarely allowing for the extension of public outdoor dining setups into the sidewalks or roads. “Outdoor dining costs money, and if an operator is surviving with takeout and delivery, they may not think it is worth the investment to expand outdoors,” Clark said. “Space is needed for outdoor dining, and it is possible that the space available was not conducive to running a restaurant operation.”
When Councilor Flynn reached out to Chinatown’s restaurant owners, “many of them declined, going forward with any plan to open up their restaurant without outdoor seating.” He recalled helping only one individual with applying for the outdoor dining permit, sharing that for the most part, owners weren’t seeking one as “they didn’t think it would be helpful or successful.”
Gu, too, ultimately decided not to pursue a permit application for his restaurant, considering it would not be able to serve hotpot, one of their primary menu offerings, outdoors. “[For] the neighborhood, plus the area that we are able to do, we can’t really do outdoor dining [there] for our cuisine,” he said.
In the meanwhile, recovery for the restaurant industry remains a waiting game. “Obviously, the pandemic numbers are still skyrocketing,” said Councilor Flynn. “But at the appropriate time, I want to make sure that we invite residents and tourists back to Chinatown.”

20201106,Chinatown residents successfully oppose dispensary on Tremont St.,"The voting meeting held on October 11 by the Boston Cannabis Board (BCB), newly created in 2019, was a special one for the Chinatown community in the Greater Boston area. They witnessed a victory over Sanctuary Medicinal – a cannabis dispensary based in the New England area and opened a store in Brookline, MA this year – after having been working towards this result for the past two years.
The BCB denied Sanctuary’s application for a retail recreational cannabis dispensary license on 253-255 Tremont Street, which means “they cannot reapply for one year, and the board stated that they should not look to locate at this location,” wrote Nancy Lo in her email notifying her comrades right after the meeting.
Having been informed about Sanctuary’s intention of opening a store in the Chinatown neighborhood at a community meeting in March 2018, opposition throughout the Chinatown community simmered. A working group within the community voluntarily formed against Sanctuary’s commercial interest. Lo was among them, referring to herself as a long-time Chinatown activist among the group. Her comrade Richard Chang, Head of Josiah Quincy Upper School, considers Lo the “head” of the group, who led “hands and feet” working towards the same goal.
“I feel like before Chinatown was like what Sun Yat-sen called, ‘a plate of sands,’ but now younger generations these years are getting united,” Chang stated in the interview with Sampan. “Regardless of political belief, we work together whenever someone wants to harm the community.”
Over the past two years, Lo other community activists with around 30 community organizations were doing research, collecting data, conducting community meetings and coordinating with related people. Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association of New England (CCBAA) organized a petition drive collecting thousands of signatures from concerned people in the Greater Boston Chinatown community. In the meantime, Lo was monitoring closely the proceedings from BCB and Sanctuary to be ready for the upcoming BCB hearing at any time.
“People that want to open these businesses, they’re just looking to make money, and they’re looking to attract customers from outside of Chinatown,” Lo said. “It’s kind of like, what is the community to get out of this? Nothing.”
Lo told people to make sure that they are offering legitimate reasons against the cannabis store. “You just can’t come out and say, we don’t like marijuana,” she told Sampan. “People voted in favor of legalizing marijuana. That’s not what they want to hear. They want to hear about how it is going to affect the quality of life for people in Chinatown.”
In those letters, opponents against the cannabis store listed specific numbers of elderly housing, daycare facilities and after-school programs surrounding the proposed location. They also talked about issues including pre-existing drug problems, air pollution, children’s asthma and potential traffic jams due to insufficient parking plans from the store.
As proposed by Ken Morin, a parent of two children who attended Josiah Quincy School, the premise needs to be at least 500 feet from a K-12 school facility. Lo and her collaborators personally measured the surroundings of the proposed dispensary location and testified that it would indeed violate this buffer zone requirement.
In Chang’s letter to BCB, he mentioned the history in the 1960s when the city government relocated the adult entertainment industry to Chinatown, bring it ill fame as a red-light district in Boston. “Only in the last ten years has Chinatown started to rehabilitate its public image as the former Combat Zone where all manner of social vices could be indulged,” the former history teacher wrote.
“Instead of the British imperial government enabling British merchants to sell opium in China, we now have the Boston city government enabling outside interests to sell marijuana in Chinatown. The irony of this historic parallel is not lost on Chinese minds,” he wrote.
Summarizing their success, Lo and Chang put emphasis on how unity within the community triumphed. They think it is the strong opposition aggregated by the whole Chinatown that pushed BCB to make the final decision.
Lo encourages the young to believe that everything is possible as long as you keep focused, and to not be afraid to reach out to others for support. “If it was just me going against it, it’s not as strong. When you work with other people, and you collaborate, you are stronger in numbers,” she said.

20201106,Racism and opposition to revised BPS admissions criteria,"On October 22, Boston School Committee Chairman Michael Loconto resigned, after publicly mocking Chinese names during a virtual school committee meeting on October 21. In response to this, Councilor Ed Flynn hosted a virtual meeting to discuss what happened at the meeting.
“This process has also unfortunately highlighted several times that the needs of all Asian immigrant communities are not a priority or respected,” said Councilor Flynn.
The two-hour long meeting had both Cantonese and Mandarin interpretations from beginning to end, to ensure that all attendees were included in the discussion. During the meeting, Councilor Flynn, Superintendent Brenda Cassellius, and Councilor Michael Flaherty, each gave their word to prevent another similar incident from happening. “I just want to express my own deepest regret for what happened last night. And I will work as your Superintendent so that it never happens again,” said Cassellius.
During the meeting, several parents and longtime residents in the community were able to voice their concerns and comment on the incident. They called out racism and lack of language access, and they expressed strong opposition against the proposal to revise admission criteria for Boston Public School’s (BPS) exam schools.
The proposal that was passed on October 21 stated that for the upcoming school year, rather than admitting students based on exam scores, students would be admitted based on their 2019 MCAS scores and use students’ zip codes to ensure diversity. While diversity and inclusion was a unanimous agreement, the proposal and the meeting’s voting process had a lot of problems. A longtime resident of South Boston Mark Mooney said, “The proposed plan that was discussed and approved last night does not achieve is not the right way to do that.”
“If you only admit kids based on zip code, it’s a huge insult, and it really means like this is discrimination. You’re discriminating against Chinese,” said Wu, a community member who opposes the proposed change.
Those who attended the October 21 meeting witnessed a lot of opposition during the public comment time, and yet the proposal was still passed. Jen Lee said, “We had a lot of opposition, but then they didn’t really give enough time to further think about it… So I don’t know whether this vote is equitable, so I was wondering if there’s any way we can re-do it?”
Another parent shared that her son was distraught after learning that the exams were cancelled right before they were supposed to take place. Susan Oh said, “My child asked me, ‘Mom, why did they cancel the exam? We study so hard and we’ve studied for so long to prepare for this exam. Is this fair? How could they do this to us?’”
In response to the Superintendent’s promise to provide language access, Maggie Chen, a parent of two children enrolled in BPS, said, “in her commitment to provide interpretation, I just want to emphasize that it needs to be quality and competent interpretation.” On October 21, despite having interpreters, they were only interpreting the public comments section and did not interpret the first two critical hours of the meeting.
Chen said, “A lot of us parents are new immigrants. We were forced to just hang on to the meeting or a few hours… Because we felt that was the only chance it was our only platform to speak… When it was actually time for names to be called, the host didn’t know how to pronounce our name.”
When their names were called, Chairman Loconto publicly made fun of the names. Eric, an attendee who witnessed the entire eight hour long meeting said, “I was shocked that the chairman laughed at Asian Americans in a public hearing conference.”
Councilor Flaherty outlined the hopes of all those present in the virtual meeting. He said, “The Asian community has made great contributions to our city of Boston, and they should always be appreciated and respected. I will join you in continuing to work alongside you to fight for language access, voting access, and also access to housing and employment opportunities, as well as supporting local businesses.”

20201016,"Mayor talks flu season, eviction moratorium, immigrant services","Mayor Walsh reaffirmed his support in favor of the preliminary injunction blocking U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) fee increases, during an immigrant-serving media roundtable on Thursday, October 1. He also provided updates on housing stability and COVID-19 cases, as flu season starts.
The roundtable was hosted by the Mayor’s Office for Immigrant Advancement (MOIA) and facilitated by its director Yusufi Vali, with guest presentations from Rita Nieves, Interim Executive Director of the Boston Public Health Commission, and Katie Forde, Operations Manager at the Office of Housing Stability.
Vali kicked off the event by briefing around 20 outlets on MOIA’s two summer and fall 2020 programs: the Dreamers’ Fellowship Program for Immigrant Youth and Immigrants Lead Boston. Immigrants Lead Boston is a 12-week course teaching Boston immigrants the civic engagement tools to navigate City government, express concerns to City officials, and advocate for their local communities, especially during the pandemic. For its 18 spots, Immigrants Lead Boston received 110 total applications, with representation from 41 countries of origin, 14 Boston neighborhoods, 37 different language speakers, and ages ranging from 18 to 41.
The Dreamers’ Fellowship Program ran its pilot for 50 youth recipients of DACA. Participants were divided between three nonprofits: the Caribbean Youth Club, Centro Presente, and Brazilian Workers Center. Each of the DREAMers were then given a stipend to support their families with rent, utilities, food, and other household expenses. Vali said, “Most critically, what they [the nonprofits] shared was that, especially at one of our East Boston nonprofits, some of these kids would be the same ones that would be recruited for gangs. Some of them would be getting into selling drugs if they weren’t in these programs.”
Following the updates, Mayor Walsh addressed the Trump administration’s anti-immigration rhetoric, as well as its doubling of the application cost to apply for U.S. citizenship. On September 29, a federal court temporarily blocked that fee increase, which would have raised the immigration application fee from $725 to $1,170, and the naturalization application fee from $640 to $1,160, if filed online. It would cost $1,170, in paper filing on October 2.
“I congratulate the court, applaud them. Citizenship should not be a wealth test, American citizenship, in my opinion, is about what you believe, not what you can pay,” said Walsh. In the wake of the federal injunction, there remains concern that it is only a temporary solution for immigrants worried about high fees, since USCIS and the government may appeal to the Ninth Circuit. Vali said that the Mayor’s Office would put together a more long-term strategy in the coming weeks to prepare for that possibility of the rule coming back into effect. Still, for now, their focus lies on working with Project Citizenship to ensure those who qualify take advantage of the fee waiver and apply now.
Walsh also urged people to respond to the census before the deadline of October 31. This deadline was reinstated, following a lawsuit led by several cities and civil rights groups against the Trump administration for cutting the 2020 census short. This had happened when the administration moved the deadline up a month to the end of September. Trump’s rushed census timeline was described as “certainly a blatant attempt to undercount communities of color and immigrants” by Walsh.
As of the morning of October 1, “only 58.5% of Boston’s households have self-responded,”  according to Ana Vivas, the Deputy Press Secretary for Mayor Walsh.  The actual number could be a little higher because census takers are still going door to door, she said. Walsh expressed that, “But we’re still relatively low in Chinatown. We are under 10 years ago at this point.”
Another area of concern discussed was recent increased COVID-19 activity, in terms of the number of cases and positivity test rates. September 30, the night before the event, Boston moved into the red zone, meaning they have had more than 8 cases per 100,000 residents in the past 14 days. “Right now, we’re at about 8.5 per 100,000 population — roughly 60 cases per day that we’re seeing here in Boston … It’s not a concern of shutting things down at this particular moment. But we are keeping a very close eye on that.”
In-person learning started the same day as the open table, when the COVID positivity rate was still 3.5%. Walsh stipulated that “Keeping our students and teachers and school safe is our number one priority. We are moving forward on a phased-in approach, only if the positivity rating stays below 4%.” Since then, Boston has delayed plans to reopen the city’s schools, after rates climbed higher than 4%.
Rates are exceptionally high in East Boston, which had a 7.7% positivity rate during the week of September 20 to 26. “We’re seeing about half our cases coming from Latino communities,” for which the rate is now about the same as that of African Americans, specified Walsh. “We’re seeing about half of our cases coming from people under the age of 29. Part of that is due to colleges, and part of it is due to people still having parties, large gatherings, and not being safe.”
Rita Nieves, Interim Executive Director of the Boston Public Health Commission, confirmed that as of September 30, 52% of new cases are in residents younger than 29. She highlighted that while younger people tend to have a lower risk for the virus, they do have a greater chance to spread COVID-19 to higher-risk populations, which is particularly worrisome as flu season approaches.
Because different viruses cause COVID-19 and the flu, it is possible to have both at the same time. A test may be required in that case to confirm which one you have due to them sharing similar symptoms. With competing resources, tests, and systems for the flu and COVID-19, Nieves stressed the importance for everyone to do their part in “preventing hospitalizations from the flu by getting vaccinated.” Masking and social distancing behaviors for the coronavirus also help prevent the spread of the flu.
Also quickly approaching is October 17, the end of the moratorium put in place to assist renters economically hit hard by the pandemic. Katie Forde, Operations Manager at the Office of Housing Security, broke down the city’s post eviction moratorium plan into three parts: communications, legal assistance, and financial assistance.
Forde said, “We’re going to send out a mailer to 42,000 plus households that we feel are in high-risk eviction areas before the moratorium ends that explains their rights as tenants. We’ve also redesigned our OHS webpage to make it more user friendly for eviction defense.” The Tenant Rights mailer is in the process of being translated into several languages. As for the legal and financial assistance components, OHS has added two additional attorneys to their nonprofit partners, hired a housing court navigator, as well as planned to host multiple virtual weekly legal clinics for eviction defense and reopen the Rental Relief Fund.
When the moratorium lifts, a federal moratorium, known as the CDC eviction moratorium, will go into effect, known as the CDC eviction moratorium. It remains unknown as of now how the housing court will react to this moratorium. But Forde has an important reminder: “The current federal administration has said that through the end of the year if you have lost work or financial resources due to COVID-19, you cannot be evicted for non-payment of rent, but there’s a kicker — you actually have to fill out the form and give that to your landlord.”

20201002,Committee on City and Neighborhood Services holds hearing for rodent control and illegal dumping in City of Boston,"On September 22, the Boston City Council referred the Committee on City and Neighborhood Services to hold a virtual hearing for Docket #0935 on the subject of pest control and illegal dumping of trash in the City. The hearing was facilitated and sponsored by Councilors Ed Flynn and Liz Breaden.
The goal of the hearing was to discuss the issues and potential solutions to address the rise in recent months of rodents and illegal dumping on the streets. Since a lot of Boston’s downtown neighborhoods have residential and business districts mixed together, it is important to address these issues as a community, outlined Councilor Kenzie Bok.
According to Councilor Flynn, “the CDC has warned that environmental health and rodent control agencies should expect reports of unusual or aggressive rodent behavior due to restaurants and other food sources for rats and rodents closing down during this pandemic.” Illegal dumping is another problem that can attract more rodents and cause other public health issues.
While in many neighborhoods, pests and poor trash disposal have been a perennial problem even before the pandemic, changes in behavior have contributed to the problem. “What happened was the perfect storm,” said Assistant Commissioner from inspectional services department (ISD) Leo Boucher. “We had this awful COVID-19 to begin with, and the quarantines began in March. At the same time as that occurred, spring is a breeding season for rodents.” In addition, people reverted to ordering takeout food, which means there was less commercial trash and more personal trash in residential areas. As a result, rodents migrated to their food source.
The primary problem identified was that the tightly packed city does not allow for proper storage of trash, before it gets picked up by waste trucks. “Trash placed on the street does cause rodents,” said Boucher. “Our primary focus is proper storage of trash, proper storage of that food waste.” At ISD, they have been finding ways to resolve things through public education. Boucher said, “Our inspectors are focusing on making sure that folks understand how they can prevent rodent activity in the neighborhoods.”
“Every receptacle is required to have tight fitting covers,” said Boucher. There are also ‘zones’ that determine the type of waste disposal that is required. For instance, “If that building is zoned as a church, they’re required to secure private pickup. They’re not eligible for city pickup,” said Boucher.
However, due to the tightly packed nature of the city and intermingling of residential and business districts, proper trash storage is scarce.
A panelist at the meeting, Asian American Civic Association’s (AACA) COO Edward Hsieh said, “Chinatown is one of the areas that does suffer severely from lack of space to put bins. And so there has to be some sort of investment, some sort of innovation to make it happen.” Hsieh proposed a solution similar to that of BID – Downtown Boston Business Improvement District. The BID refers to the area in Downtown Crossing and Boston’s Financial District’s constituents coming together to fund regular cleanups, other programs and services to meet area needs.
Hsieh said, “That’s something that we are very interested in exploring here. Obviously, Chinatown is not as affluent as Downtown Crossing or the financial district. So if the city council could work with us to find ways to either fund that or to allow the neighborhood to put into that in a contract out on its own, instead, or it could be an innovation district, too.”
CEO of AACA Mary Chin added, “Chinatown is unique but not the only place in Boston that has a real problem with space. We really need to be tougher on the owners and landlords of our site, because they need to do what the law requires, which is to take care of their tenants. They need to make sure that there are barrels for their tenants.” In addition, Chin stated, we must “have our community do our part, which is to change our behavior, educate ourselves, and then enforce ourselves.”
In terms of enforcement, Boucher encourages people to report improper trash disposal through their 311 hotline. “That 311 complaint automatically gets generated to ISD and automatically goes into my queue of complaints,” he said.
In a statement made by another panelist, the President of the Allston Civic Association, Anthony D’Isidoro said, “Also, let’s not be derelict in our duty, which forces residents to take matters into their own hands and disperse poison and traps in an irresponsible manner, endangering people and other forms of life. The city needs to step up and recognize that there are consequences to the public policy they continue to pursue. A proportional and consistent response is required to ensure quality of life issues will never take a backseat. And we value the health and safety of every resident who calls Boston their home.”
In her closing remark, Councilor Kenzie Bok said, “The onus is on us to kind of think about what we can do to step things up.”

20201002,"Emerson, Tufts, and residents address disturbances at testing sites in Chinatown","College COVID-19 testing sites cause concern for residents of Chinatown. (Photo courtesy of Carey Lin/Sampan)
The office of Councilor Ed Flynn convened another meeting on September 15, with the purpose of communicating about two testing sites in Chinatown. At this meeting, representatives from testing sites responded to complaints from residents about long lines forming outside the testing sites. Attendees also addressed the issues of penalties for conduct violations.
“How would you feel if I open up a COVID-19 testing site directly across the street from where you live? How would you feel? Would you feel safe?” a resident asked all attendees. She works, lives and shops in Chinatown. She has young kids and elderly relatives, who have been trying to avoid going on the streets because of their fears. “I really wonder whether you could actually implement better measures to prevent lines from queuing up,” she said.
One testing site is located at the original Tufts bookstore location, based at 116 Harrison Avenue, while the other is at 171 Harrison Avenue, a Tufts Medical Center space. The testing site at the bookstore space is open for university students of Emerson and Tufts, while the second site is open to the public. Rebecca Deusser, Chief of Staff at Tufts Medical Center, described what had happened that caused big lines over the past week. One problem was that the door was locked when the building was opening, at the 116 Harrison Avenue location, and so staff had no access to it, which caused a delay. Another delay was related to a fire drill in the building, during which people were evacuated, she said.
As for the two lines that appeared on the day of the meeting, Deusser said, one was at 8 am when the facility opened. There were six people in line, and it was resolved in one minute. Then around 1:15 pm, they had a line of about 12 people, a problem that was also resolved within one minute.
Deusser further explained how they resolved the lines. Their staffers talked to individuals who were in line and ensured that they were supposed to be there. The staff then brought the individuals into the center so that they could be processed faster, she said.
“I’ve worked in Chinatown for a number of years. I’m on-site frequently, I feel very safe in the neighborhood myself, but I also understand the fears associated with COVID and people in line,” Deusser said. “We’re committed for both testing sites to do all we can every day to minimize the length of the lines. We continue to work on it week by week, day by day, to balance the lines and the need for continued testing, as we are combating the virus.”
According to Deusser, over the past less than four weeks, the testing site located at the original Tufts bookstore, has tested almost 10,000 students. “By and large, our experience has been very few lines,” she said. “And when there were lines, we were able to resolve them relatively quickly.”
“I’m not defending if there’s a line,” said Peggy Ings, Vice President of Government and Community Relations at Emerson College. She said she just wanted to point out that the line looks longer from a bystander’s perspective, because people are lining up with six feet in between each other, to observe the rules for social distancing. “I think that’s what happens at times,” she said.
Erik Muurisepp, Assistant Vice President of Campus Life from Emerson, responded that Emerson has a community compact for all students studying in person, when asked if students would receive penalties for violating safety protocols. Towards the violations that are “egregious, repetitive and very serious,” the school will act swiftly, through community standards.

20201002,City of Boston supports lawsuit against USCIS fee increase,"On September 17, the City of Boston announced an amicus brief for a lawsuit against a policy to increase citizenship application costs and eliminate the fee waiver. Announced by Mayor Martin J. Walsh, the brief is in support of a lawsuit by Project Citizenship, a Boston nonprofit that provides free legal services to Massachusetts immigrants. The City of Boston led this amicus brief on behalf of 34 cities, counties, and municipal agencies. (*33 cities and counties + USCM + MAPC + Boston — so 36 in total. https://www.boston.gov/news/boston-marks-us-constitution-and-citizenship-day-leading-amicus-brief-against-uscis-fee
The proposed United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) rule, which would go into effect October 2, would nearly double the naturalization application fee – increasing it from $725 to $1,170 – and abolish the application fee waiver. (*The elimination is for almost everyone, with a few exceptions.)  The Department of Homeland Security hopes this fee increase will recover operational costs.
The amicus brief from the City of Boston calls this policy a “wealth test” that will have “a profoundly negative effect on municipalities and their immigrant populations.”
“People come to the United States for a better life for themselves and their families, whether that’s 400 years ago or yesterday,” Mayor Walsh said in an email. “This new rule creates a wealth test to be an American.”
*While Project Citizenship’s lawsuit has not been heard in court yet, three lawsuits in three different states are in action – California, New York, and Massachusetts. On Sept 29, a federal judge in California ruled against the fee increase, consequently delaying the fee increase from its original start date on Oct 2.
“Citizenship has always been a bipartisan issue,” said Yusufi Vali, Director of Mayor’s Office for Immigrant Advancement (MOIA). “Cities across the country, whether blue, purple, or red agreed with this mayor and our team’s stance that citizenship is a belief and commitment to America. It’s not something to be reserved to only those who can afford it.”
The City worked with the law company Latham & Watkins to draft the brief pro bono. After the core of the brief was prepared, it was circulated to other cities to sign.
The brief includes information from cities about how the rule would impact its population. For Boston, 30,000 residents are eligible for citizenship, and over 12,000 are eligible for fee waivers. This law would also frustrate efforts by cities to promote naturalization. Boston, for instance, hosts an annual “Citizenship Day” with Project Citizenship to assist immigrants in preparing citizenship applications. Since its start in 2014, over 1,800 (now updated to more than 2,600) applicants have applied for citizenship through the program, with more than 58% from 2019 alone also applying for fee waivers. (*This year that number is up to 65%.)
Despite the amicus brief, Vali still encourages prospective citizens to apply as soon as possible.
“People should prioritize getting their citizenship before October 2,” Vali said. “My hope is that if the injunction is granted, then people will have the opportunity to apply at the lower fee and be eligible for the fee waiver, post-October 2.”
*Editor’s Note: On September 29, a federal court in California temporarily blocked the USCIS fee increases, so application costs did not change on October 2
*The article has been edited on October 5, 2020 for accuracy.

20201002,Boston Police Reform Task Force hold online listening session,"Complying with the wave of nationwide protests against police brutality, Boston manifested its actions in the Boston Police Reform Task Force, convened by Mayor Martin Walsh in June.
The 11-member task force — composed of community leaders, advocates, members of the legal profession, and law enforcement members — reviewed the Boston Police Department’s (BPD) current policies and procedures, and drafted a report with recommendations for reform. During the final online public listening session on Sept. 22, members from the task force first reviewed and explained the report’s basic content. Following that, 14 attendees gave feedback for about 45 minutes, half of the listening session.
They engaged voices from the community and sought multiple rounds of public input. The task force continued receiving written comments until Sep. 25 through their website. The final recommendations will be submitted to the mayor and made available to the public in early October, said former U.S. Attorney and chair of the task force Wayne Budd in the listening session.
The report focuses on five main aspects: the creation of an independent Office of Police Accountability and Transparency (OPAT); the formalization and expansion of the BPD’s commitment to diversity and inclusion; the expansion of the use of the body-worn camera program; the enhancement of the BPD’s Use of Force policies; and the adoption of practices that could maximize public access to BPD records and data.
According to the report, OPAT would be an independent body from the police department, holding full investigatory and subpoena power. Replacing the current Civilian Ombudsman Oversight Panel (Co-Op), “OPAT would continue to review and resolve complaints made against the BPD’s Internal Investigation team, but it would also review and resolve civilian complaints,” the report wrote. It would also “investigate current and historic disparate treatment of Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) officers in the BPD and publish reports on the BPD’s progress on its various reform goals.”
To promote diversity and inclusion within the BPD and across Boston, the report added that BPD should develop a Diversity & Inclusion Unit. The task force proposed prioritizing the recruitment and hiring of BIPOC officers, as well as creating a preference for Boston Public School graduates.
Jamarhl Crawford, an activist and a member of the task force, said in the listening session that the BPD’s Use of Force policies were not necessarily the problem. “The problem was what happens if you violate those policies?” he explained. “So we try to deal with basically appropriate measures of accountability and transparency, which dealt with a lot of reporting, and that’s where the data is tied in.”
Attendees also brought up the issue of data transparency. They emphasized they would like to know how to access body camera recordings and police logs when needed.
Multiple attendees addressed the need for expertise in the BPD team related to domestic violence, mental illness, substance abuse and homelessness. With the involvement of trained professionals, BPD could remove some of their responsibilities when dealing with those special issues, as attendees suggested.
“When police are called to a situation where a person with SMI (serious mental illness) is psychotic, hallucinating, or otherwise in crisis and not thinking clearly, they should be accompanied by highly trained individuals to help de-escalate, so there will be less chance that force will be used,” one attendee said in the session. “They may have some training about SMI, but they are not social workers or other professionals with standard training.”
Another buzzword of the listening session was “time frame”. No matter if it is about civilian complaints or a public record request, the issue needs to be addressed in a timely manner, attendees proposed. “A process can take no more than X amount of months,” one attendee said. “Whatever the time frame is, it’s been found that in most governmental practices that really helps bring the issues to close.”

20201002,Immigrants face barriers to voting rights in upcoming election,"By Shira Laucharoen and Mandy Sun
With the 2020 presidential election approaching, political participation and civic engagement are more crucial than ever. According to the Pew Research Center, Asian Americans are the fastest growing body of eligible voters out of the United States’ major ethnic and racial groups. In the Greater Boston area, advocates and organizers are working to increase voter activity among Asian Americans, while addressing the barriers that some may still continue to encounter.
Immigrant voters in the Asian American community still face challenges in the voting process, such as difficulty with language, for those who are not native English speakers. In 2014, Governor Deval Patrick signed legislation into law, permanently demanding translations in Chinese and Vietnamese for precincts where there was a significant population of speakers of these languages. This was a step forward, said Karen Chen, Executive Director of the Chinese Progressive Association (CPA). Previously, there was a “sunset provision” on the original plan, meaning it would expire after a specific date until further action was taken. This year, according to the Press Office of the City of Boston, the mail in presidential ballots will be available in Chinese and Vietnamese in all precincts.
Elderly voters may also experience difficulties, said Chen, as they may have visibility impairments or shaky hands. Lydia Lowe, a board member of the Chinese Progressive Political Action, said that elderly voters were once coerced and told whom to vote for at the polls. Within Chinatown, there had been cases of voter fraud. Individuals would go to senior housing buildings under the pretense of assisting elders with their ballots, only to manipulate them into voting for a specific candidate.
Today, the coronavirus presents new complications. Local organizations have made efforts to encourage voting in the Asian American community despite these challenges.
“Even with bilingual ballots, a lot of the elderly can’t read it because the characters are too small,” said Lowe. “A lot of the elderly have difficulty filling out any kind of a form, let alone a ballot, the return envelope, and signatures. And then the fact that we have the pandemic is really difficult, because where are they going to get the help? If somebody comes to their door and says, ‘I’m here to help you,’ they’re going to take that help. It does make them vulnerable.”
Other organizations, like the Asian American Resource Workshop (AARW) and the CPA, will be running phone banks, making sure that prospective voters have access to mail in voting and know their rights. Carolyn Chou, Executive Director of AARW, said that she is hoping residents will become more civically engaged, even in the face of barriers.
“It’s kind of about connecting these big moments, like national elections, where everyone’s talking about voting, to what’s happening in our neighborhoods and communities,” said Chou. “We’re talking about issues we’re organizing around, like gentrification and housing, immigration, really talking to folks about the issues and using the election as an opportunity to see what residents care about.”
In the city of Malden, voting centers have reported acts of discrimination and noncompliance to section 203, which guarantees bilingual voting assistance through ballots, poll workers, announcements and materials. In hopes of tackling this issue, the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund has been monitoring 203-covered jurisdictions. In June, they co-wrote a letter with Greater Boston Legal Services (GBLS) to be sent to the city over the various acts of discrimination during the November 2019 and March 2020 elections.
In the letter, they stated their concern that 70% of the poll sites they observed did not provide any interpreters and translated materials.
GBLS’s Asian Outreach Unit has been working closely with community organizations like CPA and Greater Malden Asian American Community Coalition (GMAACC) in the past few years. In particular, they are working to make sure Chinese speaking residents in Malden have equal and easier access to the ballot. Collaborating with the mayor and other community organizations, the city has made drastic changes.
Alexander Milvae, a lawyer from the GBLS Asian Outreach Unit remarked that, “We’ve been pleased by the progress the city has made. They’ve hired trilingual elections department staff members, fluent in Cantonese, Mandarin, and English to work in the city clerk’s office. They’ve increased the number of bilingual poll workers and have committed to have all candidates names transliterated for next year’s [mayoral] election.”
The November presidential election is a critical one, where there will be a lot at stake for many voters, said Lowe. She hopes that people of color will play an important role in determining its outcome, she added. According to Chen, this could be an important time for immigrant voters, many of whom may not have had the chance to vote in their home countries.

20200918,Lifting up Chinatown through Creative Placemaking,"ACDC’s Think Chinatown 2017: Tied Together by a Thousand Threads Mural (Photo courtesy of Mandy Sun.)
Walking through the streets of Chinatown, you may notice colorful murals and beautiful structures decorating the neighborhood.  These pieces are known as ‘creative placemaking’, a practice used in community development and urban planning since the 1960s. Art is used as a strategy in strengthening local historically disinvested places to cultivate culture. Simply put, residents gather together within the community and become their own artists as they revitalize unused spaces or create public art.
Successful creative placemaking leverages existing creative potential. Residents can become artists and storytellers themselves. As the neighborhood looks and becomes increasingly cared for through placemaking, opportunities are created for local small businesses. Additionally, it brings the community together and empowers them to take ownership of their space. This allows them to see their own space in a different light and creates a movement for positive change.
Chinatown has a long history of engaging its residents to public art. In the 1970s, members of the community participated in the mural of the Sampan boat, which depicted the historical experience of Chinese immigrants. Chinatown now faces a new foe. Gentrification and displacement are disrupting the community and pushing out long-time locals, warranting for community organizations, such as Pao Arts Center and Asian Community Development Corporation (ACDC) to push for creative placemaking in their own programs.
Before the pandemic, ACDC youth leaders hosted Saturplay, a monthly Saturday event that features arts & craft tables and pop-up libraries in their creative and safe play-space for children. Youth managers saw how they built a better community through placemaking, stating, “As the youth who run the event, we get to know the residents and community members better while strengthening our project management, communication and leadership skills.” They hope to use this creative placemaking to push for a permanent play-space in Chinatown.
ACDC was also directly involved in the mural painted on Philips Corner, called “Tied Together by a Thousand Threads”. This was started as an ideas lab, called Think Chinatown, where residents can brainstorm ideas to transform public spaces. Hoping to share a story of a Chinatown resident, they found Yvonne Ng. Community artist Shaina Luo was in charge of translating Yvonne’s vision into a painting. Shaina had been incredibly inspired by how Jeena, the youth program director then, centered community voices. She wanted to do the same in her art, as she saw her personal role in community art as “contributing technical art skills to help bring community visions to life.” She rarely puts her own perspective in murals. This mural became a multigenerational and multi-program effort as BCNC youth, AVOYCE youth, Yvonne’s family, community members, partook in the vision or in the painting.
While Shaina serves as a community artist by translating visions and thoughts into drawings and pictures, other community artists create their art themselves and alter it depending on community input. Regardless of the artist’s course of action, the community residents will always have a voice.
While it has incredible potential in improving a community, a lack of community voices could result in an unwanted or controversial art piece. Additionally, if the art is not celebrated or remembered, it could lose its purpose.
Creative placemaking is prevalent during COVID now more than ever. As social-distance guidelines isolate individuals from one another, creative placemaking reminds us of our shared experiences and unwavering community.

20200918,“We Love Boston Chinatown” revitalizes the community,"Boston Hurricane team comes together to help out the community. (Photo courtesy of Gilbert Ho.)
When the COVID outbreak created fears in the community and businesses were hurting, Mayor Marty Walsh made a #LoveBostonChinatown Small Business Bingo social media campaign that got people to visit Chinatown for dim sum, pastries, public art, and more.
This support for the community brought more attention to the “Love Your Block program,” which is now the “We Love Boston Chinatown” campaign. Together the community is dedicated to revitalizing businesses and supporting local artists and organizations. Events were held in hopes of beautifying the neighborhood and reviving the impacts left by COVID-19 along with the years of resilience of anti-Asian xenophobia persistence.
In August, the Chinatown Main Street (CMS) and Boston Chinatown Neighborhood Center decided to get together with volunteers from the Boston Hurricanes volleyball organization, GE aeronautical engineers team, Chinese Freemason Athletic club, Boston Chinatown residents and many others to clean up the streets of Chinatown.
CMS Board Member, Gilbert Ho said “we were spreading our volunteers in small groups to maintain social distancing to clean all the streets and clean up trash.” Amid the fears of COVID-19, everyone was willing to come together while socially-distanced to clean up the community because there were areas that needed some upkeep – areas included Chinatown Park, Reggie Wong Park, and Resident’s Lab.
On the weekend of September 13-14, there was a virtual 5k/1-mile run event organized by the BCNC’s Bamboo Circle. It brought the community together in a socially-distanced environment while supporting a cause to revitalize and strengthen Chinatown. The race entry was free and donations were optional, to encourage everyone to participate.
The fact that it is a virtual run allows runners to go at their own pace and allows them to find an area that best suits them without closing off streets. The map was planned so that it took place on wider streets like Kneeland Street, Surface Artery, and around the Boston Common.
With a lack of outdoor events, i.e. the Lantern Festival and August Moon Festival being cancelled, this event hopes to bring everyone together in an outdoor setting, with the ability to see each other’s progress virtually. The goal of the run was to raise at least $5000 by September 13th, and the donations would go towards the BCNC’s services.
Over $10k worth of funding was raised thanks to matched donations by organizations and teams. The winners of the race were also awarded gift certificates to use at small local businesses. There were 192 runners of all ages coming from Virgina, California, and all over Greater Boston. Due to the great turnout, Eng hopes to establish this annual event and for it to be an in-person event in the future with the Chinatown Gate as the finish line.

20200918,The Greenway in Chinatown: Updates from Greenway Conservancy,"New signage to honor Mary Soo Hoo. (Photo courtesy of the Greenway Conservancy.)
It has been a busy month in Chinatown on The Greenway, and the Greenway Conservancy is excited to announce several updates on signage, public art, and community collaborations.
The Greenway Conservancy this month added new signage on The Greenway. Alongside the Chinatown Viewing Garden, new signage has been added to the fenceline with information on the garden and the plants within. In Mary Soo Hoo Park, historical signage has been added to honor the park’s namesake, community leader and organizer Mary R. Soo Hoo.
The Greenway Conservancy is proud to partner with We Love Boston Chinatown, a resilience campaign led by a collective of Chinatown non-profit organizations, businesses, residents, and city officials to reactivate and heal Chinatown’s economic and social fabric.
Support your favorite local businesses and bring your take out to The Greenway! Taking place on select Thursdays in September, Take-out Thursdays encourage residents and visitors to buy food from local restaurants while listening to live music from 12p-1p at Auntie Kay and Uncle Frank Chin Park on The Greenway. Musical performances will also occur on Thursday 9/24 from 6:30p-7:30p and Saturday 9/26 from 11a-1p. All performances are part of Experience Chinatown, a celebration of the rich cultural fabric of Boston Chinatown through free creative activities for all, organized by the Pao Arts Center. We Love Boston Chinatown and Experience Chinatown include signage and barricades to encourage physical distancing and face coverings. These performances are weather dependent and Pao Arts Center will stream virtually in the event of poor weather. Performances will follow Commonwealth of Massachusetts guidelines; if a crowd begins to form, the performance may be temporarily paused.
Last week, the Conservancy announced the much-anticipated new public art installation, Lantern Stories, by local artist Yu-Wen Wu, on The Greenway. Lantern Stories will be on display through the fall, located above the plaza on The Greenway in Chinatown. Celebrating Boston’s Chinatown community, Yu-Wen Wu designed 30 lanterns to illuminate the history of immigration, the community’s culture, and its resiliency.
Thank you to our community jury partners, Josiah Quincy Elementary School, Pao Arts Center / Boston Chinatown Neighborhood Coalition, AVOYCE / Asian Community Development Corporation, Chinatown Main Street, City of Boston Arts Commission, the Greenway Public Art Advisory Group and many other community members and business owners who participated in the story sharing workshops and conversations with Yu-Wen Wu.
The Conservancy has continued to move forward with a lighting study for The Greenway in Chinatown and will be hosting a virtual community update meeting on Thursday, October 8, to give an update on upcoming lighting and infrastructure improvements on The Greenway in Chinatown. This update follows our community input meeting and online survey in February 2020 to solicit community feedback. Funding for the design work was provided by the Greenway Business Improvement District (BID) and the Conservancy has successfully fundraised from the Massachusetts Cultural Facilities Fund and the Greenway BID for a first phase of lighting construction in 2021. You can learn more about this event on The Greenway website and register in advance; translation services will be provided.

20200918,Celebrating 100 Years of Voting—But Not for Asian American Women,"This August, Americans celebrated the 100 year anniversary of the 19th Amendment—an anniversary that excludes many Chinese Americans.
While the 19th Amendment granted women the right to vote, many Asian American women were denied citizenship due to laws like the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act.
It wasn’t until the 1952 McCarran-Walter Act that all Asian Americans could vote. This law allowed people of Asian ancestry to become citizens, thereby giving them the right to vote.
Sixty-eight years later, Asian American political participation still lags. In 2017, 29% of the Quincy population was Asian American. Yet, Asian Americans only made up 16% of the city’s registered voters. This gap reflects two factors: lack of citizenship for many Asian Americans and apathy towards the political process.
Beyond voting, Asian Americans also lack representation among elected officials, a problem that troubles Tiffani Sykhammountry, executive director of the Asian American Women’s Political Initiative (AAWPI).
The AAWPI is a political leadership organization that places young women—from prospective politicos to physical therapy majors—in Massachusetts State House internships to learn about politics and community activism.
Asian Americans make up nearly 7% of Massachusetts’ population, with higher proportions living in Boston and surrounding towns. Yet, when AAWPI was founded in 2009, less than 1% of state legislators across the country were Asian American women.
AAWPI targets women in their political education efforts because of their role in the Asian American Pacific Islander community, often holding collective power and influence.
“We wholeheartedly believe that in order for Asian American women to be more involved, to change what we see as an unreflective system, we need more women in politics.”
Further, to Sykhammountry, this political literacy is especially important to Asian American immigrants or children of immigrants.
“It can be scary for people to enter politics. It’s a difficult system to understand if you’re not born into it,” Sykhammountry, a child of immigrants herself, said. “We have to teach our communities to advocate for ourselves. If the privilege is not utilized, laws will be decided without us.”
“We want to get people into these pipelines. You have to understand the system in order to disrupt it,” Sykhammountry said.
AAWPI aims to equip Asian American women with political knowledge to change whichever field they enter. Following their internship with AAWPI, some alumni make careers out of politics. Others advocate “from the outside” by participating in issue-based advocacy organizations.
This election cycle features a historic representation of women on the ballot, both on the national and local level.
Still, according to Sykhammountry, Asian American voting history should contextualize today’s voting.
“Knowing your history is powerful. Because of the model minority myth and the way we exist in white America, we must learn our history and constantly unpack what we’re told,” Sykhammountry said. “The more people that realize how recently we got the right to vote, the more they don’t take it for granted.”

20200904,Citizenship Applications Encouraged Ahead of USCIS Fee Increase,"By Christina Tuttle
Citizenship Day hosted by Project Citizenship in partnership with MOIA helps prospective citizens fill out immigration paperwork. (Photo Courtesy of Leise Jones)
On October 2, United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) will increase the immigration application fee from $725 to $1,170. USCIS also plans to eliminate the fee waiver for low income residents.
“We see this as just another strategy by the federal government to make citizens unwelcome in this country,” said Melanie Torres, Interim Executive Director of Project Citizenship. Project Citizenship is a nonprofit providing free legal services for 2,000 Massachusetts immigrants per year. 
On August 17, Project Citizenship sued the Department of Homeland Security and USCIS for this plan, claiming it discriminates against low-income immigrants. 73% of Project Citizenship’s clients are low-income.
“This is a blatant wealth test for citizenship and a major threat to our mission. We don’t anticipate many of our clients being able to afford the fee,” Torres said.
“Specifically for the Chinese community, this is not always an easy decision. Immigrants have to give up Chinese citizenship,” Torres said. “On top of that, having to pay an exorbitant fee to naturalize is a difficult decision.”
Torres also emphasized the timing of this new fee change.
“This is another strategy to make this country unwelcome to a large portion of the population and the people we serve. This is part of a bigger plan, and it’s not a surprise that it’s happening in front of the 2020 election.”
Last year, 440 people applied for naturalization.   (Photo Courtesy of Leise Jones)
Every year, Project Citizenship partners with the Mayor’s Office for Immigrant Advancement (MOIA) to host Citizenship Day, a large-scale event helping prospective citizens fill out immigration paperwork. Last year, 440 people applied for naturalization at the event. Nearly 60% of those applicants were eligible for a fee waiver. Yusufi Vali, Director of MOIA, anticipates the impacts of the USCIS fee change to be more dramatic. 
“Everyone affected by this policy came to the country through appropriate means. All of this administration’s anti-immigration policies have been about preserving power by disenfranchising the people unlikely to vote for their party,” Vali said. “So many people in the city have benefitted from this program. That’s why we’re pushing back.”
Torres also framed efforts to limit citizenship as a problem for electing representative public officials.
“More broadly, this affects our whole country. There are lots of efforts to make the government more representative of the people in it. This keeps certain kinds of immigrants from positions of power,” Torres said.
A child of immigrants himself, Vali emphasized the need for a new administration that supports immigration. 
“Voting is really important. Having a new administration will make a huge difference on a whole host of immigration matters,” Vali said. “It’s important to understand the broader challenges we will continue to face. If this administration wins in November, we will see more and more rules targeted at people of color, through immigration restrictions preventing them from being civically active in the country.” 
Torres and Vali encourage prospective immigrants to fill out their applications as soon as possible to avoid the October 2 fee increase.

20200904,Recover Better Together － Taiwan can help,"Contributed by:
Jaushieh Joseph Wu
Minister of Foreign Affairs
Republic of China (Taiwan)
In 2020, the world has been hit by an unprecedented public health crisis, with the effects of COVID-19 being felt across every aspect of people’s lives. This year also marks the 75th anniversary of the signing of the Charter of the United Nations—the mission statement that stands at the very heart of the inclusive multilateralism the world needs so much at the present moment. Now more than ever, the global community must make a concerted effort to forge the better and more sustainable future called for by the UN and its Member States. Taiwan is ready, willing and able to be a part of these efforts.
With less than 500 confirmed cases and seven deaths, Taiwan has defied predictions and successfully contained COVID-19. We managed this without lockdowns; schools were only closed for two weeks in February. Baseball games also restarted in April. Initially, cardboard cutouts stood in for the crowds, but by mid-July games were back in full swing, attended by as many as 10,000 spectators.
This has all come in no small part due to Taiwan’s quick response measures, including the establishment of a Central Epidemic Command Center, the implementation of stringent border controls and quarantine procedures, and transparent information-sharing. We also took swift action to ensure an adequate stock of medical supplies for our world-class health care system. And after making sure we had enough supplies to look after our own people, we started providing medical equipment and supplies to other countries in serious need. By the end of June, Taiwan had donated 51 million surgical masks, 1.16 million N95 masks, 600,000 isolation gowns, 35,000 forehead thermometers, and other medical materials to more than 80 countries, including the United States, Taiwan’s diplomatic allies, and European nations. We have also joined forces with like-minded democracies to explore the development of rapid test kits, medicines, and vaccines. Working together for the greater good is how the world will defeat COVID-19.
In the Declaration on the Commemoration of the Seventy-fifth Anniversary of the United Nations, governments and heads of state acknowledge that only by working together in solidarity can we end the pandemic and effectively tackle its consequences. They thus pledge to make the UN more inclusive and to leave no one behind as the world looks to recover from the pandemic. Similarly, in remarks at the High-level Segment of the UN Economic and Social Council on “Multilateralism after COVID-19: what kind of UN do we need at the 75th anniversary?” in July, UN Secretary-General António Guterres said that networked, inclusive, and effective multilateralism would aid global efforts to promote recovery and the continued implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We cannot agree more. However, this vision seems lacking when Taiwan—one of the world’s model democracies and a success story in containing the current pandemic—continues to be barred from taking part in and exchanging experiences and information with the UN system.
Even as the pandemic has made the international community acutely aware of Taiwan’s unjust and discriminatory exclusion from the World Health Organization and the UN system, the People’s Republic of China (PRC) continues to press the UN to use an erroneous interpretation of the 1971 UN General Assembly Resolution 2758 (XXVI) as the legal basis for blocking Taiwan. The fact is that this resolution does not address the issue of Taiwan’s representation in the UN, nor does it state that Taiwan is part of the PRC. In fact, Taiwan is not, nor has it ever been, a part of the PRC. Our President and legislature are directly elected by the people of Taiwan. Moreover, border controls instituted during the pandemic offer further evidence to counter the PRC’s false claims. The UN must recognize that only Taiwan’s democratically elected government can represent its 23.5 million people; the PRC has no right to speak on Taiwan’s behalf.
Not having Taiwan’s input in the UN is a loss to the global community, and will hamper Member States’ efforts to regain normalcy and implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in full and on time. By drawing on its outstanding work on the SDGs, Taiwan can help countries better recover from the disruption caused by the pandemic. Our economy has proven resilient: the Asian Development Bank forecast that Taiwan’s economic performance in 2020 would be the best among the Four Asian Tigers—the only one to show positive growth. Moreover, many of our SDG indicators—including gender equality, economic growth, clean water and sanitation, reduced inequality, and good health and wellbeing—have reached levels comparable to OECD countries. Our ongoing efforts to implement the SDGs coupled with our proven pandemic response put Taiwan in a much better position than most to help the global community in tackling the ongoing challenges facing humanity.
In fact, Taiwan has long been assisting its partner countries in Africa, Asia, the Caribbean, Latin America, and the Pacific with their development goals in such areas as clean energy, waste management, and disaster prevention. So we are already able to help—yet we could do that much more if given the chance to participate in UN activities, meetings, and mechanisms.
Unfortunately, the 23.5 million people of Taiwan are denied any access to UN premises. Taiwanese journalists and media outlets are also denied accreditation to cover UN meetings. This discriminatory policy stems from the wrongful claims of and pressure from an authoritarian state, and contravenes the principle of universality and equality upon which the UN was founded.
“We the peoples of the United Nations determined . . . to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights . . . [and] the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small”—thus begins the UN Charter. The ideal of upholding human rights and fundamental freedoms for all laid out in this text must not remain empty words. As it looks ahead to the next 75 years, it is never too late for the UN to welcome Taiwan’s participation.

20200904,Parents Face Choices as Early Education Centers and Out-of-School Programs Work to Reopen,"By Edward Hsieh

While the whole country struggles to attain some level of normalcy, many parents and early educators are facing the daunting task of continuing to provide needed care for the youngest among us. Governor Baker closed daycares and out-of-school programs statewide on March 23, only allowing certain centers to stay open as Exempt Emergency Child Care programs to service essential workers. In July, daycare centers that opted not to stay open under the extra restrictions placed on exempt centers only recently started reopening. The road to reopening has not been easy and will continue to be rocky going forward.
Centers in the process of reopening face strict social distancing rules that impact the level of staffing, as well as additional safety protocols that alter logistics. “We have had to reduce staff from 20 down to 8, and all the teachers have to wear PPE: face shields when changing diapers, long sleeve smocks that have to be changed if they get soiled or wet,” said Jeanne McKenna, Director of Buds and Blossoms Early Education and Child Care Center in Chinatown. “Our teachers have had to learn new ways of changing diapers. They have to wear a face shield and gloves when changing a diaper, and after disposing of the diaper, take off their gloves, wash the child’s hands with their hands, then put on new gloves. We had some teachers that wanted to wash the children’s hands with gloves on, until we explained to them this is the new rule.”
McKenna highlights that while the social distancing requirements have restricted her from bringing back all her teachers, it has forced her to buy new equipment and increase non-teacher staff previously not needed. The Department of Early Education and Care (EEC) requires centers to have a check-in process where a staff runner brings the children from the door to their assigned room. Runners, in the past, could be used as floaters to cover a classroom when a teacher needed a break or had lunch, but under the new EEC guidelines, a runner can only cover one room to prevent cross contamination.

Kwong Kow Chinese School, KKCS, faced similar changes in requirements when reopening its summer camps this July. EEC reduced the number of children per teacher down from 13 children per one teacher and one assistant to 10 children per. “Manpower issue. During the summer, we used to have 100 kids so planned for 100, but we had 28 in person and over 20 offsite. We had plenty of staff, so no issue,” said Felix Lui, Board Member, KKCS. “KKCS just heard this weekend that we are ok to open [for the school year]. In the past, we could host kids after school. Now, we can take care of kids during school hours.”
Starting September 21, Boston Public School students will return to class with staggered in-person and remote days. KKCS will host students from Josiah Quincy Elementary School in person and online on the days that those students are doing remote schoolwork. “The summer programs prepared KKCS for the September session. Unlike other sites, we already have the site plan and the daily screening and social distancing experience,” said Jenny Lui, Executive Director, KKCS.  Felix Lui added, “we did [summer camp] safe, and without any incidents. With this experience, we are confident we can move to the next phase on September 21.”
One parent that has children at both Buds and Blossoms and KKCS highlighted the importance of giving our children opportunities to socially interact with some structure. “While my husband and I are fortunate to work from home, we found the remote learning schedule of three children hard to juggle,” said Linda See, “and the children were sad at home and getting depressed. They were used to doing a lot in Chinatown, but when we switched to remote Zoom sessions, about a month in, you could see them become withdrawn.”
See sent her children to both Buds and Blossoms and KKCS’s summer camp when those centers reopened. She said that “it is very hard for a little kid to learn remotely. At home, it is very hard for a child to focus and stay engaged. My kids interact with me differently than a teacher, so having them with a teacher is important.”
Parents still face decisions in the coming month as schools reopen. (Photo Courtesy of Buds and Blossoms)
See has been “happy with KKCS and Buds and Blossoms safety.” But she worries that the coming shift to remote and hybrid learning at the Boston Public Schools “exacerbates inequity. There are homes where there is no one at home to help with the remote learning.” She mentions with sadness, but not surprise, that at a recent public school meeting for Chinese speakers, one woman asked “if she could go to work and leave her child at home, if she chose fully remote learning for her child. She was desperate. She probably has to go to work to earn money, or maybe has an essential role.”
While more options are coming online, with some early education centers waiting the requisite 60 day licensing period to be approved, others may not be returning. Lui pointed out that the Boston Public Schools will no longer lend space to community organizations, “which will be a big impact on the community.” See also questions “from a financial perspective how long centers can stay open under these current restrictions.”
Many parents will face decisions in the coming month, as schools work to reopen and early education centers and out-of-school programs work to adapt to the constantly changing situation. McKenna advises parents that “no one really knows what the virus is going to do. We at Buds and Blossoms are doing what we can to keep our children safe. You, as a parent, have to be comfortable. We want you to be comfortable before you send your child to school.”

20200904,COVID-19 makes obtaining job training even more challenging,"By Carey Lin
Some students at job training programs in AACA are funded by vouchers through the MassHire Career Center. (Photo courtesy of AACA)
Earlier this year, unemployment rates skyrocketed to 14.7% in April, the highest ever recorded since 1948, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. However, MassHire Career Centers and services have been limited due to mandatory social distancing measures. While not open to the public, MassHire can still be reached over the phone or online. Nonprofits such as the Asian American Civic Association (AACA) also have services available in career advising, job training, and placement.
While many services at MassHire are free, entering a job training program can come at a cost and come with certain obstacles that seem to be more difficult due to the pandemic. 
“There’s more to it to get the programs funded. […] When these funds are allocated, they don’t have to pay out of pocket, and it’s not on them, they don’t have to pay it back. However, there are a number of qualifications and eligibility requirements for them to be enrolled and be accepted,” said George Lumpkins, a Program Manager at AACA. Lumpkins has been working with workforce since 1999.  “This money is available through every single Career Center in the state. Some people have paid for the training program out of their own pocket without knowing that this can be funded by the state.”
Since 1998, most of the funding for job training programs comes from the Workforce Innovation and Opportunities Act (WIOA), a federal grant passed with the aim of helping people get back on their feet. Lumpkins credits WIOA with “finding training that would improve their life, and moving forward with career opportunities.”

According to the President and CEO of the MassHire Metro-North Workforce Board Chris Albrizio-Lee, the WIOA fund is allocated based on region. “There’s a lot of different funds, mostly from the federal and state. Those are largely given to the system on a formula basis. There is a formula that determines what each region or state gets,” said Albrizio-Lee.
Lumpkins said, “It goes on basically how well your state is doing. When the economy is good, and everyone is working, you’re going to get less. It happens by Fiscal Year – July is the starting point and it goes through June of the following year.”
According to Albrizio-Lee, Metro-North received a budget cut of 10% this year. “It’s a little bit weird because right now there’s historic unemployment, but the current fiscal year’s WIOA allocations were based on data before the COVID-19 pandemic. Before the pandemic, the economy was actually really good and unemployment was actually really low,” he said. “While we are still hoping for additional supplemental funding, we are not optimistic just because of the climate right now.”
To compensate, Albrizio-Lee stated that the Board plans to be more aggressive in securing funding through non-governmental sources to make up for the shortfall. 
There are other sources of funding available, such as the Jobs Creation and Retention Trust, which is specific to the City of Somerville. However, applying for funding depends on where the applicant resides. Lumpkins said, “It’s situational, and the grants are allocated based on neighborhood.”
The limited number of funds allocated means a limited number of people can access those funds. Lumpkins explains, “Say if there’s a Career Center that has 60 spots. And they’re able to fund training centers.”
Even if the individual obtains one of the limited Career Center training spots, the funding may not cover the entire cost of the training. This places the burden of paying for the training on the individual or the training organization. Lumpkins said, “For instance our Banking and Finance program is $6200, and we’re getting funds from Metro-North, but their funding is capped at $6000 per voucher, then AACA will cover the other 200.”
In addition to record high unemployment numbers, the pandemic has made it even more difficult to obtain in-person career services due to social distancing measures. According to Albrizio-Lee, they are in discussion with the different MassHire regions as well as with the State, but there are no plans for a physical reopening at the moment. 
“Career Centers are open, but they’re not seeing the general public. They’re asking folks to either call or contact them online. It’s very hard,” said Lumpkins. “That’s where I would usually do my recruitment directly – from career centers and from Department of Transition Assistance, where we speak in person with clients and tell them about our services.”
This is devastating for those who are struggling and require in-person assistance.
“People are applying now, but you can’t just give a list of what services are offered. It works better in-person, getting to know people and help people figure out what they want to do,” said Lumpkins.
While obtaining help at a Career Center is even more challenging currently, MassHire is still issuing funding, and nonprofits are doing the best they can to still accommodate and find other funding options despite the obstacles. Lumpkins encourages people to still seek out available services. “If you’re interested, let’s sit down, let’s have a conversation, and see if we have a good fit for you,” he said.

20200904,"Tufts, Emerson and residents talk safety concerns of the new Chinatown COVID-19 testing site","By Anqi Zhang
To address residents’ concerns about the COVID-19 testing site on 116 Harrison Avenue, located inside Chinatown, the Office of Ed Flynn organized a Zoom meeting on Aug. 18 for different parties in the community. The site is welcoming students from two universities in the neighborhood. Attendees of the discussion included Chinatown residents and representatives from Tufts Medical Center, Tufts University School of Medicine, and Emerson College.
“I believe that we should have a robust conversation about neighbors’ concerns about reopening testing and how we can address them as a community,” said Flynn, speaking to the necessity of community input involvement during the whole process.
Chinatown residents are worried about the possibility of super spreading, with students returning to the campuses and taking COVID-19 tests in Chinatown.
“Enforcement needs to be discussed,” he said, including “how we can effectively ensure that students are wearing masks, observing physical distancing, and not congregating in large groups or parties.”
The testing site opened in August and is located at the former site of the Tufts University bookstore. It was built by Tufts University in partnership with its Medical Center and accepts students from Tufts University Graduate School and Emerson College to take COVID-19 testing.
Tom Malone, Executive Associate Dean at Tufts University School of Medicine, said that there is a little confusion between the testing site for students and the walk-up facility that the Tufts Medical Center is currently running. The walk-up facility located at 171 Harrison Ave is open to the public. No pre-registration for this location is required.
“The facility at 116 Harrison Avenue was designed to not have lines of people outside,” Malone said. No more than 50 people would be scheduled per half hour, and the inside testing space can currently hold at least 50 people, he explained.
Rocco DiRico, Director of Government and Community Relations at Tufts University, said in the meeting, “a key part of our plan is to reduce density on campus as much as possible.”
Among the 2700 students enrolled in programs on the health science campus, which is located in the Chinatown area, less than 1300 would be required for on-campus instruction, DiRico said. Most of those students come from dental and medical school, “so generally speaking, they’re very conscious of the importance of health care, masks, and social distancing,” he said.
To further guarantee that the community spread does not occur due to students coming and going at the campus, Tufts University set up a mandatory surveillance testing program, which all students are required to participate in at least once a week.
Responding to residents’ question about why Emerson College set its testing site at Tufts Medical Center rather than its own campus, Peggy Ings, the Vice President of Government and Community Relations at Emerson College, said they do not have the medical resources and expertise needed on campus.
“It’s also the intention of the college to keep the Chinatown community safe. We will have monitors at the site,” said Ings. “The college’s goal is to try to do the testing, repeat the testing, and repeat it again, so that we catch anything and everything at the time when the students first arrive.”
Another opinion from residents expressed at the meeting was about the lack of communication on the testing site and that the community involvement was missed during the process.
“I know there were mistakes made. One of the mistakes was not really engaging the residents, but that’s in the past,” said Flynn. He said that in the following days, “in terms of notifying the residents, please notify me first. I’m the elected official, and I will coordinate outreach to the Chinatown community.” Additionally, residents must not forget to communicate with relative neighborhood organizations, which “do a tremendous, outstanding job,” he said.
Lydia Lowe, Executive Director at Chinatown Community Land Trust, said that the surrounding communities are as concerned as the campus community and that they have hoped that a mechanism will form to keep the communication regularly circulating. 
“I hope this is something we can continue, whether it’s once a week or every two weeks or so,” said Flynn. “Let’s continue working together. That’s the critical part of this process.”

20200904,"Bella Long, The Original Queen of Chinatown","By Richard Auffrey
Picture of Bella, smoking opium while reclining on her couch. From the Boston Sunday Post, October 27, 1895.
Who was the original “Queen of Chinatown”? The answer will likely surprise you, until you consider the circumstances of the time. 
For approximately twenty years, until her death in 1906, Bella Long was the undisputed Queen of Chinatown. She was likely the first white woman, married to a Chinese man, who lived in Boston’s Chinatown, having arrived in town around 1880-1882. Her past before she moved to Chinatown was mired in mystery and throughout most of her life she was addicted to opium. 
During the late 19th century, few Chinese women traveled to the U.S., partially because their men traveled there, planning to only be there temporarily and return home with money. In addition, racist laws served to make it very difficult for Chinese women to come to the U.S. In 1880, the ratio of Chinese men to women was about 21:1, rising to 27:1 in 1890. 
Consider that in 1892, there were about 1000 Chinese men living in Boston, but in 1893, there were only about three Chinese women in Chinatown. Ten years later, there were only about fourteen Chinese women. With such a great disparity, it was inevitable that some Chinese men chose to marry white women, like Bella Long. 
Prior to her arrival in Boston, the Boston Sunday Post, March 31, 1901, claimed that she had been a bareback rider in the circus, graduated from medical college in New York, and provided medical care for the Chinese. None of this appears to be true. 
More credible background seemed to be offered by the Boston Herald, December 23, 1905, which reported that Bella married a white sailor while in New York, but he was lost at sea. Then, Bella married Yuen Song, who was a jealous man and eventually tried to kill her. He was convicted and sentenced to 10 years in prison, though Bella pled for leniency so he only served 18 months. 
In the early 1880s, when Yuen was released from prison, they moved to Boston and lived at 29 Harrison Avenue, a residence that Bella would remain in throughout the rest of her life. As of June 1889, she was the only white woman living in Chinatown. 
The Boston Daily Globe, May 13, 1895, noted the police raided Bella’s residence, believing it to be an opium joint. The police found plenty of opium, pipes and other paraphernalia, as well as four Chinese men who had been partaking. Yuen and Bella were arrested, though it appears they only had to pay a small fine to resolve the matter.
Five months later, the Boston Sunday Post, October 27, 1895, noted that Bella was the “undisputed Queen of Chinatown.” This was the first newspaper to refer to Bella as the Queen of Chinatown, and that designation became common after this point.
Around March 1901, after the death of her husband, Bella married another Chinese man, Jim Gong, who was dying of consumption. By 1902, a number of other white women had also married Chinese men and lived in Chinatown, but none dared anger or oppose Bella, the Queen of Chinatown.
Around July 1905, Bella’s husband died of tuberculosis. About a month later, there was speculation that Bella might marry again, this time to “Jim the Guide,” who gave guided tours of Chinatown. However, by December, Bella was diagnosed with tuberculosis and spent a little time in a hospital. 
The Boston Herald, December 23, 1905, wrote: “She has been the Chinamen’s acute adviser. She was true blue. She could be trusted. To her they turned when danger threatened and they found themselves at a disadvantage because of their inability to speak English fluently.” The article also mentioned how during most of her time in Chinatown, she mainly remained in her apartment, which was described as “dark, dirty, ill-ventilated and choky with the fumes of opium.” Bella claimed to have been smoking opium for about 26 years, having started when she was 17-years old when she visited an opium den in New York City.
Five months later, the Boston Globe, May 15, 1906,reported that Bella had died of consumption. When she had arrived in Chinatown, she was young and pretty, and quickly a big hit. She used to give audiences in her home, often reclining on her couch, smoking opium, though ironically also warning people about the dangers of opium. After Bella’s death, her apartment became a tourist attraction, which cost people 50 cents to visit.
Would there be a successor to the title of Queen of Chinatown? Soon after Bella’s death, the two local tongs, the On Leong and the Hip Sing, each put forth their own candidate for the title, but apparently neither was successful. It wouldn’t be until the 1920s that a new Queen would arise, Irene Wong, and she was also a white woman married to a Chinese man. But that is a story for another time.

20200821,Taiwan appoints new Director-General Jonathan Sun to Boston office,"Jonathan Sun is the new Director-General of TECO-Boston. (Photo Courtesy of TECO)
Jonathan Sun is the new Director-General of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office (TECO) in Boston. He arrived in Boston on July 28 after spending the past four years in Taiwan. Prior to that, Sun had spent six years in New York and another six in Washington D.C. As the new Director-General of TECO Boston, Sun hopes to continue the work of his predecessors to strengthen the ties between Taiwan and New England.
“I believe my predecessors have done whatever they can to expand the relationship between Taiwan and New England,” Sun told Sampan in an interview at his office. “What I can do is to help build upon the solid foundation they have built and continue to strengthen the friendship.”
Sun began his career in 1998 working for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Taiwan. During his first three years, he worked in the Department of North American Affairs. Then, he was sent to New York for six years where he served as the assistant to the Director-General of TECO in New York. During his time there he worked on the campaign for Taiwan’s participation in the United Nations in New York. Returning to Taiwan, he worked in the Department of International Organizations as the UN Section Chief, focusing on international participation and outreach.
After three-and-a-half years, he was sent to Washington D.C. He worked in the Political Division for a total of six years. “I worked with a lot of think tanks and federal government officials and talked about different issues,” Sun said. “We have many people working in critical divisions covering different aspects of the issues. I was covering the international participation as well as the defense and security issues.”
Returning to Taipei again after his time in D.C., Sun worked in three different departments where he spent a total of four years until he left for Boston.
“The United States is Taiwan’s most important foreign relation,” Sun said. “We also have good relations with many other countries and more than 100 missions and offices abroad.”
Sun explained that the important thing is finding “likeminded partners,” a term from the West that has been emphasized in recent speeches and interviews by President of Taiwan, Tsai Ing-Wen herself.
“As a democratic country, Taiwan faces aggressive pressures from the neighboring authoritarian regime of China,” said Sun. “Through like-minded democracy conferences, we hope to create more support for Taiwan. I think the most important thing is we need more friends and allies to face the pressures from China. We need to find ways to garner more support, not only moral, but more concrete support to assist Taiwan.
For this reason, he said, TECO’s goal is to find ways to let more people learn about and appreciate Taiwan.
“Though small, Taiwan is a force to be reckoned with,” said Sun. “Taiwan is a force of good. We greatly appreciate all the longtime support for our embassy and our government. We’re here. The door is open. We welcome anyone who wishes to understand Taiwan, or has any comments or concerns to contact us. We wish to hear your voices. If we can answer you, we will. If we cannot, we are willing to discuss it with Taipei. We wish to develop good relations and hope that all those who support Taiwan continue to do so in the future.”

20200821,Reggie Wong Park brings local sports teams together during August Moon Tournament,"September 2019, before the Covid pandemic shut the world down, was the 75th annual North American Chinese Invitational Volleyball Tournament, involving 162 teams from across the continent who gathered to compete in the traditional Chinese American sport of 9-man volleyball. Last year’s tournament was held in Toronto, but in 2024, the tournament will come home to Boston’s Chinatown.
9-man Volleyball History
9-man volleyball is a team sport utilizing nine players per side and a slightly larger (10 x 20 meter) court that originated in Taishan, China, the homeland of the majority of Chinese working class immigrants who settled Boston and other Chinatowns in North America.
While originating in Taishan, 9-man evolved with a set of rules unique to Chinese Americans, rooted in Chinatown’s history as a bachelor society of male laborers due to the Chinese Exclusion Act.  Separated from their families and isolated by discrimination and racial violence, restaurant workers and laundrymen found community together with nine-man volleyball as their only healthy social outlet. The rules of 9-man were consciously designed to preserve Chinese cultural traditions, including a rule that 66 percent of team players must be Chinese.
9-man is a gritty game played in the alleys and parking lots of Chinatown, and the home of 9-man volleyball is Reggie Wong Park at the corner of Kneeland and Lincoln Streets. Teams from Boston and Providence organized the first inter-city nine-man tournament in 1938. Since then, it has grown into a popular tournament that travels between cities and brings together thousands of players and spectators every Labor Day weekend.

Reggie Wong Park, a gathering place for local sports teams
Every August, the August Moon Tournament at Reggie Wong Park brings together local teams such as the Boston Chinese Freemasons, the Boston Hurricanes, Women’s Volleyball Freemasons, and the Boston Knights Athletic Club, founded by the late Reggie Wong in 1961. Volleyball and basketball teams practice regularly during the warm weather months.
Reggie Wong, born and raised in Chinatown, was a small business consultant, proprietor of Weggie’s Pub in the Leather District, and a community leader who was known and loved not only in Boston, but in Chinatowns throughout the continent, for his work to grow the international nine-man volleyball tournament. Reggie was key to the advocacy and negotiations that led to the creation of Pagoda Park in the 1970s.
Chinatown, at the time, had the least amount of open space per capita of any neighborhood in the city. Even now, spaces tend to be passive parks and paved plazas with sparse greenery; Chinatown has 6.2 trees per acre, compared to 10.2 trees in Bay Village or 11.1 in the South End.
“When we were kids, there was an open field there, before the Wang building was built,” said Russell Eng, Reggie’s nephew and now president of Friends of Reggie Wong Park. “We would play football, baseball, and other sports. Then the park was built in the 70s, and Reggie wanted to name it Pagoda Park, to make a note of how the area was part of Chinatown.”
After Reggie Wong passed away, Chinatown and the Leather District came together to rename the park in his memory.
“I can’t think of a better way to honor him than to name this park for him,” said Chris Betke of the Leather District Neighborhood Association at the dedication in 2012, involving then-mayor Thomas Menino, state representative Aaron Michlewitz, and others. “It took on a life of its own. We put up an online petition, and, within a day or two, we had a thousand signatures.”
Following in his uncle’s footsteps, Russell and the Knights Athletic Club have been bringing teenagers to the park to teach them about nine-man volleyball, the history of the park, and the importance of Chinatown as both a neighborhood and cultural center. Chinatown restaurant workers, some living in the neighborhood and others commuting in from outlying communities, have their own teams of nine-man players.
Securing the park’s future
Reggie Wong Park was born out of the residents’ advocacy and creative search for active recreational space. Wang Electronics came and went, the Central Artery went underground, but, by hook or by crook, the park has remained for nearly fifty years. Today, the park is entering a new phase of community governance and stewardship by both local neighbors and volleyball teams committed to protecting this shared resource.
Owned by the state Department of Transportation, the park spent a number of years under City of Boston jurisdiction, but that relationship was terminated in 2009. After the renaming as Reggie Wong Park, an ad-hoc license agreement to the North American Chinese Volleyball Association allowed for its year-to-year use as a recreational area. When the Department of Transportation began soliciting bids for the land in 2016, the community worried about the future of Reggie Wong Park.
From 2016 to 2018, Tufts University researchers and Olin College of Engineering students worked with the community on studies to monitor the air quality around the park and to consider the potential for designs to improve the health, safety, and usability of the park.
In 2018, the Chinatown Community Land Trust began convening local residents and other park users to talk about ways to protect the park and spearheaded an effort to raise funds for park improvements. The City of Boston’s Community Preservation program pledged a grant of $100,000, and Leather District-based developer Hudson Group pledged a $25,000 contribution. The committee met with Transportation Secretary Stephanie Pollack and other DOT representatives over the past year and successfully negotiated for a 15-year renewable lease to implement improvements and govern park programming.
Reopening, improving, and collectively governing the park
The Chinatown Community Land Trust worked with Russell Eng and a committee of Chinatown residents, Leather District neighbors, and nine-man volleyball enthusiasts to found Friends of Reggie Wong Park (FRWP). FRWP is dedicated to the preservation, improvement, and stewardship of the park. Chinatown CLT’s involvement grew from its focus on community ownership and control of the land, and its commitment to building local structures for democratic governance of shared resources for the common good.
Chinatown CLT will continue to partner with FRWP to implement improvements to the park. While FRWP will be the leaseholder and govern park programming, Chinatown CLT will be represented on the board and retain the right to override a decision to relocate or make substantial changes to the park.
With the park shut down for several months during the pandemic, Massachusetts DOT is preparing for the reopening of Reggie Wong Park in the coming weeks. As FRWP prepares to take over the park, the committee also will share proposals for park improvements and involve the community in planning for the future.
Reggie Wong Park is a precious resource in the heart of the city, for Chinatown as a historic immigrant working class neighborhood and regional hub for the New England Chinese community, for the neighbors in the Leather District loft apartments and new Chinatown high rise buildings, and for the 9-man volleyball teams and others who have been core users of the park. With the reopening of Reggie Wong Park, there is an opportunity to preserve it as a historic and cultural anchor for Chinatown and 9-man volleyball, while improving the park as a welcoming space for a diverse spectrum of residents of all ages.

20200821,"Mary Yick, a pioneering restaurateur of Chinatown who fought discrimination","From restaurant owner to blackjack dealer, Mary Yick, like two other Chinatown restaurateurs, Ruby Foo and Anita Chue, was another pioneering woman in the Chinatown’s restaurant industry, owning the Tiki Hut restaurant on Tyler Street.
Mary Yick was born around 1934 and made her first appearance in a local newspaper, the Boston Herald, in November 1939. At age 5, she and two other young Chinese girls were photographed walking in a parade in Chinatown, part of the first rice bowl party for war relief work in China.
In October 1943, Mary, and three other Chinese children, were photographed as they distributed pedestrian safety booklets on the Traffic Day of Boston’s Smash the 7th Column Campaign, which was intended to reduce accidental death and injury.
When Mary was around 17 years old, in October 1951, she was once again shown in a photograph in a local newspaper, the Boston Traveler. Mary and eight other young Chinese women were pictured in their costumes as hostesses during the dedication ceremonies for the new headquarters and community building of the Chinese Merchants Association.
An advertisement for the Tiki Hut in the Boston Traveler, Sept. 13, 1963.
In her first known food connection, in the Boston Globe in April 1956, Mary was mentioned in an article discussing Otto Mammon who owned the Polynesian Village at Hotel Somerset. Otto stated, “Our Polynesian and Cantonese food suits the Boston palate.” In addition, the article published two recipes from the restaurant, including Lobster Pina and Flaming Polynesian Steak. In the accompanying photograph, Otto was shown teaching Mary Yick how to handle a lobster.
In July 1961, Lanai, Inc. was established and managed by Jean A. DiNapoli; it took over the location at 10 Tyler Street and established a restaurant. A year later, in November 1961, Mary Yick had become the manager of Lanai, Inc. and sought a liquor license for the new Tiki Hut at 10 Tyler Street.
One of the first major newspaper references to the Tiki Hut wasn’t until the Boston Traveler, Sept. 13, 1963, noting that the Tiki Hut was a cocktail lounge, specializing in creative Cantonese cuisine. It was also mentioned that Hostess Mary Yick was “one of Boston’s nicest people.” Another article, in the Boston Herald, March 2, 1965, recommended that you order a Tiki Tornado at the Tiki Hut.
An article in the Boston Globe, Feb. 13, 1970, noted how “The Tiki Hut is a favorite after-show stop for many theatrical people when they’re in town.” Many celebrities dined there and some of those regulars included David Merrick, Angela Lansbury, and Shakespearean actor Nicol Williamson. On the theatrical circuit, Mary Yick was affectionately known as “The Dragon Lady.”

Unfortunately, Mary and the Tiki Hut ran into a serious problem in mid-1971. The Boston Globe, June 2, 1971, noted that “Mary is the only remaining on-site female entrepreneur of a restaurant-lounge in Chinatown.” Mary was facing a possible ouster from her 10 Tyler Street location. The owner of the premises, the Lee On Dong Association, attempted to conduct an “auction in the Chinese tradition of her lease.” Fortunately, Mary was able to secure an injunction to halt the auction until the owners could come forward and justify themselves to the court.
In her petition, Mary stated there had been an “alleged violation of her civil rights on the basis of discrimination because of her sex.” She was “Alleging a concerted course of action against women business functionaries in the restaurant field.”  Her petition also claimed that Anita Chue had been previously removed from her own restaurant by persons common to the group attempting to oust her. Finally, the petition noted that, “Traditionally, Chinese mores dictate that Chinese females are inferior to Chinese males, and that Chinese females should not be entrepreneurs or occupy any position other than that which calls for menial or household work.”
Mary and the Tiki Hut lasted only another year, though at least it seemed the lease ouster had been prevented, when in November 1972, she transferred the liquor license to Mai Lai Inc., managed by Kwok Man Yu, who would operate a restaurant at the same address.
The Boston Globe, Dec. 1, 1972, noted this loss in and referred to Mary Yick “of the lyrical voice and quick quips that (gently but plainly) put down amorous customers.” The article also stated, “Her departure ends, at least for the time, a tradition begun by the legendary Ruby Foo and later Anita Chue.” After taking several trips to various parts of the world, Mary moved to Las Vegas and became a blackjack dealer at Caesar’s Palace.
Once again, we have a Chinese woman who left a strong legacy in Chinatown. Like Ruby Foo and Anita Chue, Mary Yick was an intelligent, charming, and savvy business woman who became a success in the restaurant industry and introduced many people to the wonders of Chinese cuisine, especially Cantonese. Her restaurant career ended too shortly, potentially due to discrimination because she was a woman. A tragedy in its own right.

20200821,"50 years later, a movement is afoot to restore the Chinatown Sampan mural as organizers reach out for support","What lies forgotten or not known by many is the mural of a Sampan boat that was painted in 1970 in Chinatown for the celebration of the first August Moon Festival. The mural was covered up 10 years ago during the renovation of the adjacent public park, named after community activist Mary SooHoo. This vinyl wrap was taken from a tiny 14th Century Chinese traditional landscape painting on display at the Museum of Fine Arts. From what I can tell, the only connection to the community is that the scene is Chinese in origin.
When the park underwent renovation 10 years ago, a decision was made to cover up the mural instead of restoring it. Probably after 40 years, the mural had faded and needed to be restored.  MassDOT, which owns the Vent Building is, planning on doing extensive repair work in the next couple of years. We in the community need to advocate to restore the mural so it does not get washed out or covered up again.
Last month, a mural “Roxbury Love” was demolished to make way for an affordable housing complex. Although the plans had been in the works for a while and the old industrial building where the mural was painted had been vacant, residents were sad to see it gone.
Murals can have special meaning for communities to where it exists. It can represent a particular period of time that symbolized a part of the neighborhood’s history and pride.
The Sampan mural in Chinatown has remained covered for 10 years. There is an effort underway to restore it. (Ken Smith/Sampan)
Over the years, community members have expressed disappointment that the Sampan mural was covered up and not restored. This mural represented Chinatown’s history and accomplishments.  The 1970’s was a waking period in Chinatown.  It was painted by a local artist, Daniel Heung, and with the help of neighborhood youths from the Chinese Americans for Tomorrow.  Those involved included Stephanie Fan, Cynthia Yee, Peter Chan, Jeffrey Wong, Karin Wong Ching, James Bing Fong, Jenny Ng, Jimmy Ng. Wilson Wong and Dana Wong.
The late Tunney Lee conveyed that Daniel Heung told him the meaning behind the Sampan mural was, “Sailing towards Adversities”.  This truly depicts the historical experience of Chinese immigrants that is filled with hardship and discrimination.
Although it was commonly known that coming to America would mean hard labor, the Chinese were willing to make the sacrifice so that their families would have better opportunities. America used to be referred to as” Gum San” (Golden Mountain). Early Chinese came to the U.S. to dig for gold in California, and later were commissioned to build the railroads through the Sierra Nevada Mountains and the Northwest. In 1870, 75 Chinese laborers were brought to North Adams, Mass., to work as strike breakers at the Sampson Shoe Factory. It is believed that after their 3- year contract had finished; some made their way to Boston.  In 1882, Congress passed the Chinese Exclusion Act, practically terminating most Chinese immigration for the next 80 years.  Those stuck here resorted to menial work that no one else would do.
Sampan literally means “3 boards” in Cantonese. Describing a construction with one board in the middle and two boards on each side. In China, such boats were typically used for fishing or transportation. In the mid 1900’s, Hong Kong Harbor was filled with Sampan boats where families resided. Most Chinese immigrants came from Canton, and after the China revolution, the majority of immigrants came via Hong Kong since most contact was cut off from the mainland.
Inspired by the Civil Rights movement of the ‘60’s, a new generation of American-born and college-educated Chinatown activists emerged and saw the many inequities in their own community, and still reeling from the neighborhood land takings as a result of the construction of the Southeast Expressway and the Mass Turnpike. Occurring a decade prior, when Chinatown had no clout to stop the bulldozing, almost 50 percent of Chinatown’s footprint was lost, but young activists sought social justice. Displaced were hundreds of families and businesses, with blocks of Chinese occupied tenement row house, buildings, and churches destroyed. The activists organized, demanding that Chinatown’s needs be equitably addressed
It was also a pivotal time in Chinatown, when a group of young leaders emerged and complained about the lack of available services to Chinatown residents. This new brand of activists led by Frank Chin formed the “Grievance Task Force” where forums were organized and government officials were invited to hear the underserved needs of the Chinatown community, which included: affordable housing, health care, elderly care, English as a Second Language (ESL), translation services, and economic opportunities. According to Peter Chan one of the Task Force members, the activists clashed with the mindset of the traditional leaders (old guard) who felt that Chinatown could take care of their own and didn’t like airing its problems to outsiders.
As a result of this, 1970’s activism and agencies were formed to address the issues that were laid out by the Grievance Task Force. These organizations included: The Golden Age Center, South Cove Health Center, Chinese American Civic Association (now AACA), Asian Community Development Corporation, the Chinese Economic Development Corp, the South Cove Manor Nursing Home. Developments such as Tai Tung Village and Mass Pike Towers brought low income housing which the community desperately needed.
The aftermath of the Civil Rights Movement caused rioting in many urban cities across the country. “Summerthing”, initiated in 1968, was the brainchild of newly elected Mayor Kevin White. His vision was to channel the energy of young people, providing positive outlets through the arts, as part of invoking neighborhood pride and community celebration. It was an effective means to ease racial tension and social strife.
Kathy Kane was Mayor White’s Director of the Arts and Culture Department. It started out using public art, such as murals that would have special meaning for each neighborhood. The goal was to have a mural in each community that would dress up dreary brick or concrete walls and promote positive feelings. Peter Chan said that the Sampan was a symbol of Chinese culture, where immigrants crossed the ocean to come to this new country. Amy Guen, who was the interpreter for the Grievance Task Force, said that the sun and moon on the mural represented hope and good fortune. Something the Chinese always wished for.
This year marks the 50th anniversary of the Sampan Mural. Because of the pandemic, there will be no August Moon Festival. The Sampan Mural represents a special time in Chinatown, it is a nod to our Chinese American heritage, and it is the birth of Chinatown activism that directly spawned the many successful not-for profit service agencies which have improved the quality of life in our community. To obtain funding to restore the Sampan mural, the Boston Landmarks Commission will need to deem it historically significant to Chinatown. Once this is done, the project can be eligible for funding from the Community Preservation Act, which is managed by the City of Boston and other foundations.

20200821,Chinatown Master Plan 2020 covers a broad spectrum of future development and community needs,"The Chinatown Master Plan Committee released Master Plan 2020 with two recent launch events, involving more than a hundred participants from the community, local officials, and other interested stakeholders.
Chinatown Master Plan 2020 is a 91-page report, with English and Chinese language versions, that includes data snapshots, updated community development priorities, and identification of four “opportunity areas” where development could support community health and stability.
Drafted out of a year-and-a-half planning process involving residents, small business owners, community organizations, and planners, the plan calls for a thousand more units of affordable housing, zero pedestrian fatalities, 27 percent green canopy coverage, and creation of a Chinatown historic and cultural district.
The plan was published by the Chinatown Master Plan Committee with support from the Chinatown Community Land Trust and the Metropolitan Area Planning Council. The Community Assessment of Freeway Exposure and Health (CAFEH) project provided funding support for a Health Lens Analysis, which led to a broader planning process and report.
Emerging from the coronavirus pandemic requires a stronger commitment to racial and economic equity, said organizers, with a particular effort to help the community’s small businesses and service sector workforce survive. Many of Chinatown’s businesses suffered a major Covid-19 related slowdown as early as January, when the virus was on the upswing in China.
“It is important that we help the community small businesses survive to keep Chinatown as a neighborhood for immigrant, working class families,” said District 2 Boston City Councilor Ed Flynn.
Noting that the Asian population is a decreasing percentage of the community, the plan calls for both affordable housing production and preservation with a priority on low-income families. The post-coronavirus recession poses new challenges, and organizers emphasized that they do not want a repeat of the 2008 recession.
Housing chief Sheila Dillon pledged to continue working in partnership with the community to ensure Chinatown’s future and thanked leaders for their untiring advocacy.
Chinatown has a history of neighborhood planning, dating back to the first Chinatown Community Plan of 1990, which was published by the Boston Redevelopment Authority in partnership with community leaders.
The Chinatown Master Plan Committee decided to publish Master Plan 2020 in order to run parallel to and supplement the City of Boston’s PLAN: Downtown process with greater detail about Chinatown’s needs and priorities. For instance, the plan calls for a Row House Protection Area and other zoning reforms to protect Chinatown against speculation-driven displacement. PLAN: Downtown will culminate in zoning amendments for the entire downtown area, including Chinatown.
The committee hopes that the City of Boston will acknowledge Chinatown Master Plan 2020 as the general plan for Chinatown, in the same way that the Chinatown Community Plan of 1990 was recognized as the neighborhood plan in the Boston zoning code. The plan focuses on four topics explored by PLAN: Downtown and recommends strategies for Chinatown.  Community residents and organizations will be holding followup discussions on each of these topics with relevant City departments.

20200821,‘Lantern Stories’ public art will soon illuminate Chinatown’s Chin Park,"Lanterns represent light and symbolize a brighter future. It is the significance and meaning behind the tradition of hanging lanterns in Chinese culture that inspired artist Yu-Wen Wu to propose a public art piece, responding to The Rose Kennedy Greenway’s call for project ideas. When Wu’s concept was chosen, she began designing a work called “Lantern Stories” that would be installed in Chinatown’s Chin Park.
“The concept proposed by the Greenway was for a light based artwork at Chin Park working with the community,” said Wu, who was born in Taipei, Taiwan and now lives and works in Boston. “Over many months, when I spoke with community organizers, residents, businesses, or even passers-by, as I sketched ideas in the park, I thought it was really important to honor the tradition of lanterns but in a contemporary way. This artwork is designed for the daytime, as well as the nighttime. I hope at first, one experiences beauty and hope in these difficult times.  And as you draw closer and look more deeply, appreciate the history of the people and culture that make this community extraordinary and resilient.”

On July 21, the Greenway Conservancy held a webinar on “Lantern Stories”, discussing the project and highlighting the importance of public art. The talk was moderated by Greenway Conservancy public art project manager Sheila Novak and featured speakers Wu, Jeena Hah, of the Asian Community Development Corporation, and Courtney Ho, City of Boston engagement specialist.  The discussion followed Wu’s creative process and explored the importance of preserving Asian culture in a gentrifying Chinatown.
Wu said that it was very clear to her that the work should represent the Chinatown community and reflect the experiences of the local people. She randomly approached individuals to engage in conversation in the park and at neighborhood businesses, reaching out to residents who she knew of as well. In February, the Greenway Conservancy hosted a more formalized listening session at the Pao Arts Center to gather community input through a public call.  Wu posed questions to the attendees, who wrote responses on post-it notes.
“I asked questions such as, ‘What does light mean to you?’ ‘In what ways does Chinatown interest you?’ ‘What does Chinatown mean to you?’ ‘What are your hopes for Boston’s Chinatown?’” said Wu. “A participant wrote, ‘Chinatown is such a wonderful neighborhood, in its community and culture.  A lot of the community stems from the collective stories of immigration.  It has built a sense of belonging that has lasted through history until now.”
Based on the stories and histories that Wu collected, she began to conceptualize a work of art.  She designed over 30 lanterns with a variety of shapes and forms to illuminate the culture and resiliency of the Chinatown community, creating most of her designs in her own studio. The images on the lanterns convey the accounts and messages she found, telling tales of endurance, particularly in the face of anti-Asian sentiment and racial inequities. Wu worked with Jaywalk Studio, which has been participating in the actual fabrication of the lanterns. While imagining the models, the creators had to consider how the lanterns would withhold weather conditions, such as wind and rain, and have thought of using compressed wood for the frames.  Wu said that the collaboration has been very fruitful.
Panelists spoke about what they would like people to experience when they see the lanterns, which will be installed around early September. Wu said that she hopes spectators will acknowledge their beauty, while Ho said that she hopes more people will want to visit Chinatown. Viewers may also see a reflection of themselves through the artwork, said Hah.
“I think my personal hope is that they’ll just really see themselves in the art,” said Hah. “Feeling safe in a public space is what will lend itself to more healing and joy, coming out of this season.”

20200807,"Councilor Flynn walks the streets of Chinatown while addressing ongoing issues: Street trash, crime and public safety","Captain Robert Ciccolo (left) and officer Steven Chen, both newly assigned to the Chinatown area, joined City Councilor Ed Flynn for a neighborhood walk-through to address public concerns regarding safety, street trash, and other issues. (Anqi Zhang/Sampan)
In front of a landmark tourist attraction, Boston City Councilor Ed Flynn began a walk-through at the Chinatown Gate Friday, July 31. Flynn represents District 2, which includes Chinatown. The councilman conducted a walk-through in the neighborhood, while listening to and answering questions from residents and local advocates. Along with him were police officers in charge of the area, and other representatives from the business community, and local civic organizations.
The gathering was in response to residents’ recent complaints about public safety, public health, and sanitation in Chinatown. Flynn invited Captain Robert Ciccolo, who was assigned to the district this July, intending to let residents and the new captain learn more about each other and discuss neighborhood concerns together.
“We want to make sure that Chinatown, the leather district, and the surrounding downtown neighborhood are safe for everybody, but especially safe for our seniors, for persons with disabilities, for parents that are taking the kids to school,” Flynn said as he addressed the groups. “This is about the neighborhood. This is about the families.”
Flynn gave special thanks to police officers that were assigned to the area and expressed his appreciation of the work they had done for the neighborhood. “What the residents expressed to me is that they want to continue seeing police presence in the neighborhood. And I know that’s what the captain is committed to doing,” he said.
A question and answer session was conducted prior to the walk-through with attendees in front of the Chinatown Gate. Residents asked questions directly to the councilor and police officers as Melissa Lo, the councilor’s assistant, worked as a Cantonese and English translator.
Members of the audience expressed their dissatisfaction with the lack of police presence and delayed 911 response in the neighborhood. With the long-standing drug dealing and mugging issues in and around areas, one audience member recommended having a consistent patrolman walking on the streets.

Ciccolo explained the reason for their delayed response. With limited resources on hands, they need to prioritize how they respond, he said. “Our primary goal is always public safety. It’s not just making people safe, but making people feel safe,” Ciccolo said. “So, first comes dangerous to life, and potentially dangerous to life, and then we move on to responding to public disorder issues and quality of life issues. It never means we don’t think the quality of life issues are important. We always do.”
One resident asked whether more police stations could be added. Ciccolo said that’s a budget issue beyond his scope of authority. “A police station is empty most of the time because the officers are out in the neighborhoods, answering calls,” Ciccolo explained. “I’d love to have more police stations, but I’d rather have those cops out in cars coming to help you rather than sitting in a building.”
Ciccolo stressed the difference between the 911 and the 311 issue. When you want to reflect a long-term issue where you don’t need the police right now, that is the 311 issue. “I read the 311 for my district every morning. I’m reading it personally,” he said.
Mike Stratton, Deputy Superintendent from Boston Police Department, addressed the collaboration between local organizations to service residents, including Boston Inspectional Services, the Mayor’s Office of Recovery Services, Pine Street Inn, St. Francis House, Boston Public Health Commission, whose representatives were present at the walk-through.
“We’re all working together daily to address these issues, a lot of the issues that are affecting the community down here,” Stratton said. “When they come to 311, they go right to my unit and all of our partners, so we can figure out very quickly who’s going to address the concern.”
“I would ask when you put something into 311 over the computer, if you will also copy me on the email, and I could also follow up with the mayor’s office,” Flynn added.
Another problem brought up by attendees is trash on the streets and illegal dumping of trash, a problem that has gotten worse during the pandemic, damaging the environment and image of Chinatown.
“I will talk to Inspectional Services. I’m sure the councilor will as well,” said Ciccolo. “We’ll see if we can put something together to deal with it together. It’s more of a civil fine issue than it is a criminal arrest issue.”
“I’m going to file a city council resolution, call for an investigation into illegal dumping in Chinatown,” Flynn told Sampan after the walk-through. “And I’m going to advocate for harsher and stricter penalties for anyone caught illegally dumping.”

In front of a landmark tourist attraction, Boston City Councilor Ed Flynn began a walk-through at the Chinatown Gate Friday, July 31. Flynn represents District 2, which includes Chinatown. The councilman conducted a walk-through in the neighborhood, while listening to and answering questions from residents and local advocates. Along with him were police officers in charge of the area, and other representatives from the business community, and local civic organizations.
The gathering was in response to residents’ recent complaints about public safety, public health, and sanitation in Chinatown. Flynn invited Captain Robert Ciccolo, who was assigned to the district this July, intending to let residents and the new captain learn more about each other and discuss neighborhood concerns together.
“We want to make sure that Chinatown, the leather district, and the surrounding downtown neighborhood are safe for everybody, but especially safe for our seniors, for persons with disabilities, for parents that are taking the kids to school,” Flynn said as he addressed the groups. “This is about the neighborhood. This is about the families.”
Flynn gave special thanks to police officers that were assigned to the area and expressed his appreciation of the work they had done for the neighborhood. “What the residents expressed to me is that they want to continue seeing police presence in the neighborhood. And I know that’s what the captain is committed to doing,” he said.

20200807,"College students voice frustration over pandemic restrictions; for some, it’s a lost fall semester","Some universities in Boston have decided to severely limit the number of students and staff back on campuses and will implement online classes for the upcoming academic year. (Carey Lin/Sampan)
As the pandemic still remains a problem in the United States, universities are unable to reopen college campuses for all their students and staff. Harvard and MIT have chosen to go online for their courses with few exceptions to be on campus. Boston University has chosen to open with a hybrid model of classes, wherein most of the coursework would be online with only some exceptions for in-person coursework. Regulations vary between each university, but all are attempting to limit the number of students on campus to comply with Covid-19 safety regulations.
Returning students have mixed to negative reactions towards the way their universities responded to the issue of continuing coursework during the pandemic.
Harvard University
Earlier in the pandemic, Harvard University was one of the first schools to ask students to leave campus. Elynna Chang, a Chinese-American senior who is currently home in Atlanta, GA., was one of the many students who had to leave on short notice. “I found out I was being kicked off campus mid-March,” she said. “I was actually sleeping in my dorm when my suitemate burst into my room asking if she could come home with me (she’s an international student).” They had five days to pack up everything and go home. “I even remember saying only a few days before the announcement came that there was no way that Harvard would be able to kick all of us off campus,” Chang said.
Without making adjustments to their tuition, Harvard has chosen to do online-only for the 2020-2021 academic year for most students. “Only freshmen class will be collectively allowed back on campus, with some on-campus housing requests granted to upperclassmen who apply,” she said. “For the spring semester, freshmen will be replaced by seniors. All classes will be held online, and students living on campus will have very limited access to campus buildings.”
Chang has decided to take a gap semester and not do her coursework online this fall. She had planned to work on her senior thesis and make use of all valuable resources and networks on campus, which she is now unable to do. In addition, her decision was heavily influenced by the tuition costs for online and virtual classes. “By going completely virtual, Harvard College is now essentially an overpriced version of the Harvard Extension School,” Chang said. “Looking up their tuition and cost of attendance, a full semester at HES for 16 credits (4 courses) would total to less than $20,000 without any financial aid; yet the college is still charging $67,000 for essentially the same thing.”
“I personally think Harvard could have done a much better job in every aspect,” said Chang. For instance, forcing people to move without offering financial support has become a huge problem. Both shipping items home and keeping them in storage would cost hundreds of dollars that not everyone can afford. Moreover, she said that students would have preferred tuition reductions over “enforcing universal pass/fail, which the majority of the student body actually voted against, and allowing more than one class year back on campus in the fall.”
Moreover, Chang said, “The College held several ‘town halls’ but never once allowed audience questions and almost always delivered absolutely no useful information besides constantly promoting the fact that they had set up planning teams and were trying their best. Although they set up a few focus groups with students and sent out surveys to decide what to do for the fall semester, the majority of us did not feel heard and that they weren’t really taking our opinions into account.”
Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)
Like Harvard, MIT has elected to go online for the fall semester. However, seniors are prioritized to return to campus in order to complete their coursework in time to graduate. According to MIT News, they will not be moving forward with the planned tuition increase this year. Undergraduates will also be receiving a grant of $5,000 as well as reduced dining costs by 40 percent.
Kevin Lu is a rising junior at MIT. “MIT’s plans for the upcoming semester are to only have seniors and a select few exempted other students,” he said. “I’m not sure how many seniors elected to stay on campus, but I think 212 students were granted exemptions.”
While he is not sure how classes and research will proceed, Lu is particularly disappointed about the cancelation of a capstone mechanical engineering course where students design and launch a product. “My original plans were to carry on with my degree and also continue training with my Lightweight rowing team, but now I’ll just be taking classes online at home alone,” Lu said. “I decided this because I don’t want to delay my education, and I also don’t think there is something as productive I could do if I were to defer.”
“This whole situation is unfortunate, and I wish the U.S. was better able to contain the virus’s spread like other countries did,” Lu said. “I am not a fan of their response mostly because other schools are opening up.”
Boston University (BU)
Unlike Harvard and MIT, Boston University has chosen to open up campus for returning students and adopt a hybrid model that allows students to take classes remotely or in-person. BU set up a “Back2BU” website that lists extensive details on how BU will proceed with the upcoming semester, including test protocols as well as life on campus.
Sean Cheng, an international student from the Philippines, has been in Boston since the pandemic. According to Cheng, BU has been contacting students regarding their plans for the fall. “I know that we’re given the option to either take in-person classes, online classes, or a mix of both. They’ve been releasing protocols for the upcoming semester and how they’ll be strictly implementing testing locations across campus and social distancing policies to ensure the safety of staff, students, and faculty,” he said. “According to the latest update, we’ve been informed that all students will be required through a digital agreement to comply with wearing face coverings, daily symptoms attestation, routine and frequent testing, contact tracing, quarantine, and isolation.”
While Cheng is disappointed in how his senior year is turning out, he is still unsure about his plans for the fall. “I can’t surely finalize what my exact plans are for the semester,” he said, “but I’ll most likely be taking online classes while staying in Boston. However, if the situation in the US begins to improve by the beginning of the semester, I could potentially attend some smaller in-person classes later on.”
A rising junior, Anica Abaquin is another international student from the Philippines. However, she is back in the Philippines and has decided to remain there for the semester. Abaquin said, “Making the decision to not return to Boston was a very hard, and frankly, upsetting process for me. As a rising junior, I am aware of the limited time I have left not only in college but also in the United States.”
“This pandemic has been a tough journey for all college students,” she added, “but I think that it has had the most impact on international college students. Returning to Boston is a greater challenge for us because of the long travel flights, ever-changing travel restrictions, fear of racism, and the difficulty of being so far away from the comfort of your family in the event that you get sick. On top of that, there are many obstacles we are confronted with from governmental policies and restrictions.”
Though she has decided to take her classes online while home in the Philippines, it was a difficult choice to make. Taking classes in person was not an option for her due to the risk of exposure to Covid-19 while being surrounded by so many people. The decision to take a gap semester seemed unlikely due to not being eligible for an OPT or CPT work authorization if she did not take two consecutive summers of full-time registration at school. Moreover, wanting to graduate on-time was a huge factor, and not all courses are offered in the summer to be able to do so. “There are many other factors I weighed out but ultimately, I decided that taking classes remotely is what would work best for my future plans,” Abaquin said.
Regardless of their individual circumstances, college students have been frustrated by a number of factors. “I’m honestly infuriated at how long it’s taking for a wealthy country like the U.S. to get things under control,” Cheng said. “The whole situation should’ve been quelled months ago, but it only seems to get worse due to the incompetence of people in power and the neglect of many ignorant people.”
Regarding plans for the upcoming semester, Abaquin said, “As with any case, there are still a lot of unanswered questions, but I suspect them to address these concerns in the upcoming month leading to the beginning of classes. In my opinion, the biggest challenge for universities isn’t in this period of preparation, rather it is in the opening of classes and how they will quickly respond and deal with crisis management.”

20200807,2020 Census takers will be going door-to-door this month as the push is on to get household members to respond,"Chinatown and Asians in Boston showing a low response rate
If you haven’t responded to the 2020 Census questionnaire, then you could hear a knock on your door this month. The deadline for completing the U.S. Census Bureau questionnaire was extended three months because of the Covid-19 pandemic to Oct. 31, but that date has been cut back a month, and now will end Sept. 30.
However, the Census Bureau is not waiting for households to voluntarily participate; it’s go-time for them to get household members to respond in communities where the numbers are low – like Chinatown.
The challenge for census trackers is to get the most historically difficult groups to respond, which in the inner cities includes immigrants, homeless people, and renters. In the 2010 Census, millions of people were omitted from the census because they did not participate.
Lewis Liu, who is originally from Guangzhou, China, is the Supervisory Partnership Specialist for the New York Regional Census Center, responsible for the Chinese community. He is also fluent in Mandarin and Cantonese and was hired in October of last year for his new role to oversee the census work in Chinese and Asian communities. Liu spoke to Sampan in a phone interview. He said that in Boston more than 120 bilingual English and Chinese speaking (both mandarin and Cantonese) census takers are ready to begin door-to-door work.
For the U.S. as a whole, the census count has reported a 62.6 percent response rate, amounting to 92.5 million households, online, by phone, or by mail. The Massachusetts response rate as of July 26 was 64.6 percent, two percentage points better than the national average, and ranks 20th out of 50 states. Boston’s response rate was 52.9 percent. Within the country, cities with more than 500,000 populations, Boston ranks 35th out of 39 cities.
Boston census tract for Chinatown is 51.8 percent, lower than the City of Boston as a whole. As of July 1, 2019, 692,600 are the population base of Boston, and the Asian community represents 9.6 percent, but there’s no specific breakdown of the different Asian groups.
One of the questions in the census allows for ethnicity to be identified. The self-identifying question has been asked since the 2000 census. The same question appears on the American Committee Survey, a random survey sent out every year.
“We encourage everyone to self-identify on a voluntary basis,” Liu said. “We need to comply with the Civil Rights Act. So we want to make sure that all communities are fairly represented because those numbers will be used for redistricting. The census data will be presented to Congress and all the states. Especially in the states, they will use the data for redistricting purposes.”
He added that federal funds are also affected by the census data and how federal money will be allocated around the country in individual states and cities. As for the questionnaire itself, the questions are straightforward and quick to answer.
“Every household, we ask for the primary person for the household to answer the questionnaire,” Liu said. “The first question would be: How many people live in this household? And then the second question is of the ownership of this household; do you live here at this address? Do you own it or are you renting it, or is somebody providing it for free? Then the next question is for your phone number, sometimes for quality assurance purpose we may call back to make sure all the questions are answered properly. And then the next question we ask the primary person’s name, gender, date of birth. And then the next question is whether you are Hispanic: Mexican, Puerto Rican, Columbian, Guatemala, etc. And the next question is for race, and you can either enter white, black Native American, or Alaska. For Asians, we have Chinese, Vietnamese, Korean, Asian Indian, Japanese. And we provide spaces for anyone to write-in if that person does not see anything in the check box.”
As for information gathered by the Census Bureau, no personal data can be disclosed to other federal agencies as stated under Article 13 of U.S. federal law. Liu stressed that no questions such as citizenship status, what kind of passport the individual holds, credit card or bank accounts, language spoken, income earned, how long someone has lived in the country, none of these questions will be asked. Last year the Supreme Court ruled that no question can be asked in the census regarding citizenship.
Census takers will begin door-to-door work on Aug. 11 in Boston. Every census taker will have a photo badge, clearly identifying them, and a bag with a Census Bureau local name on it. And because of the coronavirus pandemic, all census takers will remain outside and stay six feet away, and wear a mask. They will also be using an iPad to fill out the questionnaire, which takes between 5-10 minutes. Because the Census Bureau is not a law enforcement agency, they can only request that the household member participate as mandated by the Constitution.
“It’s for their own benefit and also for the community, for the city, and state,” Liu stressed. “It boils down to political representation and also the federal spending; hundreds of billions of dollars of federal spending for the next ten year. Ten minutes for the next ten years, that’s the message we want to communicate to all members in every community. Ten minutes of your time for the next ten years is for yourself, for your family, for your children, for your community, and for your city.”

20200807,Virtual summer youth music program experiences high enrollment; fall music education plan awaits guidance from state,"By Christine McCue
As Massachusetts schools formulate fall reopening plans, and music educators await their own specialized guidance, at least one Boston program is being kept busy this summer with virtual classes for school-aged children.
Not long after the last day of school in June, more than 60 Boston children ages 5-12 had enrolled in the virtual Creative Summer program, developed and managed by the Josiah Quincy Orchestra Program (JQOP), a non-profit, school-based organization that serves Boston families. JQOP was able to create the summer program quickly thanks to having a remote infrastructure already in place since March when it was forced to move all music classes and lessons online for 250 children after Boston Public Schools shut down.
“For the past nine years, the heart of our program has been focused on providing an orchestra experience for Boston’s most vulnerable youth as a way to nurture individual expression, celebrate unique cultures, and develop social-emotional skills,” said JQOP Executive Director Chris Schroeder. “And even though Covid-19 forced us to change our traditional orchestra model, we’ve been able to quickly pivot to online classes that students and parents love, while continuing to engage youth in creative music projects into the summer months.”
Beth Harper is a parent of two elementary school children in Boston Public Schools and is also a Boston pediatrician who appreciates JQOP and the benefits it provides.
“Our children continue to have a great experience with JQOP, and that includes the Creative Summer program,” said Harper. “Music education has played an especially important and positive mental-health role during the pandemic. It fosters connections, and can be a creative outlet that helps children discover a passion, relieve stress, and find comfort at an otherwise frightening time.”
Building on the success of its school-year program, the Creative Summer program is organized into hour-long morning or afternoon classes that run five days a week in July and will continue into August. Age-appropriate classes are held virtually via Zoom with group lessons on a variety of topics, including music composition, improvisation, music technology, and doodling to music. Each student also receives private instrument lessons with teaching artists who are typically conservatory-trained musicians and music educators who normally perform regularly throughout Boston.
“The teaching artists are invaluable,” said Harper. “They’re trusted adult role models who can help children overcome all kinds of obstacles. It’s been wonderful to have our kids’ connection with them extend beyond the school year and into the summer.”
Looking ahead to the fall, Schroeder joins other Massachusetts music educators awaiting guidance from the state on what is possible for the upcoming school year in the midst of Covid-19, but it’s clear that youth music ensembles will continue to be presented with unique challenges, and he believes at least some virtual instruction is inevitable. Regardless of what will be required, Schroeder feels confident that JQOP is well positioned to meet the needs of students and families.
Erik Holmgren, program manager of Creative Youth Development for Massachusetts Cultural Council, agrees. “As music and education has undergone a seismic shift in program delivery due to Covid-19, the Josiah Quincy Orchestra Program has taken a leadership role in taking effective steps to continue to carry out its mission,” said Holmgren. “It has tapped into the artistic and educational expertise of the staff, young people, and the community to create an online learning environment that is defined by its assets, and not what is lacking.”
In an effort to help the school planning process across the U.S., the National Association for Music Education and National Federation of State High School Associations recently issued a report to help guide music educators on everything from scheduling, instrument demonstrations, and virtual instruction. In addition, more than 100 performing arts organizations have commissioned a study on the effects of Covid-19 to better understand what risks exist in performing arts classrooms and performance venues. Schroeder added, “While the Covid-19 pandemic has challenged our communities in unimaginable ways, it has tested our resiliency and allowed our team to demonstrate how we can work together to overcome adversity.”
Schroeder noted that an Aug. 13 virtual showcase of student work is planned for 7 p.m. Details will be posted on the JQOP website at:  jqop.org.
The Josiah Quincy Orchestra Program  was founded in 2011 as a non-profit, creative youth development organization that uses an intensive and unique ensemble-based music curriculum to help underserved children develop the skills necessary to succeed at school and in life. In partnership with Boston Public Schools and community groups across the City of Boston, it provides a variety of music programming serving more than 260 children ages 4-14 annually.

In addition, her decision was heavily influenced by the tuition costs for online and virtual classes. “By going completely virtual, Harvard College is now essentially an overpriced version of the Harvard Extension School,” Chang said. “Looking up their tuition and cost of attendance, a full semester at HES for 16 credits (4 courses) would total to less than $20,000 without any financial aid; yet the college is still charging $67,000 for essentially the same thing.”
“I personally think Harvard could have done a much better job in every aspect,” said Chang. For instance, forcing people to move without offering financial support has become a huge problem. Both shipping items home and keeping them in storage would cost hundreds of dollars that not everyone can afford. Moreover, she said that students would have preferred tuition reductions over “enforcing universal pass/fail, which the majority of the student body actually voted against, and allowing more than one class year back on campus in the fall.”
Moreover, Chang said, “The College held several ‘town halls’ but never once allowed audience questions and almost always delivered absolutely no useful information besides constantly promoting the fact that they had set up planning teams and were trying their best. Although they set up a few focus groups with students and sent out surveys to decide what to do for the fall semester, the majority of us did not feel heard and that they weren’t really taking our opinions into account.”
Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)
Like Harvard, MIT has elected to go online for the fall semester. However, seniors are prioritized to return to campus in order to complete their coursework in time to graduate. According to MIT News, they will not be moving forward with the planned tuition increase this year. Undergraduates will also be receiving a grant of $5,000 as well as reduced dining costs by 40 percent.
Kevin Lu is a rising junior at MIT. “MIT’s plans for the upcoming semester are to only have seniors and a select few exempted other students,” he said. “I’m not sure how many seniors elected to stay on campus, but I think 212 students were granted exemptions.”
While he is not sure how classes and research will proceed, Lu is particularly disappointed about the cancelation of a capstone mechanical engineering course where students design and launch a product. “My original plans were to carry on with my degree and also continue training with my Lightweight rowing team, but now I’ll just be taking classes online at home alone,” Lu said. “I decided this because I don’t want to delay my education, and I also don’t think there is something as productive I could do if I were to defer.”
“This whole situation is unfortunate, and I wish the U.S. was better able to contain the virus’s spread like other countries did,” Lu said. “I am not a fan of their response mostly because other schools are opening up.”
Boston University (BU)
Unlike Harvard and MIT, Boston University has chosen to open up campus for returning students and adopt a hybrid model that allows students to take classes remotely or in-person. BU set up a “Back2BU” website that lists extensive details on how BU will proceed with the upcoming semester, including test protocols as well as life on campus.
Sean Cheng, an international student from the Philippines, has been in Boston since the pandemic. According to Cheng, BU has been contacting students regarding their plans for the fall. “I know that we’re given the option to either take in-person classes, online classes, or a mix of both. They’ve been releasing protocols for the upcoming semester and how they’ll be strictly implementing testing locations across campus and social distancing policies to ensure the safety of staff, students, and faculty,” he said. “According to the latest update, we’ve been informed that all students will be required through a digital agreement to comply with wearing face coverings, daily symptoms attestation, routine and frequent testing, contact tracing, quarantine, and isolation.”
While Cheng is disappointed in how his senior year is turning out, he is still unsure about his plans for the fall. “I can’t surely finalize what my exact plans are for the semester,” he said, “but I’ll most likely be taking online classes while staying in Boston. However, if the situation in the US begins to improve by the beginning of the semester, I could potentially attend some smaller in-person classes later on.”
A rising junior, Anica Abaquin is another international student from the Philippines. However, she is back in the Philippines and has decided to remain there for the semester. Abaquin said, “Making the decision to not return to Boston was a very hard, and frankly, upsetting process for me. As a rising junior, I am aware of the limited time I have left not only in college but also in the United States.”
“This pandemic has been a tough journey for all college students,” she added, “but I think that it has had the most impact on international college students. Returning to Boston is a greater challenge for us because of the long travel flights, ever-changing travel restrictions, fear of racism, and the difficulty of being so far away from the comfort of your family in the event that you get sick. On top of that, there are many obstacles we are confronted with from governmental policies and restrictions.”
Though she has decided to take her classes online while home in the Philippines, it was a difficult choice to make. Taking classes in person was not an option for her due to the risk of exposure to Covid-19 while being surrounded by so many people. The decision to take a gap semester seemed unlikely due to not being eligible for an OPT or CPT work authorization if she did not take two consecutive summers of full-time registration at school. Moreover, wanting to graduate on-time was a huge factor, and not all courses are offered in the summer to be able to do so. “There are many other factors I weighed out but ultimately, I decided that taking classes remotely is what would work best for my future plans,” Abaquin said.
Regardless of their individual circumstances, college students have been frustrated by a number of factors. “I’m honestly infuriated at how long it’s taking for a wealthy country like the U.S. to get things under control,” Cheng said. “The whole situation should’ve been quelled months ago, but it only seems to get worse due to the incompetence of people in power and the neglect of many ignorant people.”
Regarding plans for the upcoming semester, Abaquin said, “As with any case, there are still a lot of unanswered questions, but I suspect them to address these concerns in the upcoming month leading to the beginning of classes. In my opinion, the biggest challenge for universities isn’t in this period of preparation, rather it is in the opening of classes and how they will quickly respond and deal with crisis management.”

20200724,AACA recognizes 2 partners for leadership and support in the community,"ABCD president and CEO John Drew received the Social Justice Award at last year’s Asian American Civic Association annual Gala fundraiser. (Photo Courtesy of Ling-Mei Wong)
On July 30, the Asian American Civic Association will host its annual Gala fundraiser, Their Courage to be New, virtually, to celebrate the successes of the nonprofit and its clients and students over the past year. The Gala also will serve as an exclamation point on AACA’s crowdfunding campaign that is bringing in vital general operating dollars that go directly to support AACA’s highly successful job training programs, social support services, and English as Speakers of Other Languages classes. These programs empower the most at need among the immigrant and low-income communities of greater Boston, helping them access new and better lives.
As part of the Gala, AACA will be recognizing two partners that have provided leadership over the past year and enabled AACA to run some of the most successful job training and community programs in the area. AACA will be presenting Casella Resource Solutions with the Employer Partner of the Year and Tufts Medical Center with the Employer Partner of the Year and Community Hero award.
Casella has been integral to AACA’s efforts to launch next generation job training programs. Casella signed on as one of the first employer partners of AACA’s Green Automotive Maintenance Skills (GAMS) pilot program. This program takes individuals stuck in a dead end and places them into a career path as a diesel technician.  Diesel techs start at an average $25 per hour, with the potential to earn promotions up to a six figure salary as quickly as within two years.
In addition to funding training seats, Kelley Robinson, Casella Vice President of Human Resources, collaborated with Edward Hsieh, AACA COO, on curriculum design and mapping out career pathways for the GAMS program. This partnership enabled AACA to launch a new program in an unprecedented six months. “Working with AACA is a great business decision. Their mission of developing talented people aligned perfectly with Casella’s goal of providing opportunity for all types of people,” said Kelley.
Tufts Medical Center has been a steadfast partner of AACA for decades.  AACA works with Tufts to provide workplace education to its incumbent employees. By providing ESOL and job readiness classes to entry-level Tuft’s employees, AACA and Tufts empower those workers to move into higher paying positions and career pathways to greater stability.
In addition, Tufts directly collaborates with AACA on the Asian Health Initiative, which tackles challenging health issues faced by Chinatown, such as the disproportionate impact on Asians related to smoking. Tufts also places a social worker in AACA’s Multi-Service Center to help provide social support and public benefits to the community.
During the current pandemic, Tufts Medical Center has kept its doors open, providing countless tests and direct care to members of the community. Tufts has also continued directly injecting support into the community, even providing AACA with a grant to procure equipment to enable AACA’s job training programs to continue remotely at a high level. Mike Apkon, Tufts Medical Center President and CEO, expressed his support for AACA’s “goal of providing economic self-sufficiency and mobility to help people not only survive, but thrive, and we’re proud to support the overall wellness and health of the community.”
AACA is the 501c3 nonprofit that provides education and job training to the most at need among the immigrant and low-income populations around Greater Boston to empower them to find a better career and self-sufficient future.  AACA has serves over 4,000 individuals originating from over 85 countries every year.  AACA provides ESOL, social support services, and job training programs offering pathways into careers in banking, building maintenance, construction, and diesel fleet maintenance.

20200724,The Greenway News: The Greenway Conservancy’s Public Art Program allows pedestrians to view contemporary works of art while strolling through Boston,"The Greenway Conservancy’s Public Art Program has paved the way for The Greenway to become a premier destination to see contemporary works of art in downtown Boston. The public art vision is to bring innovative and contemporary art to Boston through free, temporary exhibitions, engaging people in meaningful experiences, interactions and dialogue with art and each other.

A Mouse with Ears and Tail, a neon light sculpture on view on above a waterfall on the Serpentine Path near the Chinatown gate, was commissioned from local artist Furen Dai as part of the Conservancy’s annual zodiac animal series. With the aim of celebrating both past and present, each year a new artwork has been installed by the Conservancy in front of the Essex Street Gate for the past six years. For her artwork based on the Year of the Mouse, Dai researched the evolutionary process of the Chinese character “鼠” (mouse) from the ancient oracle bone script to the contemporary SimSun font.

When foreign language characters are placed in a different cultural context, those without knowledge of the language tend to read the character as a series of abstract lines and shapes. This artwork explores the experience of viewing a Chinese character from both a native and foreign perspective, encouraging both Chinese speakers and non-Chinese speakers to see “mouse” when viewing “鼠”.  In this work, the small mouse of the ancient Oracle bone script races around the contemporary SimSun font, which is in turn transformed into a cartoon mouse figure blinking and beckoning us in with its warm, neon glow.
Nearby at the Lincoln Street Triangle on The Greenway, Juan Travieso’s mural, Engulf, addresses the challenges brought by gentrification and climate change. Travieso’s piece was installed in 2019 in partnership with the Punto Urban Arts Museum in Salem, Massachusetts.
This summer, the Conservancy is proud to update the community on Lantern Stories, a community based artwork by artist Yu-Wen Wu. Chosen by a community jury, Yu-Wen’s work celebrates Boston’s Chinatown community, illuminating its resilient history and enduring hope for the future during these unprecedented times.
Further along The Greenway, the Conservancy recently announced the installation of new artwork by renowned British-Nigerian artist Yinka Shonibare. In his artwork, Shonibare explores colonialism and post-colonialism within the contemporary context of globalization. The Conservancy has commissioned a new Wind Sculpture (SG) V, which is exhibited in a contemplative garden on The Greenway, just north of Dewey Square. The 22-foot-tall sculpture features a new variation of Shonibare’s trademark batik that appears to harness the wind and freeze it in a moment of time. Batik, which we now regard as traditional African cloth, is based on Indonesian batik fabric first brought to Africa by Dutch traders in the 1800s. Throughout Shonibare’s work, the material serves as a metaphor for our contemporary cultures, which, like the “African” batik, are the result of centuries of cross-cultural exchange. By referencing both this hybrid fabric and the powerful yet invisible nature of wind, the work suggests that identity is always a richly layered and dynamic set of relationships, while evoking a sense of freedom, possibility, and optimism.

Installed in June, Catalina Delgado-Trunk’s work, Global Connections: Mesoamerican Myths, the Domestication of Nourishment, and its Distribution, focuses on our interconnectedness through themes of food culture and immigration. Located on The Greenway Light Blades, Delgado-Trunk’s world renowned papel picado (cut paper) artwork illustrates Mesoamerican mythology, histories of food trade, and the foundational elements of all our lives.
In his monumental mural at Dewey Square, international artist Super A questions the social, political, and emotional systems that confine our freedom in Resonance. The Conservancy’s Augmented Reality (AR) exhibit blends interactive digital elements into our real-world environments through the overlay of historical imagery and contemporary art responding to the ever-changing nature of what once was a major transportation corridor through downtown Boston. Through a curatorial partnership with Boston Cyberarts and Hoverlay, the Conservancy commissioned three prominent AR artists and historian Amy D. Finstein; the works may be viewed on The Greenway or in your own living room or backyard through the Conservancy’s #BringTheGreenwayHome initiative through August.

Nearby on Dewey Square, City Winery on The Greenway opened for the season on July 15, serving wine from City Winery Boston and cider and beer from Harpoon Brewery. Our Greenway Food Truck Program is on a limited schedule and the Boston Public Market at Dewey Square has returned for the season, once again bringing locally-sourced food to those who live or work downtown from local farmers and small businesses. Farmer’s market vendors are proud to accept SNAP/EBT and HIP for all eligible products.
Further along The Greenway, our Greenway Open Market takes place every Saturday and first and third Sundays of the month and the Greenway Carousel at the Tiffany & Co. Foundation Grove is operating on a limited weekend schedule. All Greenway programming features enhanced cleaning and physical distancing procedures to promote safety for our park visitors.

20200724,Food for Thought: Delightful seafood at a Winthrop gem – Belle Isle Seafood restaurant,"One restaurant on my local must try bucket list is Winthrop’s gem Belle Isle Seafood restaurant. Current owner Jim Costin moved the business from their original East Boston 883 square feet space that served seafood for many years to their current 5,000 square feet industrial digs just over the Winthrop border in 2012. This spot is ideal to get unparalleled views of the Boston skyline, Logan Airport, Zakim Bridge and the Bunker Hill Monument. People travel all over to try their famous lobster rolls, which includes actress Mila Kunis amongst its fans. Even the late Anthony Bourdain visited their old East Boston spot in 2011 for his “No Reservations” TV show. He shared his appreciation for the simple décor, pure focus on fresh and tasty food that locals and tourists alike have come to love.
We arrived hungry after working up an appetite after our walk at nearby Deer Island Reservation. The dining room at one side had a full bar and television on the sports channel. Our friendly server told us the QR code to scan to get the weekend menu show up on our smart phone. Ravenous, we ordered the clam chowder, their famous lobster roll, the fisherman’s platter, and a side order of crab cakes.
We were first served their clam chowders ($4.99 for a cup) available on a seasonal basis. The cup came with oysters crackers. There were plenty of potatoes and clams with the proper amount of seasoning. For our personal preference, we wished the chowder was a tad bit thicker in consistency.
The author enjoys a medley of delicious and traditional Boston seafood dishes at Belle Isle Seafood in Winthrop: Fisherman’s platter, New England clam chowder, crab cakes, and lobster roll. 
Next to the table was the award winning lobster meat roll ($28.99) (another option is the $33.99 lobster tail roll). A tall and generous heap of fresh and sweet lobster meat (made with ¼ lb. of  knuckle meat and ¼ lobster tail with a touch of mayo) over a crisp and fresh iceberg lettuce in a hot dog bun with a side of coleslaw appeared before our stunned eyes. All the accolades are true: tons of gorgeous lobster meat highlighted by its simplicity with mayo was heavenly. The coleslaw was simple but tasty.
The crab cakes appetizer ($14.99 for three) came served with a choice of tartar sauce and cocktail sauce. Each crab cake was full of tender and sweet crab meat with minimal bread crumbs (unlike the usual style found in the Boston area) which were a tad bit saltier than expected.
Finally, the long awaited Fisherman’s Platter chock full of haddock, scallops, shrimp and fried clams ($26.99) with a tall mountain of crispy onion rings. We opted for another coleslaw and passed on the usual French fries served with it. As with the rest of our meal, everything was very fresh, tasty with a light and crispy layer of batter. The scallops were sweet, the haddock nice and flaky, and the fried clams with full bellies were sensational.
Service was friendly and attentive. Remember to bring cash and if you forget, there is an ATM machine nearby. We could see why this local favorite is worth the trek to Winthrop. Fresh and delicious seafood with generous portions, we were so full that we needed another walk after our lunch. We made sure to take in and marvel at the gorgeous views of Boston and the planes departing and arriving into Logan. If you are in the area, do check out Belle Island Seafood.

20200724,"In an already vulnerable business sector, Black restaurant owners battle to stay open","At this very moment when the Black Lives Matter movement nationwide encountered the long-lasting Covid-19 pandemic, the situations of small local businesses, especially Black-owned businesses, have been brought to the forefront of public awareness.
The restaurant industry in Mass. is approaching $5 billion in lost sales, and 200,000 employees have been laid off since the state government shuttered dine-in business for bars and restaurants March 17, according to Steve Clark, the Director of Government Affairs at Massachusetts Restaurant Association (MRA), in an interview with Sampan on July 1.
Among those who are impacted, black-owned bars and restaurants are particularly vulnerable. According to a press release by Boston Black Hospitality Coalition (BBHC), Boston’s Black-owned bars and restaurants have lost more than 90 percent of their revenue amidst the Covid-19 crisis, and 88 percent of the workforce, primarily people of color, were laid off during this crisis, affecting 116 households.
Some of the businesses closed permanently, “like a candle that burns out,” expressed Theodora Skeadas, Executive Director of Cambridge Local First (CLF). Some survived, with the help and care from local organizations made up with committed individuals.
“Being a small restaurant owner is very hard,” Clark said. “You don’t have staff, you don’t have an attorney, you don’t have an HR professional; you don’t have any of these things that other businesses have. And that’s a struggle that every restaurant owner faces. It doesn’t matter where they’re located, or what their makeup is.”
Located in Dorchester, Restaurante Cesaria features traditional Cape Verdean cuisine and occasional live music. Opened in 2002, co-owners, Tony Barros and Jose Fonseca-Brandao, believed that they could fill the vacancy of authentic culture for Cape Verdeans in Boston. They purchased an alcohol license from a friend and got it transferred after six years of successful management, proving itself to the community as a respectable business bringing good to the community.

At the time it was easier to get the license in certain areas, “but if you didn’t have that, it would be virtually impossible to get anything,” said Tony Barros, co-owner of Cesaria. They are fortunate that they were able to purchase the license with the approval of the licensing board at City of Boston, although they had to pay in installments when they bought it, and they are still paying, he said.
Looking back at operating Cesaria’s past 19 years, Barros described the process as a roller coaster. The pandemic reminded him of the period after 9/11, when people stopped going out, and it was tough to keep the business running. To maintain the business during the shutdown, Cesaria utilized delivery apps and got more orders. They added Grubhub besides the original two delivery company partners, Ubereats and Doordash, Barros said. The delivery services have worked out well, and even brought them new customers, from the analytical data Barros got on those delivery applications.
Cesaria was also in partnerships with different organizations including Commonwealth Kitchen, YMCA Dorchester, Cape Verdean Association of Boston, and provided food for the elders and people in need. “We did at a very low cost, but still, those things kept us afloat during the pandemic,” Barros said.
Liquor license fees, rental costs, a variety of local and state taxes: Small business owners have to take into account all kinds of fees at the beginning of their business, and they still pay even during the pandemic. “The reality is small and micro businesses will have to go through all these little things, where a bigger chain of operations will be kind of like a drop in the bucket,” said Faarooq Sahabdeen, Director of Communication of BBHC.
Having recognized the emergency facing black-owned restaurants and bars like Restaurante Cesaria, BBHC was created during the pandemic in partnership with the NAACP Boston branch, who provided them the initial grant. It’s made up of five of eight black liquor licensed restaurants and bars in the city. They call for actions from elected officials, local organizations, and neighborhood residents to ensure the future of Boston’s Black-owned hospitality industry, and ultimately preserve their legacy of over 180 years in Boston’s Black communities, noted in the release.
The basic goal of BBHC is not only to create the fund that help its five members go through the pandemic, but also relocate the money, which comprises funds from individual donations through the website link and fundraising activities, and help other minority-owned businesses in the community, Sahabdeen said.
It’s noted in the release on the BBHC website that there are eight black liquor licensed restaurants and bars in Boston, compared with over 1,200 liquor licenses given out; 83 percent of these businesses are in Roxbury; 75 percent of the customer base are people of color.
“These businesses represent almost a mirror image of the community,” Sahabdeen said. Districts including Roxbury, Dorchester and Jamaica Plain are where the neighborhoods of Black community is, he said.
The difficulties that black-owned businesses are facing speak to an existing structural problem. For example, they do not have their own properties, neither can they afford the rent in downtown areas. When applying for loans, immigrant business owners don’t have the long-standing bank relationship, and they struggle to navigate the complicated process.
“We always had trouble getting loans from the banks,” said Barros. “We tried to purchase the building that we were in and we weren’t able to purchase it,” he said. “We needed a capital even if it wasn’t that big.”
Cesaria’s owners had to go through cash advance, a short-term loan from a bank, which lends applicants money at high interest. The advantage is that the merchants can get money in short notice based on their credit card income, but then they could get stuck with the high interest, Barros said.
During the pandemic, voices of support and help have come within and outside the black community. And nonprofit organizations like CLF make their down-to-earth contributions.
CLF is a nonprofit network of locally owned and independent businesses, formed in October 2005. Through various campaigns, trainings, and media exposures, they seek to promote the importance of “Local Economy Community” by educating the public and government.
“An economy cannot thrive when a group of people experience fear and stress walking down the street, when they cannot breathe,” it was stated on the CLF website posted on May 27. “Our work does not end with words of support or acknowledgement that Black Lives Matter.”
Their efforts include mentoring programs, which started in June. During the meetings, business owners are offered a series of training on traditional banks, and instructed on how to access loans as well as venture capitalists, etc.
CLF has also been helping black-owned businesses increase their media presence through promotions on social media like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and their newsletters.
“I would say a lot of our black business owners are doing more with less,” Skeadas said. CLF wants to offer help under the umbrella of a business owner, and foster their leadership, which could help make sure the service is offered in the right place. However, trying to find time for everyone and help identify available resources itself poses a big challenge, since those owners have many responsibilities with extremely busy schedules, she said.
Responding to the nationwide Black Lives Matter movement, CLF added a live map indicating black-owned businesses statewide, on the basis of an existing map about local businesses in Cambridge, which was built to help local businesses go through the pandemic.
On the map, visitors can enter the area they live in, and find the information of black-owned businesses nearby, including their names, websites, addresses, social media, etc.
Daniel Wang is a volunteer at CLF, and he directly participated in building the black-owned businesses map. Before that, he and his friends built a website called Covid Biz Link, which is like a clearinghouse for volunteers and small businesses.
Wang has family in Shenzhen, China, and he knows how seriously a local business can be impacted by the coronavirus. “Small restaurants like my childhood favorites, where I used to spend my birthday parties, they closed down,” he said. “That really impacted me.”
As a high-school student interested in computer science, Wang self-taught related skills and feels it’s worthwhile to devote his time and expertise into something that really helps his community.
There are other Black-owned business lists and directories on the Internet, “but from what I know so far, I have a sense that we have one of, if not the most, complete and diverse map, Wan said. “And that’s something that we’re proud to have.”
Seated in the weekly meetings and seeing the community come together is powerful, Wang said, and he encourages people to be kind to neighbors, to strangers outside of their communities, disregard of their identities, or the differences and misconceptions they have had, he said.
“When you see injustice in this world, that may not be affecting you, consider how it would feel if other people have helped you during your time of need, and just try to extend your hand in that way,” Wang said.
The quote from Barros concerning the purchase of an alcohol license was changed from the original quote for accuracy on July 27, 2020.

20200710,"Ruby Foo, Chinatown’s first woman restaurateur (Part 2)","Let me continue the tale of the admirable Ruby Foo. Her restaurant in Chinatown opened around 1929 and the first advertisement I found for it was in the Boston Globe, July 2, 1935. The restaurant, known as Ruby Foo at The Den, offered “delicious Chinese Foods” and it was open until 4 a.m. It was said that Ruby Foo originally presented Cantonese food for the Chinese community, but eventually, the quality of her food enticed non-Chinese to dine there.
Ruby’s restaurant was so successful during the 1930s that she was approached to open a second location in New York City. Joe Pike and his wife Florence (who was from Boston) used to travel frequently and dined at numerous Chinese restaurants. They were impressed with what Ruby Foo had created, and proposed a partnership to her to open a similar restaurant in New York, using the same Cantonese recipes. This second location opened at 240 West 52nd Street, just off Broadway, in October 1936. This was probably the first Chinatown restaurant to open a second location outside of Massachusetts, and this occurred within only about seven years of the start of Ruby’s business.
In July 1939, it was noted that Ruby now offered a Chinese food delivery service, within a reasonable radius. This is one of first mentions of a Chinese restaurant in the Boston area offering delivery service, and it’s possible that she introduced this development to Boston’s Chinatown.
Ruby’s fame was mentioned in the Lowell Sun, Aug. 24, 1940, noting, “The only international chain of American-Chinese restaurants in the world is operated by Mrs. Ruby Foo, a diminutive Chinese from San Francisco. She has restaurants in New York, Boston, London, and, of course, at the New York World’s Fair.” The article also mentioned one of Ruby’s hobbies, “During her off hours Mrs. Foo goes in for solo flying.”  So, not only did she run a restaurant empire and raise three children, but she also learned how to fly a plane.
It’s also interesting to know that up through the 1940s, her restaurant never had a liquor license, yet still did great business, appealing to many celebrities. In the Boston Globe, Sept. 10, 1945, it was stated that after the nightclubs in Boston closed at 1a.m., theatrical workers and entertainers would go to Ruby Foo’s. She was beloved in the entertainment industry, and all across the country. They were the ones who helped to spread the popularity of her restaurant. Ruby was described as “jolly, good-natured, with laughing almond eyes and lips that smile easily.”
In 1948, Florence Pike opened the first Chinese canning factory in the U.S. producing canned Ruby Foo Oriental food products. Chefs from Ruby Foo’s tested and experimented on creating excellent Chinese foods that could be canned. Great care was taken in the preparation of all of these foods, including using quality ingredients. Some of the cans included Chicken Chow Mein, Vegetable Chow Mein, Mushroom Egg Drop Soup and Noodles.
Though the Ruby Foo food empire was going very well, it would suffer a terrible tragedy. Ruby Foo passed away suddenly at home on March 16, 1950 from a heart attack. She had recently spent five months in a hospital for treatment of her heart condition. A life cut far too short. According to the Boston Globe, March 16, 1950, Ruby’s alleged last words to her nurse were, “Call me a 1:30 (a.m.). I want to call the restaurant.” That is certainly dedication to her passion.
Despite Ruby’s passing, her restaurant continued to operate under the management of two of her children, Doris Shong and Earl Shong. During the 1950s, Ruby Foo’s Den remained immensely popular, especially with celebrities, from comedians to sports figures. And the newspapers were very complimentary to how Doris and Earl were handling the restaurant. However, the restaurant finally closed in July 1957.
Ruby Foo is commemorated in Boston as part of The Boston Women’s Heritage Trail. In addition, back in the summer of 2019, the Chinese Historical Society of New England worked with the Boston City Archaeology Program on the first archaeological dig in Chinatown. They spent about three weeks, digging in a vacant lot, which once had been the home to Ruby Foo’s Den. The Hudson Street building was torn down in 1989. Unfortunately, once they had dug down about six-and-a-half feet, they hit the water table and had to cease their activities for safety reasons.
The story of Ruby Foo is a powerful tale of an intelligent, charismatic and savvy businesswoman who became a success in the restaurant industry, and introduced many people to the wonders of Chinese cuisine. Plus, she succeeded during difficult times, from the Great Depression to World War II. Who knows what she might have accomplished if she had only lived longer. Many kudos to the memory of Ruby Foo!

The Greenway is the contemporary public park in the heart of Boston, stretching 1.5 miles from Chinatown to the North End. The Greenway welcomes millions of visitors annually to gather, play, unwind, and explore. The Greenway Conservancy is the non-profit responsible for the management and care of The Greenway. Starting this week, we are delighted to bring a regular column to Sampan to provide updates on The Greenway and work of the Conservancy.
As the Commonwealth and City of Boston continue phased reopening, residents and visitors are encouraged to safely visit the park; the Greenway Conservancy has taken special precautions amidst the coronavirus and encourages all park visitors to practice physical distancing, good hygiene, and caution.

Ongoing projects in Chinatown include the Conservancy’s bamboo renovation project, the transplanting and new plantings in the Serpentine Path area to improve the sightlines for safety, and work on the irrigation systems that keep everything watered. We have delayed the return of most of the movable tables and chairs to the park in an effort to stem the spread of Covid-19.
As we continue into Phase 2 of reopening, the Conservancy has reopened our Greenway PlayCubes, closed in in late March, for children with a supervising adult. Additionally, the Conservancy this week began to turn on our fountains across the park, including the Chinatown Stream along the Serpentine Path.
Nearby on Dewey Square, our Greenway Food Truck Program has returned on a limited schedule and the Boston Public Market at Dewey Square has returned for the season, once again bringing locally-sourced food to those who live or work downtown from local farmers and small businesses. The food trucks and farmers market have enhanced cleaning and physical distancing procedures to promote safety for our park visitors; farmers market vendors are proud to accept SNAP/EBT and HIP for all eligible products.
“During these challenging times; the Conservancy’s priorities are the health and safety of our visitors, staff, and partners on The Greenway,” said Greenway Conservancy Executive Director Jesse Brackenbury.  “As we continue with the phased reopening in the park, we will continue to provide dynamic open spaces, contemporary public art, and local food options that are essential to everyone who shares our city.”

20200710,"Tufts Medical Center grants $300,000 Covid-19 Relief Fund to organizations serving local Asian communities","In response to requests for funding from community-based organizations (CBOs), Tufts Medical Center donated $300,000 as part of their Covid-19 relief efforts in early May. This grant was geared towards CBOs serving communities in Chinatown, Dorchester, and South Boston. The goal is to “lead by example, and encourage them to support local businesses while supporting residents where possible,” said Sherry Dong, Director of Community Health Improvement Programs at Tufts Medical Center.
Earlier in the pandemic, Tufts Medical Center distributed more than 500 wellness kits and provided Covid testing to hundreds of community residents at the Josiah Quincy School and at local housing sites. Now, they are also partnered with Jia Ho, a local Chinatown market to distribute gift cards to residents through organizations focused on emergency food assistance. “The priorities we identified were from CBOs that we surveyed to determine and prioritize those needs,” said Dong.
There were recurring themes from the community health needs assessment. “Certainly in the Asian communities these were compounded by the language access issues, and language barriers that they faced across those issues,” said Dong. “So things like unemployment and food access, it was compounded by the fact that things were not accessible in Vietnamese, Chinese, so the role of the CBOs are more important in bridging those gaps.”
As youths are particularly vulnerable during this time, they are a focus of the program as well. “A lot of the youth related opportunities have been cancelled or modified to something virtual,” said Dong. “The goal is now to make sure that “there’s still a learning opportunity for youth that is not just in front of a laptop or computer, because they do need that socialization, even if it’s at a safe social distance. We thought again, the emphasis is on obviously encouraging the funded nonprofits to hire youth within their communities.”
In the past few years, Tufts Medical Center has strived to provide for students, educating them about healthcare by shadowing and interning in a healthcare setting. Particularly in the Asian communities, it is important for bilingual youths to know that speaking more than one language is an asset, not a deficit, said Dong. For instance, in hospitals, there are departments seeking bilingual youth to help communicate with patients who do not speak English.
The grant is also going towards accommodating opportunities that have been modified into a virtual setting during the pandemic. “We’re assuming that everybody has the technology to just go virtual, but that’s not true,” said Dong. She added that not everyone has the same access to technology. Hence, in understanding and supporting the need for technology upgrades, nonprofit organizations like the Asian American Civic Association has submitted proposals in such long-term thinking.
“Our programs and partners are focusing on things like internet access, so that the clients can actually get online and do virtual learning, laptop, so they have technology to do it,” said Dong.
“It’s important in this modern era, that Covid-19 has kind of shed a light on; there are definitely things that are easier for some and not others, and I think technology will definitely help bridge that gap. So while not a focus of our grant, definitely something that we wanted to support.”
While these funds will go towards basic needs such as food and necessities to stay physically healthy from Covid-19, behavioral health is also an important aspect that Dong wishes to address. “We’re looking at health broadly, and what contributes to the health of a community,” she said. “It’s jobs; it’s having access to things, like technology and other things, and it’s about your emotional and physical wellness.”
She emphasized that the funds are critical in supporting the staff that are assisting the community members with Unemployment Insurance applications, and being able to provide culturally appropriate foods for families in need. It will also help CBOs acquire proper technology to continue to provide programs and services virtually.
“We’re trying to let people see how we’re supporting health initiatives that we do see, if very broadly,” Dong said.
Below is a comprehensive list of all organizations that received aid from this grant:
Asian American Civic Association
Asian American Resource Workshop
Asian Community Development Corporation
Asian Task Force Against Domestic Violence
Boston Asian Youth Essential Service
Boston Chinatown Neighborhood Center
Chinese Historical Society of New England
Chinese Progressive Association
Greater Boston Chinese Golden Age Center
Josiah Quincy School Association
Kwong Kow Chinese School
Ricesticks and Tea
Vietnamese American Initiative for Development
Wang YMCA of Chinatown

20200710,Animal shelters stay active during shutdown as foster care increases for pets without homes,"Cooper was having a hard time finding a home until the pandemic hit. Now he has been adopted. (Photo courtesy of Scituate Animal Shelter)
Many animal lovers in Massachusetts have provided foster care for pets to keep them company during the pandemic shutdown, and providing a temporary home for the orphaned pets. The foster program at Medfield Animal Shelter (MAS) has increased by about 10 percent, according to the shelter’s manager, Marlene Simmons. The same increase also occurred in the Scituate Animal Shelter (SAS). Maryann Regan, the executive director, said that they have less animals to take care of inside the shelter during the lockdown, after many animals were taken to foster homes. The animal surrender requests also decreased during the lockdown, she said.
Open visits to the public in animal shelters were put on hold in the state since the beginning of the lockdown. In the meantime, staff and volunteers at shelters continued working, and acted as a bridge, taking care of both pets and pet owners.
SAS rolled out programs focusing on community assistance during the coronavirus outbreak, helping pet owners get through this difficult time so they do not have to give up their pets due to the pandemic. “Our mission also states that we will help animals and the people who love them,” Regan said.
The Phone Pal Program is aimed at building connections with senior pet owners who are isolated at home. Volunteers at SAS check in with seniors on a weekly basis that signed up for the program beforehand or were taken in through community outreach. Volunteers have conversations with them, or offer help with grocery shopping or doing things online. “Some of them didn’t even need anything,” Regan said. “They just were a little lonely and needed a friendly voice, and people love to talk about their pets, of course, everyone does.”

A free pet food pantry was set up by SAS in the community since March. “24 hours a day, seven days a week, no questions asked, no matter where you’re from, no matter who you are,” Regan said of the pantry.
The program kicked off with food offered from the shelter, and donations from people keep the pantry stocked. “Some days it’s completely full, sometimes it’s completely empty, which to me is a good thing it means that the community is finding it very, very useful,” Regan said. “The second we asked for something, we get it, because the community is truly amazing. It truly restores my hope in humanity.”
The Animal Rescue League of Boston (ARL) promoted a program called Keep Pets S.A.F.E during the lockdown, which delivers pet food and other essential pet supplies to clients’ homes, according to Catherine Knapp, ARL Director of Animal Care and Operations.
“We were still here in the shelter, receiving animals in critical need and providing veterinary care, in addition to taking care of all the animals in the shelter, and sending as many as possible out to our large, caring network of foster homes,” she wrote in an email to Sampan.
As Massachusetts gradually reopens the economy, animal shelters are making adjustments following new protocols and guidelines updated by the state and local governments, in conjunction with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The adoption centers at ARL opened on June 2 by appointments only. The phone lines of reserving appointments started on May 28, and it has been extremely busy, according to Knapp. Since reopening, their available appointments have been fully booked and many animals were already sent to a home.
“We are lucky to have a large team of more than 700 very committed volunteers who are always willing to pitch in when necessary,” Knapp wrote.
Appointment-only adoption meetings are also conducted in MAS, and a maximum of two family members can attend the meeting, according to Simmons. At the same time, they start to slowly re-engage volunteers, making it possible to gradually take in more pets.
Nothing can be guaranteed when it comes to making plans, however, and Simmons said they will not be conducting open adoption hours anytime soon.
Besides closing open visits and setting appointment only meetings to practice social distancing, animal shelters are adapting and exploring new operation modes. Regan from SAS said they are developing a kind of new routine.
Traditionally, if pet owners needed help to put their pet up for adoption, but preferred not to send it to a shelter, then the shelter would help post the information on social media, but not be liable for it. However, during the stay-at-home order, if someone contacted SAS and needed to find their pet a new home, SAS accepted the animal into their system. They then promoted the animal on their platforms, and took care of things like medical care until finding the right adopter.
“It was like an exaggerated form of something we’ve done before,” Regan said. “We might actually proceed with that a little bit at some level in the future.”

20200710,Tufts Medical Center epidemiologist discusses Chinatown Covid-19 test results,"Low number of Asian residents tested is concerning and perplexing
Tufts Medical Center opened a Covid-19 screening clinic on March 31 at Chinatown’s Josiah Quincy Elementary School and has provided mobile testing at senior housing complexes in the neighborhood. The goal is to make testing readily accessible for people who live in the area code of 02111, especially Chinatown. It is one of the most densely populated neighborhoods in Boston, which makes it a high-risk area for a cluster outbreak of Covid-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.
Tufts Medical Center partnered with the city and Boston Public Schools to open the Covid-19 screening site at 885 Washington Street. The lab processing is conducted at the Tufts Medical Center and results are completed within two days.
After more than two months of testing, data collected at the site has revealed a much lower rate of participation by the Asian population, specifically residents of Chinatown.
The total number of registered patients from April 1 to June 16 tested for Covid-19 at the Josiah Quincy Elementary School totaled 7,242 people, with 953 registered as Asian (9.9 percent). The number of positive tests overall was 11.9 percent. The total number of patients with a contact address zip code of 02111 was 177 (9 percent); of those tested in that zip code, 65 patients registered as Asian (10.8 percent).
According to statisticalatlas.com, data gathered in September 2018 shows a total of 6,871 people living in the 02111 area code with Asians making up 52 percent of the population at 3,596.
With these numbers in mind, the number of Asians being tested for Covid-19 in the area code remains extremely low; specifically, how many Chinatown residents may have contracted the coronavirus is still a gray area, and one that concerns Doron and other infectious disease doctors.
“If you were to try to compare the percentage that tested positive, I worry that you may not have a good representative sample there,” Doron said during a phone interview. “We’ve made it incredibly accessible using the Josiah Quincy School, which is typically used by this neighborhood, and so that’s a lot of the Asian community. It would be a place that people know how to get to and feel comfortable going to.
“We don’t turn anybody away. We have long hours, weekdays and weekends. So I think we’ve done all we can to make testing accessible. Whether certain populations differ in their interests or willingness, is something that should be studied. Interest and willingness to go get tested. This talk of there being a stigma associated with testing, with positive tests – that could be a deterrent, for example. And that may be different in different populations, but I don’t know whether that is relevant in the Asian population.”
Early on, when the coronavirus had broken out in China in January, residents and business owners in Chinatown were exercising more vigilance, and the majority residents wore masks. In fact, when this reporter tried to enter a store in Chinatown in mid-February without wearing a mask, I was turned away.
During a discussion with a senior housing facility director in Chinatown, she said that the seniors living there have been very cautious during the pandemic, not leaving their rooms or building often, and always wearing masks when in the company of others. So could the more vigilant practice of wearing masks by residents of Chinatown, especially early on in the pandemic, be part of the reason for the low positive test results and lack of testing overall?
“In fact, they were wearing masks anyway when it began because that’s what they do during flu season, during respiratory virus season in the winter,” she said. “And, you know, there were questions raised early on about whether that (wearing masks) was scientifically based and ultimately the CDC (Centers for Disease Control) did come out with a statement that everybody should be doing that. And since then, there have been some studies that have shown that wearing a mask routinely can decrease the risk for that population if enough people do it, and so, you might wonder if communities that were doing that starting from an earlier time period might have seen lower rates of transmission.”
But with the low number of tests by Asians in Chinatown, the greatest concern is that there may be coronavirus deaths going undiagnosed or unreported. Doron said the hospital is not looking at that granularity in the hospital concerning who has died while in the hospital. She did say, though, that there were a lot of discussions early on, not about concerns that people were dying at home because of the virus, but regarding the fact that hospitals weren’t seeing the typical diagnosis usually seen in hospitals, such as heart attacks, appendicitis, and other prevalent health illnesses.
She said the governor’s office did some research analyzing death certificates and death data during the last few months and did not see an increase in the rate of people dying at home during the pandemic.
Doron said data analysis has been conducted in other parts of the world, particularly in areas where hospitals became overwhelmed and couldn’t accommodate all of the Covid-19 patients, and it revealed an increase in the rate of people dying at home.
“That’s not happening in Boston, so that’s good,” she said. “I don’t think that the Chinese population around Chinatown is not going to the hospital, not being tested, not being counted, and then dying at home.”
To clarify when somebody should be tested for the coronavirus, Doron said the CDC and Department of Public Health are not recommending that everybody be tested in the absence of symptoms. “It’s not that they shouldn’t,” she said, “it’s that if they were to say that, they would have to say how often. And then if they said that, they would have to make sure that there was really testing capacity. Testing capacity is improving, but we’re certainly not at a place, nor will we ever be, to test every member of the population of the United States every day. Imagine that number of tests you would need. And, so, what is the frequency of testing, and would you even operationalize that to get it to everybody that needs it.”
With that said, Doron stressed that everybody with symptoms should be tested. And she said maybe it’s possible that Chinatown residents have had no respiratory illness symptoms in the last two months – but maybe not.
She said one must ask the question: are people in Chinatown with mild respiratory symptoms staying at home, and remaining isolated while they wait to recover? “Is that okay? That’s probably okay if they didn’t transmit it to somebody else,” she said. “All it does is not give us the numbers that we need to do our modeling.”
But she reiterated that they want everybody that lives in the Chinatown neighborhood that has symptoms of the coronavirus to get tested, and follow health protocols.
“At the first sign of any respiratory symptom, while waiting for the test, they should isolate themselves from others,” she said. “And to answer the phone if the public health commission is calling because they may be calling to see if they’ve been in close contact with somebody who tested positive. If you were in close contact, the new protocol is that you get one test at some point during the quarantine period, but you still quarantine for 14 days. And then if you develop symptoms, you get tested again.”
Close contact is defined as spending at least 15 minutes within six feet of somebody who tested positive. Boston Public Health, she said, does contacting tracing if a report of a positive test comes back from a person in a neighborhood, which entails questions about who a person has contacted and where they have been during the entire period that they were communicable, which usually goes back two days prior to the onset of symptoms. They also compile all the names and phone numbers of people they were in contact with and then call those people.
Currently, there is a downturn in Covid-19 positive tests in the state, but there could be a surge in any given neighborhood at any time, and densely populated areas like Chinatown remain most vulnerable. So maintaining vigilant testing is a must in containing the virus in the long-term.
The Covid-19 test site at Josiah Quincy Elementary School will operate only until the children return to school, Doron said. The school also has to go through preparations for the returning students, and at that time, the site will be closed. No alternative site has been identified to replace it, she said.

20200710,The Greenway News,"Conservancy’s horticulture team and rangers hard at work
By Rachel Lake
Summer has arrived on The Greenway, the contemporary public park in the heart of Boston. Stretching 1.5 miles from Chinatown to the North End; The Greenway welcomes millions of visitors annually to gather, play, unwind, and explore. The Greenway Conservancy is the non-profit responsible for the management and care of The Greenway. While many Conservancy staff continue to work remotely, our Horticulture and Maintenance teams are hard at work in the park, as well as our two Greenway Rangers.
During these warm summer days; The Greenway is in full bloom in Chinatown. Rosa Virginiana, commonly known as Virginia Rose, is a deciduous shrub native to New England. It blooms fragrant pink flowers in June followed by showy rose hips that mature in August. These flowers and fruit attract bees and other native pollinators to The Greenway as part of the Conservancy’s Pollinator Ribbon. Despite the delicate flowers of this rose, it is sharp and guarded with thorns throughout the long branches.
In addition to this native species, there are hybrid landscape roses seen blooming throughout Chinatown on The Greenway. These include Scarlet Carpet Rose and Home Run Rose, a wonderful clear single red rose.
Along the Serpentine Path, the Conservancy’s bamboo renovation project has been completed and the transplanting and new plantings will be completed next week with the help of volunteers. These projects will improve sightlines for safety but also add more visual interest to the gardens.
Conservancy Zone Gardening Volunteers returned to the park on June 1 and Group Volunteer Projects began on June 17. In addition to their work along the Serpentine Path, Conservancy volunteers are working on burying new irrigation drip lines in Chinatown. During what have been high temperatures in Boston, these drip lines, as well as regular weeding and watering, keep our organic gardens happy and healthy.
In Chin Park, the Greenway PlayCubes are open for children with a supervising adult and Greenway Fountains across the park have been turned on, including the Chinatown Stream along the Serpentine Path. We have delayed the return of most of the movable tables and chairs to the park in an effort to stem the spread of Covid-19.
Nearby on Dewey Square, our Greenway Food Truck Program is on a limited schedule and the Boston Public Market at Dewey Square has returned for the season, once again bringing locally-sourced food to those who live or work downtown from local farmers and small businesses. Farmers market vendors are proud to accept SNAP/EBT and HIP for all eligible products.
Further along The Greenway, our Greenway Open Market returned on June 20 and will take place every Saturday and first and third Sundays of the month from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. The Greenway Carousel at the Tiffany & Co. Foundation Grove reopened on June 26 on a limited weekend schedule and will be open from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays. All Greenway programming features enhanced cleaning and physical distancing procedures to promote safety for our park visitors.
Rachel Lake is the Marketing and Community Affairs Manager at the Greenway Conservancy.

20200710,H1B visa ban forces international graduates to reconsider seeking employment in the US,"By Carey Lin
On June 22, President Trump announced a suspension of processes and issuing of H1B work visas. This ban prevents foreigners from seeking employment in the United States. This is a concern for many, but especially to recent graduates from universities in the United States.
As recent university graduates in the U.S., students have a choice to apply for an Optional Practical Training (OPT) visa to legally work in the country. Many students had left to return home by May due to the COVID-19 pandemic and decided to not use the extra time they have on their visas to stay in the U.S. Those who have stayed to make the most out of their education have a limited time of one-year to work for an employer. After one year, or three years for STEM degrees, the OPT expires and they will have to apply for an H1B visa to continue to legally work and stay in the U.S.
“It is a huge source of stress, and a huge hurdle international students have to get through,” said Sarina Santiago, 22. Originally from the Philippines, she graduated in May from Boston University and is currently on OPT. Santiago began work in June as a Junior Strategist at Cult Health in New York City and has one year until the visa expires. In order to stay and continue working here, she will have to apply for an H1B visa.
“Not only do you need to have a company to sponsor you, but you also need to apply and then be approved of your application by the government,” she said. “It’s a lottery. It’s just bad news one after the other. As an undergraduate, you have less chance to get H1B unlike grad students because they’re priority.”
Because of how difficult the H1B work visa is to obtain, there is a joke that has been passed around. “The running joke of getting married instead,” Santiago said. “Back then it was a joke, but now, it’s like having to take that offer seriously. I literally get stressed talking about it; I get stressed thinking about it.”
Knowing what is in store for them as international students, Santiago said she stopped using LinkedIn to apply for jobs and instead uses it as a networking tool.
Claire Yu also took a different approach when she applied for jobs. “I started relatively earlier than most people,” she said. “I started in July 2019 in the summer.” 
The 22-year old Yu also graduated from Boston University and has a degree in Economics. “I knew that applying online wasn’t going to be as effective. I just used LinkedIn and cold-emailed people. I was interning full-time during last summer, and after work I would cold-email people,” she said. Currently in Boston, Yu found a job and is scheduled to begin full-time at an auditing and assurance company PwC in August this year.
“I went to the myvisas.com website, to see a list of people who will sponsor, and I saw what kind of jobs were sponsoring,” she said. “I targeted the roles for which I know they would sponsor. H1B is really hard because it’s geared mostly towards finance and engineering people.”
Elizabeth Chou, 27, graduated with a Master’s degree from Boston University. Job hunting has not been easy for her, too. “The job has to align with your major,” she said. “Like if my major was Public Relations, I can’t get this visa with a data analytics [job] position. Many firms ask ‘will you need sponsorship now or in the future?’ when I fill the application. I think H1B makes it more difficult to find a job because companies are less likely to spend money to sponsor you.”
In light of recent racial tensions and protests in addition to the suspension of H1B visas, those on OPT are faced with the reality of being barred from staying in the U.S. after the year. To those beginning their careers, more options are being taken from them. This reporter also faces the same challenges. 
As a recent graduate from Boston University with a degree in both Film and Communications, it is not easy to find a job that aligns with one’s degree. Moreover, H1B sponsorship is more common in some industries and for some jobs than others.
“Yes, your citizenship is definitely hindering a lot of your job opportunities,” Santiago said. “Because, of course, the U.S. is trying to protect jobs for their own citizens.”
 For recent graduates with less experience, it is even more challenging to find a job as a foreigner amidst the pandemic and racial tensions in the U.S.
“Honestly, even before he suspended this process, I’d made my mind that I wouldn’t apply for H1B and stay in the United States,” said Chou. “I will just go back to Asia as my OPT expires. In general, Trump’s administration is not friendly to international students and employees at all.”
Yu believes the announcement is part of Trump’s election campaign. “Majority of Americans don’t know about H1B visas,” she said. “The H1B visa application window for 2020 has already closed. The[1]  majority of the visas are given to specific jobs and roles in engineering and finance. And the majority of people who are unemployed during this pandemic are people who cannot work from home.”
For this reason, suspending the H1B visa does not affect unemployment rates in the U.S. amidst the Covid-19 pandemic. “What he does to suspend the H1B visa does nothing to help the unemployed,” said Yu. “It’s all for the upcoming election because it doesn’t do anything.”
Throughout his presidency, Trump has repeatedly targeted immigrants in the country. “It’s going to be hard to dwell on this sad and discouraging news, and your motivation to find a job,” said Santiago. “We just have a lot of drive and motivation that a lot of Americans don’t have. They don’t get the hustle of international people. The fact that our citizenship is a barrier is such a huge waste of opportunity.”
Despite the challenges, some are hopeful that the current situation may change after the presidential elections in November. Santiago, Yu, and this reporter have decided to remain in the U.S. to use our OPT and see if the H1B visa ban is lifted while we are still in the country. However, Chou has decided to leave the U.S. once her OPT time expires. The pandemic has revealed the realities that many immigrants face upon entering the U.S.
“Like I said, Trump’s administration is not friendly to international students and employees,” Chu said. “Also, Trump has been very rude to the Chinese people. What he keeps saying about Chinese people makes some racists hate Chinese and Asians in general. Honestly, when you walk on the street, can you really tell this person is a Chinese, Chinese American, or Asian American? It doesn’t matter if I am a citizen or not, it doesn’t matter if I have a visa or not. What matters is my race and color. It makes me not comfortable with staying in the United States. I am afraid that the discrimination and separation will become more severe in this country.”

20200605,Taiwanese students weigh decision to return to the US amidst pandemic uncertainty,"By Carey Lin
As Massachusetts begins to slowly re-open, students and recent-graduates who fled home abroad must figure out whether they will be coming back to the United States. Even those without visa-related issues, returning to the states at this time poses many challenges that may not be worth the risk for them. 
“It’s a big decision definitely going back to the US where the situation is worse,” said Rebecca Lee, Boston University graduate who is currently home in Taiwan. Lee is pursuing a masters program of Human Nutrition and the Registered Dietitian Practicum this fall at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland. Before that, she will need to move out of her apartment in Boston this summer. “It depends on the situation in those cities and the reopening process and the consequences, and that’s something we’ll see in the coming weeks,” said Lee.
“I think one of the biggest challenge in my decision making is deciding if I want to be close to family or continue to work in a country that is honestly not very respectful to foreigners,” said Jessica Chen. She is completing her undergrad nursing degree at Northeastern.
This is also a source of stress for Caroline Tung, a Boston University student pursuing a graduate degree in Physical Therapy. There is a very big difference in the atmosphere and attitude towards the pandemic in the US and Taiwan. “I get that [in Boston] we’re now required to wear masks, but I still didn’t feel very safe. Yesterday going out, and I felt so normal. I didn’t feel like self conscious at all, I didn’t feel threatened,” said Tung. She also realized the importance of her own and her family’s health and safety. “It didn’t really struck me until Covid happened that if my health is compromised in any way, that is going to put a lot of stress on everyone around me. That is the last thing I want people to think, and so I definitely will take all the precautions I need to take if I do go back [to Boston].”
These concerns are weighed against their need to complete their coursework and begin their careers. Chen said, “The pandemic also caused a lot more stress in terms of nursing students since our clinical hours can only be met in person.” Since classes abruptly moved online last semester, Chen will need to make up her clinical training later. “I will have to work while I’m in school,” said Chen. For Tung, she has yet to find out how Boston University plans to proceed with her program. “The PT program was not listed as part of the grad programs that will return to campus in the coming fall,” said Tung. She is worried she will not be trained adequately in her profession, and is  frustrated about how this will impact her program and career timeline. “Physical Therapy requires a lot of in-person and intimate work with patients, and it’s not something you cannot just do and learn online.” 
For those returning for work or internships, they face similar concerns. Austin Hsu just graduated with a degree in Finance from Boston University. He has a job offer that was supposed to begin in August, but his current timeline is unknown due to the pandemic. “I was supposed to take two exams to be certified before I can begin working, and that was supposed to happen in June. But now, I don’t know,” said Hsu. “I feel stuck.”
Apollo Lo, another recent graduate from Boston University with a degree in Computer Engineering has also been trying to figure out the logistics of his internship. “My internship is expected to begin in June and I can work remotely but they said I still need to be in Boston,” said Lo. As of now, Lo is “90% sure” he will be coming back to Boston, as he is hopeful that this internship could help him begin his career. “I wish I can do well in the internship and get a return offer. If the school is going to be remote then I might go full time next semester,” said Lo. “Because everything is last minute now though, I’m probably going to make a decision based on stress.”
Some individuals are coping better than others at the moment. Vincent Huang, a Northeastern student who will need to return for his fifth and final year in his Business and Economics program, is optimistic that the US will have it under control by August. “But that might be because I’m in Taiwan where it’s been chill and not that many people have been talking about it,” Huang said. As he had already went through the frustrating process of figuring out his timeline earlier in April, he is not as worried about it as the others. “Last I heard, Northeastern will be opening campus in the Fall, so for me it’s not worth thinking about it right now as I complete military service,” said Huang. 
Despite his optimism, Huang still has his concerns. “One thing that I’m still worried about is if this is going to be a cycle. It’s going to die down, and things are going to open up and the whole pandemic [might] start again,” said Huang.
Regardless of these considerations, they will all have to return sometime in August to move out of their apartments. The situation in the coming weeks as the US transitions towards a “new normal” will determine whether they will come back to stay. Tung said, “It’s really just watching the situation, and I’m definitely worried about going back. Because in my opinion, I don’t think it’s going to get that much better. Even if it does, I wouldn’t feel safe back in Boston.”
While some are fearful of the pandemic in the US, others are looking forward to coming back. “I really wanna go back,” said Huang. As healthcare professional in training, Chen is looking forward to helping out upon returning to Boston. She said “I am honestly ready to go back and help out these nurses that have been working so hard to flatten the curve.”

20200522,Asian cuisine restaurants coping during Pandemic lockdown,"By Carey Lin
Since Massachusetts went into lockdown due to Covid-19, restaurants have been coping by continuing their takeout business with “no-contact deliveries”. Some restaurants are weathering the storm. Tora, a Japanese restaurant on Tyler Street in Chinatown is “doing okay” and busy with takeout orders, according Eric, a Tora part-time worker. “Weekends are still pretty busy for us,” he said.  
But those who rely heavily on the dine-in experience such as hot pot, are not as fortunate. 
Hot pot restaurant Shabu-Zen on 16 Tyler Street in Chinatown has closed their store temporarily since the lockdown, unable to deliver the same experience to customers’ homes. As such, they have not been doing well. “Some stores are having a much harder time staying afloat than others,” said Evelyn Chen, from Dolphin Bay at 72 Brighton Ave. “It’s much more difficult to pack some food-to-go.” 
Dolphin Bay in Allston, however, has been staying afloat despite being short-staffed. “A lot of our part-timers are college students in the area,” Chen said. “The majority of our staff are no longer in Boston, and so it’s now just our family running the business.”  
According to Chen, many restaurants in the area have been doing worse, and under the circumstances, Dolphin Bay is managing to stay afloat. They are still taking orders and having them delivered through the different delivery companies they have partnered with. 
To maintain social distancing regulations, they have blockaded their entrance with tables and all employees are required to wear masks and gloves. “We used to let them come to the counter, but we don’t do that anymore,” Chen said. “We always stay behind the counter when they come to get their takeout, and that’s more than six feet apart.” 
Another restaurant, Xiang’s Hunan Kitchen at 1032 Commonwealth Avenue has also applied the same safety measures. They have blockaded their entrance and only allow take-out pick-ups right by the door. “We’ve built quite a reputation and business has always been good to the point where there is often a line outside waiting to dine-in,” said “Mr. Chang”, who did not want to give his full name. Owner and manager of the restaurant, Chang, said that despite not earning the same revenue by relying on takeout only, they have managed to stay afloat. The PPE relief funds they have received have also definitely helped them pay their employees during this time. 
On May 18th, Governor Baker announced details regarding the first phase in reopening Massachusetts. According to the press release and mass.gov website, restaurants are expected to open in Phase Two, and until then will remain takeout and delivery only. However, details of Phase Two are unclear and the guidelines and policies for reopening restaurants have yet to be announced. Phase One began on May 18, and Phase Two is expected to begin at least three weeks later if Covid-19 cases have not increased drastically. 
Dolphin Bay may not open even after Phase Two begins. “We might even remain take-out only until the fall semester begins or when we have college students part-timing again,” Chen said. “Without the help, we would not be able to handle the work load of a dine-in service.” As a family business, the staff of Dolphin Bay will remain so until they can get the help they need. 
Chang said that despite the announcement to reopen the state, the details are not explicit. “We will remain the way we have until further notice,” he said. Mr. Chang is concerned about having to separate customers with a safe distance and find a solution that is safe for employees to interact with customers. As of now, Xiang’s Hunan Kitchen will remain take-out only until further notice. “As much as we will and would like to comply with Gov. Baker’s policies, […] it needs to be more clear so we can decide what to do,” said Mr. Chang.

20200508,"Graduating during a pandemic: International students face job uncertainty, travel restrictions and visa issues","By Carey Lin
While the government continuously postpones the end of the city’s lockdown, confidence in official reports and statements are on the decline. Government responses to the Covid-19 pandemic has brought upon pressing concerns and uncertainties that directly impact internationals who have come to the United States for school or work. 
As graduation day approaches, the impact of Covid-19 on college graduates transitioning into the next phase of their lives has made things especially difficult. Instead of beginning a new journey of post-graduate work, many are seeking refuge at home. While this is a logical response for most, it is a far more complex dilemma for international students.
Jack Fan, a 21-year-old student from China , just completed his undergraduate Computer Science degree from Northeastern University. He had planned to attend graduate school in the fall, but due to the pandemic, he may not be able to.
“The University of Virginia actually told me that I can defer if I can’t get my visa,” Fan said. “Or if I want to defer to start in the spring. They didn’t say the specifics. They said I could but said to also wait for further instructions if I don’t get my visa.” 
Currently, there is a suspension on visa processing, and Jack’s original plan to attend graduate school has been delayed. “My original plan was to go home after graduating in May and applying for the visa in the U.S. Embassy in Beijing,” Fan said. However, he is still in the U.S., and Jack said that he expects to return to China. “Maybe I can go back home after applying for the visa,” he said. “I’m optimistic that the embassy will open after June.” 
For international students who intend to find a job in the United States,  they must file for an “Optional Practical Training” (OPT) as an extension to their F-1 visa status, and receive an Employment Authorization Document (EAD) before they can begin to work in the U.S. They have 90 days to look for work, or will otherwise have to leave the country. Those who applied for OPT in February usually receive their card around this time of the year. 
Marilynne Cheng, 22, from Hong Kong, graduates from Boston University this month with a degree in Advertising.   As a second semester senior, she had been applying for jobs long before the pandemic began. “It was a struggle to find a job before the pandemic [as an international], but I was still hopeful,” she said. “And then everything changed.”
She had successfully landed some interviews, but in the end, the recruiters would prefer to hire someone they do not have to sponsor. “It was super annoying that I get on the second or third round interview and then after the mention of OPT they would just ghost me,” Cheng said.
Since the pandemic began in the U.S., Cheng has slowed down her job hunt. Her OPT application has been approved, however she has yet to receive her EAD card. Without it, she may not be able to re-enter the U.S. within the card’s valid date. As the pandemic worsens in the U.S. she fears the pandemic will not end in time for her to find a job in time before the 90-day period ends. For this reason, Cheng will be flying back to Hong Kong once her finals are over. “I’m just trying to think that I am already luckier than most,” she said. “On the bright side, everything could be way worse. The fact that I have the resources to go home is already privileged already.” 
Another recent graduate from Boston University, Claire Yu, 22, from Taiwan, also faces the dilemma of returning home. Yu already received her EAD card and has a job lined up in August. Since the pandemic began, Yu had planned to return to Taiwan late May to visit. “So I was initially thinking [to leave] late May, because I feel like COVID might have gone down by then a little from its peak, and quarantine might have let up a little,” she said. “But now because of my grandmother, I’m planning to leave right after finals end for me on the seventh, so I might leave on May 9.” 
However, as a result of Covid-19, international flight restrictions pose many difficulties logistically and financially. “When you fly back to Asia, it’s usually about 20 hours,” Yu said. “But now only [a couple] airlines fly, and it will take 45-plus hours to get home and transfer from Boston to Dallas, Dallas to Tokyo, and Tokyo to Taipei. I feel like this will expose me to a lot more risk of infection.” And it is not only a dangerous health risk flying now, but expensive too. “The cheapest ticket I can find is $1,200 two-way but the outbound flight will be 45-plus hours,”  she said. 
Claire’s friend, Roxanne Chang, has also been trying to go back to Taiwan. Despite being an American citizen, she grew up and lives in Taiwan. Deciding to go home was not a difficult choice, but doing so has been a challenge. “Even going home has been so hard,” she said. “My flight got cancelled like three times. I was supposed to fly out tomorrow, and then it got cancelled two days ago. So I have to fly out next week. It’s been awful, but I’m like super blessed because I have friends in Boston that I can stay with.”

20200417,Animal care services still available to Boston Community and remain vigilant during COVID-19 lockdown,"With the city on lockdown and increasingly strict social distancing regulations, people have either been depending on or seeking the company of a pet. Adoption is incredibly popular, as well as fostering pets during this time. The Animal Rescue League (ARL) Boston have put a hold on all new volunteer and foster parent orientation due to social distancing regulations and the sudden popularity of animal foster care. The uncertainty of these times make foster care a more appealing option to some, with the assumption that the current conditions are temporary. While such companionships have been increasingly in demand, many pets have also been left vulnerable under these circumstances. 
Since the Bronx Zoo Tiger in New York City has contracted the coronavirus, there have been increasing concerns about animals and pets contracting or carrying the virus. Animal care centers like the Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (MSPCA) have ensured their communities that they will remain open with adjusted hours. Smaller and lower cost vet appointments are limited and vets will only take urgent care cases. They are reachable through phone and email during their adjusted open hours.
Animal centers currently are not looking for new fostering applications and will only conduct their system through existing animal foster parents. Some organizations such as the Northeast Animal Shelter has closed to the public and will suspend adoption processes for the time being. MSPCA will be continuing their adoption program online while taking necessary precautions with the right equipment when transitioning animals into their new homes. Their other programs, such as pet trainings have been moved to virtual and online platforms. While ARL has suspended new volunteer trainings until May 1st, MSPCA’s transition online has no set deadline.
Unleashed, a branch of PetCo on Washington St. have also halted their dog training lessons until further notice. Manager Jess Lopes says “dog trainings are a main pillar of sales, so the store really took a hit from having to cancel classes.” Otherwise, business has pretty much remained the same. “There has definitely been a lot more online orders, but people still come in to the store everyday, buying stuff a bit at a time, like finding an excuse to leave their houses.” The most significant change is that people are buying pets to keep them company. Compared to the usual rate of one to two pets adopted a month, there were 7-10 adoptions made in the last two weeks alone. “Everyone has a puppy now. ‘Quarantine buddies,’ that’s what they’ve been calling them,” says Jess.
In a transient city like Boston, many college students debated on staying or leaving the city. Pet parents who were forced to travel home, scrambled to look for homes for their four-legged friend. Ece Yavuz, a college senior at Boston University, graciously offered to help take care of her friend’s dog Freddie. 
“I had a feeling I would have to take care of him at one point. I suggested it soon after she left for Istanbul, Turkey,” Ece shared.
Since she had roommates in her own apartment, she has been staying at her friend’s vacated apartment to take care of Freddie. “I still am adjusting to it,” she said. There were a few adjustments she’s had to make. They are good changes, she claims, “compared to before, I am living a more active life.” Since taking care of Freddie, she’s been taking social-distanced walks “to make sure the dog doesn’t feel too cooped up.” 
Ece also takes precaution after being out doors with Freddie. “Everyday before he enters the house after a walk, I wipe his paws and face and make sure he’s not bringing in the virus himself.” She also adds, “you never know, something may be transferrable to me.
Under these uncertain times, individuals, organizations and even the furry friends are coping in their own ways. Each animal shelter, care and adoption center have announced their dedication to the care and safety of the animals under the circumstances. Despite the different tactics, animal protection services remain vigilant during the COVID-19 pandemic.

20200403,Qingming Festival postponed due to outbreak of Covid-19," by Yiming Zhao 趙怡茗
Every year, days after the Spring equinox, many Chinese families would gather together to visit the tombs of their ancestors to clean the gravesites. Qingming Festival, also known as the tomb-sweeping day is the opportunity for many Chinese families to pay respect to their passed loved ones, burn joss paper and display tea, food, and flowers by the tombstones. Dating back to 636 BC, the holiday has long been an important part of Chinese culture and has been declared a national holiday in mainland China since 2008. Many Chinese families now living in the America also carry on the tradition.
However, due to the outbreak of Covid-19, the traditional gathering of family members at the cemetery will not be possible this year, following an emergency announcement by Mass. Gov. Charlie Baker that social gatherings of more than 25 people is prohibited.
In past years, Alan MacKinnon, president of The Gardens Cemetery, had put out tents, tables, chairs, and special burning barrel just for burning joss at locations where people usually meet during the festival.
“We try to provide comfort and hospitality for our families,” MacKinnon said. “This year is kind of hard and it makes me sad.”
There are still people planning to come to the cemetery during Qingming to pay respect, but it will only be six to eight immediate family members, according to MacKinnon. He said he would allow people to self-govern. “[If] they are close together, I won’t go up and say ‘hey you’re not six feet [apart].’ I’m not the Covid-19 police.”
The Gardens Cemetery has put out a health and safety guideline regarding the coronavirus on their website. All his employees will be issued four gloves daily, and they’re not allowed to share utility vehicles.
“I have a house here [at the cemetery],” said MacKinnon. “One [of my staff] is in my house, one person is in the front room, I’m in the backroom, and we don’t let anybody come to the office. We don’t have a public restroom at this time.”
Whenever there is a service, the staff will enter 10 minutes after everyone has left, and wipe everything with disinfectants while staying ten feet away from fellow staff members.
“We’re trying to be as safe as we can, so we can continue to serve our families,” said MacKinnon.
Lola Tom, the manager of Asian services at Hamel-Lydon Chapel & Cremation Service of Massachusetts expressed that Qingming will have to be delayed, but not canceled. The Hamel-Lydon chapel has been serving the Chinese and Vietnamese communities in Quincy since 1932. Tom is now working with clients to proceed with burials and cremations; however, she will be postponing the memorials for a later time.
“There’s definitely an impact in terms of traditional Chinese funerals,” Tom said. “It is a large gathering. It’s always [about] seeing that person one last time and bow three times out of respect. That’s not possible these days, but people have been really understanding.”

20200403,College life during the Covid-19 pandemic: Three Boston students’ stories,"Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker announced on March 23 a stay-at-home advisory for all non-essential businesses, which is expected to continue through the month of April to control the spread of the novel coronavirus. So all colleges in the state are required to close during this time.
Before the announcement, universities and higher education institutions in Boston had already taken measures, canceling in-person classes and switching to online classes for the spring semester. Students were sent home, saying goodbye to normal campus life.
But not all students could return home. They had to hunker down in their dorms. Small foreign groups left on empty campuses in a city shutdown. So how are they doing during this isolated time during the coronavirus pandemic? How are they getting along in their studies, socializing, and trying to adapt to an extremely new pattern of life? Sampan interviewed three university students from different backgrounds to get a sense of these students’ interrupted lives.
Life goes on despite drastic changes
In a post on her Wechat account, Xiaoyi Liu, who is from China, wrote, “Having been lying at home for six days, my lower body is deteriorating.” Liu is a sophomore at Boston University. Although the university stopped all in-person classes, and she goes on with her daily classes, but all at home.
Studying Linguistics and Computer Science with heavy a workload, learning from home has its good sides from Liu’s perspective. Liu now sleeps until 10 a.m., which was a luxury for a daily commuter. With Studies being the focus of her life, Liu usually starts her day checking lessons on the Blackboard, educational software B.U. students and professors use daily. With the extra free time, she gets more time to watch her favorite TV series on Netflix, sometimes until 2 p.m. She also started to exercise following Keep, a mobile exercise application popular in China. It is a new routine she follows to try and stay in good physical condition.
Live class is as real as a normal, in-person school class, although Liu attends class in her bed with a laptop on the table next to her bed. Students and professors see each other through the little window. Students can ask questions and communicate with the professor like they would in a classroom setting.
Being stuck at home, students are coming up with ideas to make life more interesting. Some of Liu’s classmates uploaded a picture as the background of a window. A student uploaded an image of Pikachu, a Japanese cartoon figure, and the student’s face is placed above the figure’s stomach. Another student chose a picture of an empty room, making the viewer feel like the person was at the classroom.
Online class has its flipsides. For example, Liu said sometimes it’s difficult for her to concentrate, and she can’t help but check her phone from time to time. Accordingly, she has to go back to the point that she missed after the class, which lowers her study efficiency. She also tends to lose track of time staying at home all day, sometimes causing her to be late for class.
Overall, Liu is content with her current life. Although her mother wants her to  return to China before the semester ends, she insists on staying in Boston, considering the convenience of taking class without time gaps and internet barriers, in addition to the inaccessibility of flight ticket going back China.
“My mother leaves me long paragraphs convincing me during my sleep, but she also respects my opinions,” Liu said.
As for the coronavirus, Liu thinks staying here is safe so long as she does not go out. Being cautious and dealing with the pandemic, Liu does not leave home except for picking up take-out food downstairs or going grocery shopping. She even decided to stop ordering take-out with her only roomie, who shares the apartment with her, under the fear of the potential virus at the take-out.
Adapting to a difficult situation
“It’s a tough situation, but I’m looking for the ways in which I can make myself happy, and I still feel like I’m achieving stuff,” said Daniel Pooley, who was born in Thailand from British parents, and a junior majoring in percussion at Boston Conservatory at Berklee. Currently, he is living with one of his three roommates in an apartment in Allston.
Unlike Liu, whose class schedule was not affected a lot by the current situation, some of Pooley’s classes were entirely changed in content, and he also lost some chances to practice. Staying at home means he does not have access to those large instruments at school, nor can he get hands-on guidance from professors. For example, his marimba ensemble class was turned into score study discussion, in which students learn and practice the basic principles of running an effective music ensemble rehearsal.
A decrease in the workload caused Pooley to come up with multiple ways to fill the time.
“They don’t take up anywhere near as much time in the day as my normal schoolwork was,” he said. So he has developed several side projects, utilizing resources he has and digging deeper into his personal interests. One of them is vibraphone, which he has with him. He printed out every piece of the score he could find the day before the school closed. Now he has time to play every single piece of them. He also teaches himself new music styles like jazz. And he is considering picking up bass guitar.
Pooley has days when there is no class. Staying at home all day, looking at his phone and doing nothing is another kind of routine. “I think that’s something that I’m battling right now,” he said.
Pooley’s family now lives in Seattle, where the pandemic is more serious. They keep in touch making sure everything is okay on both sides.
Returning to one’s home country
On March 19, Hashimoto Akira posted an announcement on his Facebook. He is a journalism graduate at Boston University from Japan. He wrote, “Due to this chaotic coronavirus situation, I decided to go back to Tokyo from Boston today. Dear all my friends in Boston and other places in the states, I am sorry I need to leave the country in this way. I will be back in this fall so please stay in touch by then through SNS or whatever way that can connect us…”
Akira lived on campus, and he still needs to pay for the rent even though he left ahead of time, and the monthly rent is $1,950 dollars. He made the decision despite of the economic loss. The reasons are multiple.
First of all, Akira thinks the situation of the coronavirus pandemic in Japan is slightly better than that in the U.S. “I feel like the wave of the coronavirus basically moved to the west from the east, while we still need to be so cautious, of course,” he said. Since all the spring classes are going to be held online, and he already planned on doing internship in Japan, there is no point staying in Boston anymore for him. In addition, he has a concern that Japan may restrict travelers from the U.S. in the future.
At the time of the interview, Akira was back in Japan for only four days and was still adapting to life back home. Jet lag is troublesome, and he tried to get on to the normal time schedule following the meals with his family, his parents and sister. The 13-hour time gap between the two countries affected his online classes. For example, he has a class beginning at 2:30 p.m. in Boston, which is 3:30 a.m. in Japan. He had to email the professor asking for alternatives take the class, and luckily, he was allowed to watch recordings of the class.
With the money loss and the inconvenience of online classes, Akira could still see the silver linings of the crisis. “I should appreciate something that I take for granted, so taking my dog Ashley is one of the things that kind of makes me think something like that.”

20200403,Boston’s housing market crisis could be exacerbated by Covid-19 shutdown,"As the country enters a recession that could devastate the economy, Boston’s housing market will likely be hard hit. (Photo by Shira Laucharoen)
The coronavirus outbreak led to more than 10 million people nationally filing for unemployment during the second week of filing in what will likely be a growing number as the country remains in shutdown.
While it has not yet officially been stated that the country is in the midst of an economic recession, we are essentially already there, said Devin Michelle Bunten, a professor at MIT’s Department of Urban Studies and Planning. The housing market is certain to be affected by this decline, as housing prices and rents in the city will fall, and the impact of the recession will be felt across industries.
“One of many wild things about this recession is that usually the decline in GDP is driven by interest rate sensitive sectors. That means that housing is at the top of the list, as well as commercial real estate and industrial production, things that people buy with loans.  That is not the case today,” said Bunten.  “Housing did not lead us into this recession, but it is definitely going to follow us.…Mortgage demand declining means that home purchase demand is declining, which means sellers are not going to be able to get what they thought they would.  It’s almost certain that we’re going to see some negative repercussions for housing prices.  There’s a huge amount of uncertainty about what that endgame looks like.”
Prior to the spread of the coronavirus, Boston was still experiencing a housing crisis, said Bunten. The state of Massachusetts has no rent control, and neighborhoods had been rapidly gentrifying, she said. According to the Greater Boston Housing Report Card of 2019, Metropolitan Boston is one of the most expensive places in the country to buy a home, ranking as the fourth most expensive of the 25 largest metropolitan areas in the United States. The area experiences “insufficient housing supply, lack of housing affordability, and inequity in access to housing,” reads the Report Card.  Ryan Boehm, spokesperson for the Executive Office of Housing and Economic Development, said that to keep up with demands in the market, Massachusetts needs more housing production, the lack of which has resulted in increased rents and home prices.
During the Great Recession of 2008, the nation saw a collapse of the value of housing and the mortgage industry, leading to dispossession, said Balakrishnan Rajagopal, a professor at MIT’s Department of Urban Studies and Planning.  While Boston’s housing market was not as severely hit as other states, a series of smaller enclaves were impacted, he said, particularly as marginalized communities and economically oppressed populations experienced foreclosures.
Executive director of the Asian Community Development Corporation, Angie Liou, said that this recession is unprecedented because of the short time that it took to hit the country.  Chinatown will be expected to feel the impact of a recession in its housing market right away, said Liou. Even though housing prices may come down as a result of the recession, sales and rentals will likely take a hit, as most people will be ill equipped to afford them.
“The backbone of the Chinatown economy is a lot of these small businesses, food, restaurants, bakeries, bubble tea shops,” Liou said. “We did an initial, quick survey among our residents, and not surprisingly, a big number of them were already experiencing loss of jobs or reduction of work hours.” She added, “That the immediate impact on housing is that people are worrying about how they’re going to make next month’s rent, because we don’t know when people can go back to work.”
Up until now, gentrification had continued to affect the neighborhood, said Liou, with Chinatown considered to be one of the most contested real estate markets in the city. Even before the recession, families had experienced the threat of displacement, mostly due to rent increases and difficulties with landlords, while developers had been changing the face of Chinatown.
According to the study “Forced from Home” produced by MIT’s Department of Urban Studies and the Chinese Progressive Association, close to half of residents in Chinatown spend more than 30 percent of their income on rent.  A report from the Chinatown Community Land Trust indicated that from 2013-2017, only 48 percent of residents in Chinatown were Asian.
In recent years, the presence of new, high-rise luxury buildings, unaffordable to working families traditionally living in Chinatown, has been felt. Meanwhile, the historic row houses, long valued by community members, have undergone a transition, with their original tenants being evicted to make way for higher end housing.
Addressing the problem of gentrification will need a different way of approaching housing in Chinatown, said Karen Chen, executive director of the Chinese Progressive Association. Housing should not be awarded to the highest bidder, but should respond to the demand of the community. Chen said the city has to work to protect the working class core of neighborhoods.
The gentrification of neighborhoods in cities has become a national and international phenomenon, she said. “Housing has been used as a profit-making tool, and we have to change the narrative around that. It should be a human right. We need to have some formal form of rent stabilization. Whatever rent we’re paying should be proportionate to people’s income. There should be more tenant protection. There should be more funding for affordable housing. We should have development, but focus on development without displacement. We shouldn’t rely on market study. Let’s rely on human need.”

20200320,Officials and community leaders speak out against discrimination of Asian-Americans during coronavirus outbreak,"With the development and expansion of the COVID-19 epidemic, hostility and attacks against the Asian American community have been increasingly reported, leading physical and spiritual harm to related residents and local business owners in the U.S. 
To dispel the spread of misinformation of the virus, condemn the verbal insults and attacks against Asian Americans across the country, the Massachusetts Asian American Commission organized a press conference at the State House steps on March 12. State and local officials, business leaders, and public health professionals attended and made speeches. 
Rachael Rollins is the District Attorney of Suffolk County, spoke, stating that she is addressing all individuals in Asian-American communities. 
“I’d like my face to be very clear, and when you hear me say this, listen closely,” she said. “If you are bigoted and hateful, if you are targeting people based on xenophobia or racism, you will be held accountable in Suffolk County.” 
Rollins encouraged victims of xenophobia attacks to call the district attorney’s office (617-619-4000). For parents, Rollins added, they are civilly responsible for their children’s misbehaviors. 
“I don’t think the virus sees color,” said Karen Chen, executive director of the Chinese Progressive Association. Not everyone has the privilege to get adequate protection and healthcare, Chen said, so that “we have to make sure that people around us also have the options that you have.”   
Elisa Choi is a physician who took a break from her work to speak at the event. “There’s also a lot of social media circulating that’s calling this virus the ‘China virus,’ she said. “That’s absolutely incorrect and unacceptable.” 
Choi said that most people who contacted COVID-19 virus may have a mild illness, but those who have the most vulnerability of having severe symptoms of the virus, are those who are elderly, who have chronic diseases, or who have immune-compromised conditions. 
“We all need to bind together as a community, irrespective of our race, ethnicity, nationality, and recognize that this is a trying time for all of us,” Choi said. 
Tackey Chan, representative for the Second Norfolk District, said that discrimination and misinformation, driven by social media, is a problem. On the other hand, people should make good use of the internet and keep track of the latest situation, combating fears and dispelling misinformation. “The more we know, the better off we are,” he said.

20200319,Chinatown to add more than 500 units of affordable housing,"Chinatown is one of Boston’s densest neighborhoods. With more than 50,000 residents per square-mile based on U.S. Census data — including high-rise developments around Boston Common — every inch of land downtown is precious.
However, Boston’s development boom has resulted in more affordable housing funds. Here’s a list of affordable housing projects to be implemented in Chinatown, adding up to 579 units.
288 Harrison Avenue

The current Tai Tung Village south parking lot is slated to become a six-story building with 85 affordable housing units and 40 parking spaces, said Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association (CCBA) executive director Susan Chu. Project plans are currently under review by the Boston Planning and Development Agency.
Tai Tung Village currently has 214 units in four buildings, completed in 1972 as a fully affordable housing complex. CCBA is developing the 288 Harrison Avenue project with Beacon Communities.
CCBA is a nonprofit organization established in 1923 to serve and unite the Chinese community, promote and preserve Chinese culture and traditions, assist in the provision of low income and other housing to the Chinese community, and serve as a coordinating body for Chinese community charitable and educational activities in Greater Boston.

290 Tremont Street
Another surface parking lot is slated to become homes. The mixed-use project at 290 Tremont Street will have up to 168 affordable home ownership and rental housing units, along with community space for the Chinatown library branch. The 350-foot-tall building comprises a hotel with up to 200 rooms and up to 340 parking spaces.

The BPDA has approved the project. The building is being developed by 288 Tremont Street Partners, a collaborative partnership of the Asian Community Development Corporation,  Corcoran  Jennison  Company, MPB Tremont (an affiliate of MP Boston) and Tufts Shared Services (TSS is a  joint  venture  between  Tufts  University  and  Tufts  Medical  Center). Community developer ACDC will build the affordable housings, while Corcoran Jennison owns the DoubleTree Hotel and the eventual hotel rooms. TSS will expand its parking lot, while MP Boston is directly responsible for 110 of the units through affordable housing linkage funds from its 115 Winthrop Square project.
Row house preservation
The Chinatown Community Land Trust acquired two row houses in 2019, which will become seven affordable units permanently.
78 Tyler Street
An empty building at 78 Tyler Street will become six affordable units. The Archdiocese of Boston has agreed to sell the former Maryknoll Sisters convent to the Chinese Economic Development Council (CEDC), said CEDC executive director Ed Chiang. Once the council obtains a loan, the sale of the four-story building is expected to go through in April.
50 Herald Street
The current G-Mart at 50 Herald Street, owned by CCBA, is designated for affordable housing. A planned development area (PDA) between the CCBA and its abutters the Davis Companies (TDC) and the Boston Chinese Evangelical Church will add up to 536 units of housing to a commercial block. The 536 units include 138 units of market-rate housing at 100 Shawmut Avenue developed by TDC; up to 313 affordable housing units will be at 50 Herald Street, with another 84 housing units at the church. CCBA has put out a request for proposals to developers for 50 Herald Street, Chu said.

20200319,City and state take emergency actions to contain coronavirus,"The usually bustling State House was very quiet as the public stayed away and most legislative offices operated with a “skeleton staff” as one legislator put it. (Photo by Ken Smith)
By Ken Smith
Sweeping measures were taken in the city of Boston and throughout the state to constrain the coronavirus (Covid-19), guided by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health (DPH) and the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
On March 10, Gov. Charlie Baker declared a state of emergency. What followed were a series of sweeping measures that have put the state in lockdown mode.
The governor announced a three-week suspension of all public and private schools in the Commonwealth, which began March 17 and will continue until Monday, April 6. Mayor Marty Walsh went a step further, announcing that all Boston public schools would be closed for six weeks, through April 27.
“Our administration is taking these rapid steps to protect the health and safety of our residents to mitigate the spread of Covid-19,” said Gov. Baker at one of several press conferences held in the last week. “We know that a lot of the measures we are putting into place, including mandatory school closures and prohibiting gatherings of 25 people or more, will cause disruption in people’s day to day lives. With the steps we are taking today, we can ensure residents can still access key state services while taking necessary precautions to limit the spread of Covid-19.”
Colleges heeded the recommendation of the Department of Higher Education and DPH, closing in-person classes, and shifting to remote teaching. Most on-campus housing units are empty of residents now, except those students who stayed because they could not safely return home.
The governor also issued an emergency order limiting gatherings to 25 individuals and prohibiting restaurants and bars from serving patrons food or drink, which began March 17 and will remain effective until April 6; however, restaurants are allowed to offer take-out food service.
Hospitals are no longer conducting non-essential elective procedures, and licensed pharmacies have begun creating and selling hand sanitizers over the counter.
The Registry of Motor Vehicles (RMV) will extend the renewal timeline of certain credentials to reduce the need for customers to visit an RMV center in-person. The MBTA and commuter rail are operating at a reduced schedule, and building projects in Boston have been halted.
For those who cannot work due to the impact of Covid-19, the governor filed emergency legislation that will allow new claims to be paid more quickly by waiving the one week waiting period for unemployment benefits.
The administration also announced economic support for small businesses with a $10 million loan fund to provide financial relief to those that have been affected by Covid-19.The $10 million Small Business Recovery Loan Fund will provide emergency capital up to $75,000 to Massachusetts-based businesses impacted with under 50 full and part-time employees, including nonprofits.
All sporting events have been cancelled for the foreseeable future, and the governor joined Mayor Walsh in filing legislation to push back the date of the Boston Marathon from April 20 to September 14, designating the rescheduled day a legal holiday.

20200319,"In the 1987 documentary ‘Who Killed Vincent Chin’, the racism behind a brutal murder of an Asian-American man still resonates today","The director of the film, Renee Tajima-Peña, couldn’t travel to Boston due to the Coronavirus outbreak, but Skyped in during the discussion. (Yiming Zhao/Sampan)
“Justice for my son,” said Vincent Chin’s mother Lily Chin in tears after the jury acquitted Ronald Ebens of civil right charges in federal court in Cincinnati. Ebens, one of the men who beat Vincent Chin to death with a baseball bat on the night of June 19, 1982, in Detroit, will not serve a day in jail. Her pain and struggle were emotionally captured in the1987 documentary “Who Killed Vincent Chin?” which was shown at the Boston Asian American Film Festival held March 8 at Emerson College’s Paramount Theater.
The showing was followed by a sneak-peek of the upcoming PBS docuseries “Asian Americans.” Lily Chin’s lawyer and activist Helen Zia joined the audience for a discussion after the screening and was moderated by Boston University Asian-American Studies professor Dr. Takeo Rivera. The director of the film, Renee Tajima-Peña, couldn’t travel to Boston due to the Coronavirus outbreak, but Skyped in during the discussion.
Chinese American engineer Vincent Chin was beaten to death with a baseball bat on the night of his bachelor party by Ronald Ebens and Michael Nitz, two auto workers recently laid off from Chrysler. They assumed Chin was of Japanese descent and blamed him for the booming auto industry in Japan that caused their unemployment. Ebens allegedly said “It’s because of you little motherf—–s that we’re out of work!”
The brutal murder of Chin outraged the Asian-American community around the country when the two perpetrators were only ordered to pay $3,000 and serve three years’ probation with no jail time after pleading guilty to manslaughter. The judge failed to call any witnesses to testify on Chin’s side of the story, and there was no prosecutor present.
Many took to the street to protest the unfair sentence, and it sparked a Pan-Asian American civil rights movement. A group of Asian Americans in Detroit, including lawyer and activist Helen Zia, founded American Citizens for Justice. ACJ’s campaign and protest finally brought Chin’s case to trial. Even though Ebens was sentenced to 25 years in prison, the case was overturned due to a legal technicality. Ebens was acquitted in the retrial.
The Vincent Chin movement still made inroads in the judicial system, providing victims with a stronger voice, and requiring a prosecutor be present at all times during the court proceedings, Zia said. The Chin movement was also important in the development of current hate crime laws and ensuring that immigrants are now covered by federal civil rights.
Zia pointed out that the movie is very significant today because of the growing anti-Asian hysteria resulting from the coronavirus, which started in Wuhan, China.
“It’s real clear to me where we are today is part of a continuum that’s been going on for quite some time,” said Zia. “We have not only this white supremacy White House that has been trumpeting; they’ve created an Office of Denaturalization. What’s happening today really resonates for me having lived through that in Detroit. It’s like watching a bad rerun of a terrible nightmare.”
Tajima added that in the past 30 years the presence of Asian Americans has grown, and so too has the privilege for some Asian Americans. However, the disparity within the community is also significant, she said.
“You got some Asian Americans who enjoy privilege economically and socially. Other Asian Americans who are still really left behind. It’s a real question: how do we move forward?” said Tajima.
Zia agreed with Tajima and went on to explain that Asian Americans have never been in control of their own representation. She believes that Asian Americans get manipulated because they don’t control the media. They are labeled by others as the “model minority.”
“There’re plenty of Asian Americans who say ‘What’s wrong being considered a model?’ But if you’re saying we’re the good minority, who are the bad minorities?” asked Zia
She expressed the need for more filmmakers and creators like Tajima so the Asian-American community can control its own voice, media and identity.
To learn more about the contributions, and challenges of Asian Americans, tune in to the new PBS docuseries “Asian Americans” which premieres May 11.

20200309,Foundation honors New England public art,"The New England Foundation for the Arts recognized Silvia López Chavez and Kate Gilbert with the Newell Flather Awards for Leadership in Public Art on March 5 at the Four Seasons Hotel. (Image courtesy of Anqi Zhang.)
“This is a very special evening and I’m thrilled to celebrate with all of you. NEFA acknowledges that the ground on which we are celebrating is the traditional lands of the Massachusetts.” said Ann Smith, New England Foundation for the Arts (NEFA) board chairwoman. “We honor their ancestors, past, present and future, and recognize their continued existence and contributions to our society.”
Smith delivered the theme of the cocktail reception “Celebration of Leadership,“ hosted by NEFA on March 5 at the Four Seasons Hotel. Artists, philanthropy leaders and staff from NEFA gathered to honor arts leaders Larry Simpson and Newell Flather, celebrate the launch of the New Work New England program and recognize the first recipients of the Newell Flather Award for Leadership in Public Art.
Simpson is senior vice president for academic affairs and provost at Berklee College of Music, and serves on the NEFA board of directors. During his tenure in Berklee, the college created partnerships with more than 40 institutions and organizations globally.
In Simpson’s acceptance speech, he described receiving NEFA’s honor as taking “a long drink of water in the struggle for lifting the arts and seeking social justice.” With the water, “tomorrow, we return to our tasks with renewed vigor, even more committed to lifting the arts and seeking social justice,” he said.
Flather was the other honoree of the evening. He has been a leader in the field of philanthropy for more than 40 years, and was instrumental in bringing the Fund for the Arts to the NEFA. He developed the idea for and co-founded GMA Foundations, a philanthropic services company.
One of Flather’s friends, painter Robert Freeman, recalled their reunion after first meeting 20 years ago. Flather recognized Freeman, who was unknown at the time, at an event, and their friendship has grown since. Flather went to Freeman’s first art exhibition and bought his work, for which he built an extension of his home to fit the large-scale painting.
“He represents the values we struggle to maintain during these dark days, the values of caring about others and enjoying beauty,” Freeman said of Flather. “He is a man of the highest principles, and his commitment to others is unsurpassed.”
The Newell Flather Leadership in Public Art Award welcomed its first two recipients – Silvia López Chavez, interdisciplinary artist and Kate Gilbert, curator and executive director of Now and There. The annual award will give each recipient a $5,000 of unrestricted funds to acknowledge an artist or curator whose leadership in public art has made an impact on the quality of life in Boston’s communities.
New Work New England is an opportunity for New England’s artists in dance, film, interdisciplinary work, media, music and other art forms. It will provide grants of $7,500 to $15,000 to support the creation and production of new work that has the potential to engage multiple New England communities. The first deadline is June 24.

20200305,Big Brothers Big Sisters of Eastern Massachusetts finds mentors for students,"Big Brothers Big Sisters of Eastern Massachusetts is a program that pairs students with adult mentors who offer them guidance. Mayor’s Office for Immigrant Advancement director Yusufi Vali (red tie) walks with a student from the Mario Umana Academy. (Image courtesy of BBBSEM.)
Middle school students and City Hall employees gathered around a table, sharing their hopes for the future, as inspired by a worksheet on Martin Luther King Jr.’s “I Have a Dream” speech. One student said that he wished to one day be a soccer player. Another aspired to become a chemical engineer and go to Massachusetts Institute of Technology. They had worked collaboratively with their mentors, adults with jobs at City Hall, to come up with their responses.
This activity was just one way that students spent time with their mentors on a Wednesday afternoon. Youth in the sixth and seventh grades came from the Mario Umana Academy to pass an hour visiting with the City Hall adults in their workplace, as part of a program called the Big Brothers Big Sisters of Eastern Massachusetts and Boston City Hall Workplace Mentoring Program. The program was launched as part of a larger mentoring movement created in 2014 by Mayor Marty Walsh in collaboration with the Mass Mentoring Partnership, giving children in Boston access to mentors. The initiative of BBBSEM that pairs students with City Hall employees is a new one, having begun this past January, and it will be running until the end of the school year, in June.
“Each child is in a one-to-one relationship with a caring, adult mentor. The goal of those relationships is to ignite the potential that exists in these kids already, to champion them, and to help them build social and emotional competencies that allow them to succeed in school, work and life,” said Wendy Foster, president and CEO of BBBSEM.
Students will work on different projects to build their relationships with their mentors, such as writing rap songs together or sharing stories from their lives, Foster said. At the same time, they will be learning about the work that their mentors do at City Hall, which will possibly inspire them to pursue careers in government one day.
Staff members interview students and adults to understand their personalities and goals, before they are paired together as matches. Foster said she had wanted to work with a school from East Boston, as a response to the need of the community.
Sixth grade student Kristalyz Feliciano said that working with her mentor, Courtney Ho, has been a supportive and positive experience for her. Together, they have talked about jobs, family dynamics and the games they play at home. The program is fun, she said, and has “a good energy to it.”
“They’re really welcoming and accepting here,” Feliciano said. “It’s nice to have somebody you can talk to and trust.”
Nancy Kwan, who works as a speechwriter for the mayor, said working with the student she mentors has reminded her of what it is like to be 12 again. Having a mentor who you can confide in can be a meaningful and valuable opportunity, she said.
“It’s having someone in your corner and being your cheerleader, if you’re lost and don’t know what to do next,” Kwan said. “Having someone there is huge.”

“We’re boosting confidence and helping folks get out of their houses,” said Lei, healthy aging coordinator at the Wang Y. “The program improves balance through exercises to build strength and prevent falls.”
Lei is fluent in Cantonese and Mandarin, helping participants who are Chinese American and conducting weekly health seminars. Healthy Habits is open to all older adults, requiring them to work out at least three hours of week with a variety of classes and individual exercise.
Quincy resident Mrs. Yuan could work out at the South Shore Y, but has been coming to the Wang Y since 2013. She came with her friend Mrs. Wong, also of Quincy, to work out with two other friends in Chinatown.

“I like to work out in the morning, then get lunch or coffee with my friends,” Yuan said. She and Mrs. Wong take the Red Line and transfer to the Orange Line to the Tufts Medical School stop next door to the Y, making the trip several times a week.
Positive social experiences are a benefit of Healthy Habits. “We have a large, robust and diverse senior population,” said Christy Benincasa, Healthy Living director. “I love coming in every morning and seeing people with their routines. It gives hope to others.”
Sharko stopped working out about two years ago, then felt she was losing her balance. She decided to join the Y to preserve her health and also takes classes at the University of Massachusetts, Boston.
“You’re supposed to keep your brain function to stay sharp and fit,” Sharko said. “You shouldn’t feel embarrassed if you’re older.”

The Chinatown Safety Committee met March 4 at the DoubleTree Hotel, with a police report on local crime for the past 30 days.
MBTA Police Sgt. Ben Carrasco warned about youth attacks in groups occurring over the past few months in Dorchester and Jamaica Plain. No attacks have taken place downtown, as he warned the public to be vigilant.
“They run into stores, grab as much stuff as they can, then run out,” Carrasco said. “A juvenile, 13, punched an old lady in the back of the head … Some are affiliated with different street gangs, they’re very disrespectful and violent.”
A man, 18, arrested Feb. 16 for graffiti in Chinatown, made a public apology. He was sentenced to 30 hours of community service and was in jail overnight, as he was arrested after midnight and unable to call someone to bail him out. The man is an art student from China attending high school in Braintree. He was picked up with a 17-year-old female, who was charged as a juvenile.
Boston Police Department District A-1 Sgt. Steve Moy said aggravated assaults and breaking and entering incidents were down for the year to date. Moy expressed appreciation to District A-1’s overnight shift officers, who made several arrests while patrolling.
Police officers charged an individual with possession of a Class B drug Feb. 14 at 2 a.m. on Knapp Street, after observing him in a doorway throwing a white rock-like substance believed to be crack cocaine, Moy said.
On Feb. 16, a victim reported his car’s back passenger window was broken and cash was taken, Moy said. The suspect left his smartphone in the car, resulting in his arrest.
Police officers were called to a verbal and physical altercation at a downtown hotel on Feb. 21, Moy said. A man invited a female friend back to his room, where an altercation took place. The woman left before officers arrived.
Officers stopped a car driving the wrong way down a one-way street, with the driver refusing to give his license and registration, Moy said. The owner of the vehicle then ran up to the officers, saying he was a delivery driver who left his car running and was the victim of a carjacking. The suspect was arrested for larceny.
A victim reported his car stolen, after leaving his car running on March 2, Moy said. Officers did not find a suspect or the victim’s vehicle.
Officers arrested three people for trespassing along with breaking and entering on Feb. 28, after observing a homeless man knocking the door at an abandoned property and being let in. Police are trying to find the building’s owner at Harrison Avenue extension, Moy said.
A commercial burglary took place Feb. 23, with officers arresting a suspect from surveillance footage, Moy said.
A woman stole Mucinex and chocolates Feb. 21 from the CVS on Washington Street, Moy said. In a separate incident, a suspect stole $300 worth of chocolates from CVS.
Officers arrested a man selling cashews he stole from the Ink Block CVS on Feb. 20 at the Chinatown Gate, Moy said. The suspect had an outstanding warrant from Dorchester District Court.
Two arrests were made Feb. 22 by the District A-1 Drug Control Unit on Boylston Street, Moy said.
District A-1 Police Capt. Ken Fong thanked community members for their condolences on the Feb. 6 passing on his father Lester Moy Fong. He urged community members to report unlicensed tour buses stopping on Harrison Avenue on 311, as bus licensing is not part of police enforcement.

20200305,When does my child need dental braces?,"Dr. Cheen Y. Loo of Tufts University’s School of Dental Medicine. (Image courtesy of Tufts University.)
By Dr. Cheen Y. Loo, Tufts University School of Dental Medicine professor of pediatric dentistry
When I was growing up, children in high school wore braces. Nowadays, we see braces on people of all ages: elementary-school children, teenagers and working adults. You may be wondering if your child needs braces, as well as when is the best time to start this treatment.
The first step is to establish a dental home for your child. The dental home is defined by the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry as “the ongoing relationship between the dentist and the patient, inclusive of all aspects of oral health care delivered in a comprehensive, continuously accessible, coordinated, and family-centered way.”  By having a dental home, you will have a pediatric dentist who will guide the oral healthcare decisions for your child.
All parents want a nice smile for their children. If you are concerned with the appearance of your child’s smile, talk to his or her dentist about the options available to correct the smile. Children can be evaluated as early as age one. Most orthodontic treatment occurs on children around age 13, but many children need assessment and care earlier in childhood if the problem would benefit from earlier treatment.
Your child is a good candidate for dental braces if they have healthy teeth, healthy gums and good teeth-cleaning habits. There are different types of bites that need braces. The three most common conditions that need dental braces are overbite, underbite and crowding.
Overbite is a condition in which the upper front teeth overlap the lower front teeth. A large overbite can cause unhealthy teeth wearing, concerns about appearance, and sometimes even jaw pain.
An underbite is a condition in which the lower teeth and jaw protrude in front of the upper teeth. An underbite usually needs to be corrected earlier than an overbite.
Finally, crowding is the lack of space for all the teeth to fit normally within the jaws. The teeth may be twisted or displaced and cause difficulty with cleaning the teeth appropriately. Other conditions that need treatment include missing teeth, extra teeth, cross bites and excessive space.
Can we prevent crooked teeth?
Malocclusion can be caused by an oral habit or early loss of a baby tooth. Young children may have oral habits such as thumb sucking. Prolonged thumb sucking can create crooked teeth or bite problems. If the habit continues beyond age 3 years, your child’s dentist should evaluate and address the thumb-sucking habit to reduce changes to the bite and the jaw.
Early loss of baby teeth can also cause malocclusion. It is important to keep baby teeth healthy because baby teeth provide the pathway for permanent teeth. We need to treat a cavity in a baby tooth so that the tooth stays until it falls out naturally. If the cavity is not treated, it can cause pain, damage permanent teeth or cause them to grow in crooked.
When your child’s first tooth appears, take your child for his or her first dental visit. Starting early is the key to a lifetime of good dental health.

The outbreak of Covid-19 has many people worried about dining out, especially in the Chinatown area. Business has suffered because of these public health concerns. To show support for local restaurants, the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in Boston hosted lunch Feb. 26 at the China Pearl in Boston with city officials and Chinese media outlets to send the message that it’s still safe to visit these local restaurants.
“We understand that the fear is there, but as a friend of the Chinatown community, we have to step up at this time. In Chinese, we call it ‘Huan Nan Jian Zhen Qing（患難見真情）’. I want to let the Chinatown community and Taiwanese community know that now is the time to spread correct information about coronavirus, instead of fear of the outbreak,” said TECO Director General Douglas Hsu.

20200302,Light installation at Chinatown park seeks public input,"Artist Yu-wen Wu sought public input for her light installation at the Chinatown Gate on Feb. 6 at the Pao Arts Center. (Image courtesy of Mandy Sun. )
Artist Yu-Wen Wu hosted a community listening session Feb. 6 at the Pao Arts Center on her upcoming light installation at Chin Park. Wu is a local artist who emigrated from Taiwan. Her artwork examines displacement, immigration and identity. Wu was selected by a jury of Chinatown community members to create a temporary light-based artwork at Chin Park on the Greenway. 
Wu will incorporate responses into artwork representative of Chinatown’s history, future and present community. She wants it to be engaging and relevant to its residents. Wu said she loves one-on-one sessions, in which she can hear the individual stories of each person. 
The interactive event featured a line of boards in English and Chinese, allowing participants to respond with sticky notes. Questions ranged from abstract ones about light to immigration. A map of Chinatown allowed attendees to mark their favorite or most comfortable spots.
Sheila Novak, Greenway project manager, said canvassing will be an “interesting process because we don’t know what people will say.” 
Lucas Cowen, Greenway curator, said Wu was brilliant. “She is really, really good at understanding needs — understanding ways to interpret the ideas of a collective. She has lots of trust in the community.” 
This is the first community-based Greenway project, the second being “The Year of the Dog” commissioned in February for the 2021 zodiac animal. Wu’s artwork will be installed early August 2020 and on display for three to six months.

20200226,"Boston officials advise immigrants to keep benefits, despite public charge rule","Public charge rule changes were discussed Feb. 24 at Boston City Hall. (Image courtesy of Anqi Zhang.)
The long-expected “public charge” rule change has stoked a wide range of discussion and objections from immigrants, community advocates, service providers, business owners, elected officials and concerned citizens.
To provide more information on the new policy, five representatives held a roundtable discussion Feb. 24 at Boston City Hall, hosted by the Boston Mayor’s Office for Immigrant Advancement.
“We can truly say this is a racist policy,” said Andrew Cohen, supervising attorney of Health Law Advocates.

“Public charge” refers to immigrants likely to live upon financial and material support from the government. Under the new policy, an applicant who is “more likely than not” to need public benefits someday may be denied admission to the United States or lawful permanent resident status. Those who have used a certain amount of the specified benefits over three years will almost certainly be denied permanent residency, known as a green card.
The most impacted groups are those who live in low-income working-class families and want to apply for green cards through family petitions; who may be spouses, children, parents or siblings of U.S. citizens. Specifically, families with income below 125 percent of the federal poverty level (currently $32,750 for a family of 4 in 2020) would be hit; Income above 250 percent of the FPL ($65,500 for a family of 4) would weigh favorably.
The new policy also applies to short-term visa applicants, including business travelers, international students, and temporary workers traveling from abroad. They will have to go through extra paperwork with multi-layer questions during the application process, to examine if they may be ‘public charge’ someday in the future.
‘Boston is truly a welcoming city for all’
The rule is about penalizing poverty, and poverty aligns with racial disparities, Cohen said. In the end, the new policy is penalizing people of color, primarily people from countries where the gross domestic product is lower.

Marion Davis, director of communications from the Massachusetts Immigrant & Refugee Advocacy Coalition, said the current administration just wants immigrants who are highly educated, rich and ready to be successful from day one.
“We know the history of this country is people coming here, so many times with nothing, and then building their lives here,” Davis said.
By passing the public charge rule, the federal government is building a wall with restrictions and regulations that challenges the immigrant community. However, that does not represent Boston’s standpoint, said Marty Martinez, Chief of the Mayor’s Office for Health and Human Services.
“The mayor has been committed to the City of Boston to make sure people know everyone counts in this community, that immigrants are the backbone of the City of Boston and have been for generations,” Martinez said. “We will continue to work with them. We will continue to ensure that they have services and resources to thrive in our community.”
Vast majority of immigrants should stay on benefits
Since the new rule targets those who are not able to support themselves and live on multiple benefit programs, fear and confusion have roiled immigrant communities. Some believe they need to disenroll from public benefit programs they or their children are entitled to.
“We don’t want to promote more fear in the community. And that’s really an important message that we have,” said Mario Paredes, staff attorney at Massachusetts Law Reform Institute.
Panelists stressed the vast majority of immigrants in Massachusetts should stay enrolled in benefit programs, because they are not affected by the new rule.
“The people who are applying for green cards are not going to qualify for the benefits that really count,” Cohen explained. “And (for) the people who already have the green cards for more than five years, who may qualify for federal Medicaid, it’s not going to apply to them, because they’re exempt anyway.”
The new rule also does not apply to the benefits received by other family members, Paredes added.
Benefits not considered as “public charge” include Women, Infants and Children nutrition funding; Medicaid for people under 21 and pregnant women, along with 60 days postpartum; and the Children’s Health Insurance Program. Detailed benefits are here.
Furthermore, the whole policy is not about benefits. It’s about checking factors like age, employment status, income level, health condition, English skill and reducing family-based applications, said María González Albuixech, communications and immigrant health director at Health Care for All.
“The implementation of the rule is after tonight at midnight, which means benefits used before today, and application submitted before today are not subject to the new public charge,” Albuixech added.
Talk to professionals if you have any concerns
The new immigration policy is so complicated that it is overwhelming for the public to take in. Panelists strongly recommended concerned citizens should make use of community resources, reach out to related agencies and talk to immigration attorneys.
Mahsa Khanbabai, New England Chapter chairwoman at American Immigration Lawyers Association, spoke at the discussion. (Image courtesy of MIRA Coalition.)
“I think the key issue is to think about this in the future,” Mahsa Khanbabai, New England Chapter chairwoman at American Immigration Lawyers Association said.
Khanbabai suggested for individuals planning to apply for green cards should not start the application until advisers think they are well prepared.
The good news is applicants have more time to prepare, and attorneys could help minimize negative factors in their backgrounds, Khanbabai said.
Khanbabai gave some examples. People who are weak in English could plan to improve their English from now on; they could try to get credit scores higher; or consider if you have ever filed tax returns if worked in the state.

A birthday reception in honor of Japanese Emperor Naruhito took place Feb. 20 at the Federal Reserve Plaza. The celebration was hosted by Consul General of Japan Setsuo Ohmori and his wife Emi Ohmori.
“Emperor Naruhito is leading the Japanese people into a new period of time filled with national harmony,” Setsuo Ohmori said.
The emperor is an accomplished viola player and avid mountain climber, Ohmori said. Empress Masako came with her family to Boston, attending Belmont High School. The empress studied economics at Harvard University/Radcliffe College.
Japan Society chairman William Hunt said, “I’d like to propose a toast to his Majesty the Emperor: Congratulations to your continued success, prosperity and health. Kan pai!”
The event featured live music from jazz trumpeter Tiger Okoshi, sake tasting and a video of Emperor Naruhito’s May 1, 2019 coronation. Rugby player Kensuke Hatakeyama of the New England Free Jacks was introduced as the team’s first Japanese player, after being signed in 2019.
In 1959, the Japanese city of Kyoto became Boston’s first sister city, celebrating 60 years in 2019. The Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the prefecture of Hokkaido will mark 30 years as sister states this year.
The embassy will host Japan Festival from April 25 to May 26 at the Boston Common.
Emperor Naruhito’s birthday is on Feb. 23, when he will turn 60. He succeeds his father Emperor Akihito, 86, who abdicated the throne to his son.

20200220,Playwrights Kit Yan and Melissa Li share six decades of stories of Boston’s Chinatown,"Kit Yan and Melissa Li performed songs from their pop-rock musical “Interstate” Feb. 5 at the Pao Arts Center. The two are developing a work on Boston’s Chinatown as a collaboration between Company One Theatre and the Pao Arts Center. (Image courtesy of Ling-Mei Wong.)
A multigenerational multicultural group of community citizens gathered Feb. 5 at the Pao Arts Center. Some arrived hungry, but after good food, music and company, many left with their tummies and hearts full.
They gathered to celebrate playwrights Kit Yan and Melissa Li, PlayLab Pao fellows of a collaboration between Company One Theatre (C1) and the Pao Arts Center. The two-year community-centered art-making initiative will “create a new theatrical work with and for Chinatown residents to uplift the narratives and concerns of the Chinatown community.” Yan and Li have strong ties to Boston’s Chinatown. They are currently based in New York; Li was raised in Boston, while Yan grew up in Hawaii.
The pair were introduced by C1’s director of new work Ilana Brownstein and Pao Arts Center’s director Cynthia Woo. Yan and Li performed musical selections from their award-winning pop-rock musical “Interstate.”
Audience members reflected in small groups on individual connections to Boston’s Chinatown, and then shared ideas about creating a collective narrative. Yan and Li emphasized the creative process was iterative and collaborative. The content and form the theatrical work might take would be determined over the next year, such as being musical theater or play with music, along with languages it would be presented in.
Company One Theatre director of new work Ilana Brownstein and Pao Arts Center’s director Cynthia Woo spoke about their partnership. (Image courtesy of Ling-Mei Wong.)
In the airy, aesthetically lovely Pao Arts Center with about 60 other community members, I wondered how many knew we sat on a historically significant piece of land. In the 1960s, hundreds of Chinatown residents were displaced to make way for a highway. Did they know without activists leading the charge in reclaiming this land, negotiating with policymakers and developers, demanding affordable housing and advocating for community spaces, Chinatown might have lost important parts of its history, culture and soul?
Information about Chinatown history will be critical to project success, along with local presence. I was reassured to learn a community producer was built into the project, led by Christina Chan, local playwright and cofounder of the Asian American Playwright Collective.
Chan said she will help Li and Yan connect with Boston’s Chinatown, finding news articles about its struggles, strength and survival, and sharing social connections. She will organize face-to-face talks with residents and community leaders, and host town hall meetings so the fellows can hear Chinatown stories. The three will also brainstorm ideas about the play. Their creative collaboration will serve the project well, as it offers the lens of individuals with lived experience across six decades of Boston’s Chinatown.

20200220,"Boston officials provide coronavirus updates, emphasize low risk to Chinatown residents","A coronavirus community meeting took place Feb. 7 at the Josiah Quincy Elementary School. (From left) An attendee, Boston Public Health Commission medical director Dr. Jennifer Lo, Boston Chief of Health and Human Service, Marty Martinez and District 2 Councilor Ed Flynn answered questions. (Image courtesy of Ivy Huang.)
Boston officials held a community meeting Feb. 7 with residents about the coronavirus or COVID-2019 in Chinatown at the Josiah Quincy Elementary School. Dozens of residents asked about risk and were given tips to prevent infection.
Dr. Jennifer Lo, Boston Public Health Commission medical director, spoke about the first confirmed case in Massachusetts, a UMass Boston student in his 20s returning from Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the outbreak. His case is the eighth case of COVID-19 infection in the United States, with a total of 15 cases nationwide.
Boston Public Health Commission medical director Dr. Jennifer Lo. (Image courtesy of Ivy Huang.)
“The risk to the public from the virus remains low in Massachusetts,” Lo said.
The man sought medical care after his return to Massachusetts. He has been quarantined since and will continue to remain isolated until cleared by public health officials. His contacts have been identified and are being monitored for any sign of symptoms.
A resident was concerned a couple in his senior housing complex had been on the same flight with the young man confirmed to have the virus. Lo said all individuals aboard the plane are being monitored.
“The COVID-2019 virus is characterized by fever and respiratory difficulties, much like the flu,” Lo said. “And I want you to know that the number of people who are infected with influenza far outweighs the number of coronaviruses.”
Lo urged residents to get their flu shots. If individuals have a fever, cough, or difficulty breathing, or have traveled to China in the past 14 days,  or have come close contact with someone who has tested positive for coronavirus, to avoid contact with anyone else. The Boston Public Health Commission asks the public to contact your health insurance provider immediately.
Boston District 2 City Councilor Ed Flynn said he and his staff would ensure adequate and

comprehensive Chinese services were available to residents. His staff include Cantonese and Mandarin speakers.
“Every day in this country we witness and experience acts of racial discrimination, especially against Chinese [people],” Flynn said. “Here in Boston, we treat everyone with respect and dignity. The most important thing is that in this special period, we should have understanding and care for everyone.”
Nick Duncan, Tufts Medical Center director of emergency management, said “We have enough masks in our hospital and will dispatch them to community and patients if the time should arise.”
An attendee was concerned about the shortage of masks, as his/her parents have multiple hospital appointments. Duncan said Tufts MC would provide masks at its reception desk.
A student said s/he felt discriminated against for wearing a mask on the subway. Another attendee said s/he felt unsafe commuting from Cambridge to downtown Boston on crowded subway trains.
Tufts Medical Center director of emergency management Nick Duncan said the community hospital was prepared. (Image courtesy of Ivy Huang.)
The Centers for Disease and Control does not recommend to use masks to help prevent this virus, Lo said. The CDC recommends people use standard precautions to help prevent the spread of respiratory diseases. Wash your hands often with soapy and water. If you sneeze or cough, cover it with your hands.
Lo noted the coronavirus was a respiratory virus and not an airborne virus, meaning it does not exist in the air. Human-to-human transmission occurs when a person infected with the virus coughs or sneezes, and if another person is within six feet or closer, there is a chance of infection. Viruses will not survive on any surface, making it similar to the flu.
There is currently no vaccine to prevent COVID-19 infection, Lo said. The best way to prevent it is to avoid exposure to it. Frequently disinfect objects. If you feel sick, stay at home.

After the presentation, participants asked several questions below:
About information disclosure
Q: there are many rumors and panics in Chinatown recently. This meeting is very important. I live in an apartment for the elderly, there are more than 150 households, most of which are old and sick. Health authorities should take measures to keep residents in all communities informed of the latest news. A community meeting should be held to inform the apartment manager and the community manager to attend the meeting. As far as I know, an elderly couple in a room near me was on the same plane as the first patient in Boston.
A:All aboard the plane with the first young man in Boston to fall ill are being monitored and quarantined at the Boston center for disease control.
Q: If you go to China and then travel to other countries and come back to Boston, how do you know?
A:The immigration office will have information on whether he has been to China.
Q: how many people are currently in quarantine?
A: it involves personal privacy and cannot be disclosed.
About self-protection
Q: Can a flu shot prevent 2019?
A: You can’t avoid infection. The number of flu infections is much higher than 2019, so if you haven’t had a flu shot, it’s recommended you get one.
Q: I live in Cambridge. I need to take the subway every day. It is crowded every day.
A: If you see someone sneezing or coughing, the easiest way is to cover your nose and mouth. All the people who came back from China, we are now asking them to isolate themselves. Anyone who feels unwell should seek treatment at a medical institution as soon as possible.
Q: what’s the difference between the 2019 virus and MERS?
A: MERS, SARS and 2019 are the same family. We are also concerned because MERS and SARS have taken many lives. The death rate for MERS was 30 percent and for SARS 10 percent, a low figure for 2019 compared with 1 percent for the flu.
About rumors
Q: how do we identify rumors circulating in society? For example, it is said that the first case in Boston went to liu yi shou hotpot restaurant for dinner. How do we get the right information and reduce our panic?
A: So why are we calling this meeting? We’ll be Posting updates on our website and social media. We will also clarify the rumors on our website, hoping to be of help to the public.
If you have any questions, you can call the mayor’s office at 311.
Q: For the old people, they do not know or little access to the Internet, how to get information?
A: You can print a leaflet and give it to them, or you can tell us where you need it and we can provide the information to them. The Congressman’s office will also distribute 2019 virus fact sheets to communities and senior citizens’ apartments.
About the shortage of masks
Q: My parents often have to go to the hospital, and now masks are not available on the market. How can you solve this problem?
A: At the reception desk of Tuft Medical Center, you can get a mask. Not only one hospital, other hospitals will have enough masks to provide.
About self-isolation
Q: Do people from China have 14 days of self-quarantine?
A: Currently, all people from China are required to enter at 11 designated airports. Boston airport is not one of the 11 airports, so no Chinese passengers will enter Boston directly. All Chinese arriving at the 11 airports will pass a medical check at the airport and will only be allowed through if there is no problem.
Q: If people come back from China and they don’t get sick, will they be self-quarantined for 14 days?
A: All people coming back from China, if they don’t get sick, send the list to their local centers for disease control and prevention, and tell them to monitor them for self-quarantine.
Q: How are people coming back from China separated from their families? For example, if the wife comes back from China, the husband needs to go to work.
A: people coming back from China need to have separate Spaces and toilets. We can provide isolation if necessary.
About discrimination
Q: I am a student. I wear a mask when I go to school on the subway every day. What advice does the government have and how to protect those affected?
A: I know how you feel. You shouldn’t have this experience. Now we are affected by a lot of rumors, the mayor and the councilman will use various ways to promote the right way to deal with it, hoping to avoid these embarrassments. The young receive more news than the old. The attitude of other people should be aware of their own prejudice and discrimination. The culture of wearing masks in Asia is different from that in the west. Asians don’t have to be sick to wear masks.
About the economic impact
Q: Due to the suspension of flights to China, many people will lose refund fees on their tickets, which will have a great impact on low-income people.
A: Call the Boston immigration office or call the mayor’s hotline 311.
For more information, call the Mayor’s hotline 311.

El Jefe’s Taqueria will open in March at 80 Boylston Street, the Little Building of Emerson College, said founder and co-owner John Schall. He is applying for a common victualler license to serve food and will not apply for a beer and wine license.
“Everything is made fresh in our kitchen,” Schall said. “It’s all from authentic Mexican recipes from our chef.”
This is the third location to open, with taquerias in Harvard Yard and Bethlehem, Penn. Schall selected areas around universities to offer college students late-night food options. The Boston location’s planned hours are 8 a.m. to 2 a.m. Monday to Sunday, pending licensing board approval.
Schall is also the founder of Fire + Ice, with locations in Massachusetts and California.

Over walnut shrimp and crab rangoon, Boston Mayor Marty Walsh enjoyed lunch Feb. 18 in Chinatown at Jade Garden. The visit highlighted his commitment to local businesses in Chinatown, which have undergone a steep drop in business since the Covid-19 outbreak.
“We want to make sure we support our businesses here in Chinatown,” Walsh said. “This is their bread and butter. They are losing business, they will have to shut their doors and can’t afford that.”
Jade Garden general manager Peter Cao said, “It’s been really hard for our employees. … It’s great to have support from the mayor. It means a lot to Chinatown.””
Walsh began his Chinatown tour at Jade Garden, before stopping for bao at Great Taste Bakery & Restaurant. He sampled egg puffs at the Avana food court, before making his last stop at Asian Garden.
The mayor’s entourage included Chinatown liaison Lisa Hy, Mayor’s Office for Immigrant Advancement director Yusufi Vali, Boston Police Department Area A-1 Captain Kenneth Fong, Tufts Medical Center president and CEO Dr. Mike Apkon, Health and Human Services chief Marty Martinez, Inspectional Services Department commissioner Dion Irish, Fair Housing and Equity department engagement specialist Courtney Ho and Tufts MC director of community health improvement programs Sherry Dong.

20200214,Chinatown Coalition discusses substance abuse,"Boston City Councilor at-large Annissa Essaibi George addressed public health concerns at the Chinatown Coalition meeting Feb. 13 at Boston Chinatown Neighborhood Center. (Image courtesy of Yiming Zhao.)
The Chinatown Coalition met Feb. 13 at Boston Chinatown Neighborhood Center to discuss smoking and vaping in Chinatown.
Sherry Dong of Tufts Medical Center explained heart disease and lung cancer are connected to tobacco use. Access to mental health counseling and behavioral help is essential to people trying to quit smoking and vaping.
Edgar Elmudesi from Health Resources in Action gave a comprehensive presentation on the teenage vaping epidemic. Elmudesi said tobacco companies target young people, especially people of color, with ad campaigns and deceiving products. He showed vaping products shaped like USB drives or correction tape that pass as school supplies for teenagers. What also drew teenagers to vaping are flavored tobacco. There are more than 8,000 flavors currently on the market. Many are sweet and teens won’t get the same nauseous feeling from smoking combustion cigarettes. Elmudesi passed around different flavored nicotine “drops” for attendees to smell. He warned despite vaping products smelling like candy, they all contain nicotine and other dangerous chemicals. The nicotine makes them highly addictive.
Boston City Councilor at-large Annissa Essaibi-George attended the meeting. She plans to bring more family-sized affordable housing projects to Boston in the new year and have at least one nurse in every Boston public school. She also expressed concern over a sudden increase of HIV cases and more needles around the city.
“The City last year collected 700,000 needles,” Essaibi-George said. “But two years before that, we only collected 300,000. That’s because the drugs have changed. As the opioid crisis gets bigger, we’re starting to see some shift in drug use patterns. Every drug on the street right now is laced with fentanyl. The behavior of someone dealing with methamphetamine addiction is very different from someone dealing with heroin. Those behaviors are creating more street and sexual violence. We need to make sure our first responders are trained to respond properly.”

For the first time, the Quincy Dragons and New England Blazers tied in the wheelchair basketball game held on Feb. 14 at Josiah Quincy Elementary School. This Valentine’s Day marked the school’s fifth annual wheelchair basketball game with the New England Blazers and the Rollin’ Celtics. Students from the Carter School came to the game and cheered for the players. The Carter School serves grades six-to-12 school for students with cognitive delay, physical handicaps and complex medical conditions.
“Many of our students are wheelchair-bound,” said Josiah Quincy Elementary School Principal Cynthia Soo Hoo. “When we learned about the wheelchair basketball league they had, we were very interested in having them come here. Having them come here allows our students to see that it doesn’t matter your disabilities, it matters that you could still make things happen.”
Principal Soo Hoo played in the game and successfully scored two points for the Quincy Dragons. She said not having the use of her legs when playing was humbling. The game gave her a greater appreciation for people who are wheelchair-bound and she wishes to keep the game has an honored tradition for the school.
About 12 teachers and staff participated in the game this year. Physical education teacher Tom Levett organized the first game back in 2016. He wanted to make students using wheelchairs feel like part of the community. The Quincy school, completed in 1976, is one of the wheelchair-accessible buildings for the Boston Public Schools district.
The Boston Public School Wellness Department also attended the game. The department plans to bring the game to more public schools in Boston.

20200207,Chinatown Residents Association discusses potential digital billboard project,"Representatives from Media Vision spoke about a potential digital billboard project. (Image courtesy of Yiming Zhao)
The Chinatown Residents Association discussed potential digital billboards, Friendship BBQ’s proposed extended hours and the coronavirus situation at its monthly meeting on Feb. 5 at the Josiah Quincy Elementary School.
Representatives from Media Vision presented a proposal for a 15’ by 25’ digital billboard at the corner of Harrison Avenue and Beach Street. The proposal was opposed by the residents at the meeting.
Local resident Ryan Powers said it’s against zoning law to install any billboard in the neighborhood except for conditional uses.
“You put a cancer like that billboard in this neighborhood, it’s going to spread to all the other neighborhoods. There’s no place for those billboards. There shouldn’t be any more,” said Powers.
Paul Chan also expressed concern over pedestrian safety issues the billboard could potentially bring.
“It’s [located at] a very busy Chinatown center. People are prone to accidents in that location. I don’t care about community benefits. People will be getting run over by cars,” said Chan.
Jason Chou who worked in digital advertising added his worry about negative advertisement.
“There’s always a possibility of negative ads coming through. Imagine something containing sexual content that you don’t want your kids to see but you live right across the street from the billboard. You’re exposed to it 24/7. It’s totally unfair for the kids,” said Chou.
Residents from 49 Beach Street, the building that faces the board had already signed a petition against the project.
Chinatown liaison Lisa Hy encouraged residents to send their concerns and comments to the Mayor’s office, City Councilor Ed Flynn and the Zoning Board of Appeal.
The final hearing for the billboard project will be held Feb. 25 at 11:30 a.m. at City Hall.
The owner of Friendship BBQ will apply to extend his operation hours to 2 a.m. The restaurant also plans to serve alcohol. Residents expressed concern the restaurant would attract drunk crowds and disturb nearby residents.

Boston Assistant Commissioner of the Health Division Dan Manning also stopped by the meeting to address concerns over the novel coronavirus and reassure residents the health inspection process for restaurants has not changed. There is no extra risk to dine in Chinatown. There will be a community meeting on Feb. 7 to give updates and recommendations on the issue at Josiah Quincy Elementary School. The meeting starts at 6:30 p.m. and will be in English and Cantonese.

Regional manager Roxann Cooke explained Chase is not just a transactional business, but focuses on relationships.
“Once a customer told me she felt like she was on a first date when she came in to open an account,” said Cooke.
Every branch is different, based on the community and Chase hires all employees locally. The Chinatown branch has 15 employees who speak nine different languages.

“We know banking. We’re learning the community,” Cooke said.
To better engage the community, the Chinatown location will host “Chase Chat” community sessions on topics such as small businesses and savings every Thursday from 11:30 to 12:30 p.m. These sessions will be open to the public and free of any charge.

20200205,Chinatown Safety Committee discusses local crime,"Boston Police Dept. District A-1 Sgt. Steve Moy spoke about local crime Feb. 5 at the Chinatown Safety Committee at the DoubleTree Hotel. (Image courtesy of Ling-Mei Wong.)
The Chinatown Safety Committee met Feb. 5 at the DoubleTree Hotel for a local crime report and a Greenway update.
Boston Police Dept. District A-1 Sgt. Steve Moy gave an update on Chinatown and downtown crime for the past 30 days. Several shoplifting incidents took place at the CVS Pharmacy on Washington Street, as its security officers no longer confront suspects directly, after a Dallas security guard shot and killed a shoplifter in July 2017.
Three drug arrests was made around the China Trade Building, Moy said. Officers arrested two cocaine dealers and a heroin seller, who were well-known to the District A-1 Drug Control unit.
A suspect was arrested Jan. 7 for selling stolen items, including 30 boxes of cigarettes, at the Mary Soo Hoo Park, Moy said.
A phone was recovered after a woman contacted police, Moy said.
The Greenway is installing Year of the Mouse public art “A Mouse with Ears and Tail” by Furen Dai, said Rachel Lake, marketing and community affairs director. The Year of the Pig’s eight ceramic pigs by Elliott Kayser have been removed.
Boston is vetting locations for a public bathroom on the Greenway, after a previous suggested location was found unsuitable, Lake said.

20200203,Year of the Rat brings lion dance parade to Chinatown,"Lion dancers from Woo Ching’s White Crane Kung Fu parade down Tyler Street in Chinatown Feb. 2. (Image courtesy of Mandy Sun.)
The sounds of firecrackers and drums echoed throughout Chinatown Feb. 2 for the annual Chinese New Year parade, held on the second Sunday after Lunar New Year began Jan. 25.
Lion dancers in bright colors traveled to 150 stores in the neighborhood. A steady beat by the drums and a masked Happy Buddha dancer accompanied the lions. The lions stopped in the front of each business, bakery or restaurant to inspect the oranges, cabbages and red envelopes placed on small tables. The lions are fed the oranges, cabbages and red envelopes, and in turn, the lion bows three times as a sign of gratitude. They will then throw the oranges into the air and stamp on the cabbages, both symbolizing a spread of good luck. If someone catches an orange, the person will get special good luck for the entire year. Firecrackers are lit to scare evil spirits.
Kung fu groups and dance troupes were invited to perform, including Nam Pai Kung Fu Academy, Hung Gar Kung Fu and Lion Dance, and Wah Lum Kung Fu and Tai Chi Academy. Marlon Violette joined Wah Lum 21 years ago. As lion dance is entertaining and colorful, this tradition is important to the Chinatown community. Violette said, “This culture is very deep, has been around for thousands and thousands of years, and this tradition will always be here.”
Gary Bogoff visited Chinatown for the second time to see the parade. He felt amazed by the colors, costumes, firecrackers, and dances. Bogoff said, “The fact that everybody is sharing the history and culture is very important … I’m glad to see it happen.”
The annual lion dance parade was hosted by the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association. It also held a cultural village at its 90 Tyler Street headquarters. The Pao Arts Center had crafts and a lion dance workshop, while Chinatown Main Street had cultural activities at the Chinatown Trade Center.
