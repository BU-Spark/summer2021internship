reacted swiftly Friday to the closing of Touch 106 1 FM  a popular unlicensed radio station that bills itself as the fabric of the black community Patrick said he had received advance warning from the US attorney’s office about the federal raid on the station and had urged the office not to proceed  But US marshals and agents from the Federal Communications Commission went to the Grove Hall station Thursday and shut it down  n“I’m incredibly disappointed ” Patrick said  responding to reporters’ questions  “I understand what the legal basis is  but you’d like to think of their bringing more of a problem solving approach  Touch is a pretty important voice in the community  I’ve been on it many times and have tremendous respect for the team over there ”City councilors and state representatives vowed Friday to exhaust every option to get the station up and running  saying it is a community institution  information resource  and vehicle for civic engagement and social change “At this point  we are gathering information and working collaboratively as       elected officials to get Touch 106 1 licensed and back on the airwaves ’’ City Councilor at Large Ayanna Pressley said Pressley said she spoke with the station’s founder  Charles L  Clemons Jr   this week  and added she appreciated that federal agents allowed the station’s founder to announce on the air Thursday that the station had been shut down  nState Representative Russell Holmes  whose district includes Mattapan and Dorchester  said nine lawmakers of color have been inundated with calls and text messages from constituents urging them to save Touch  n“We’ve heard a loud cry from our constituents who want us to do something about this ’’  Holmes said The politicians sent a statement to the media  saying they had been in contact with the FCC and are working with members of Congress Holmes said the lawmakers plan first to examine how many other unlicensed low power stations exist in Boston that serve a significant community purpose  Then  he said  the lawmakers will determine how they can be kept on the air Patrick said his office has been in contact with a lawyer for the station and with the FCC in hopes of resolving the matter Clemons announced on air the station was shutting Thursday  Pressley said  The station posted the closing on Twitter  Federal agents seized all radio station transmission equipment  antennas  radio frequency power amplifiers  radio frequency test equipment  and other devices used to transmit signals from 5 Cheney St   where the station was housed in a nonprofit run by Clemons’s mother US Attorney Carmen M  Ortiz’s office said on Wednesday and Thursday it seized radio equipment from Touch and two other stations  88 7 FM in Brockton and 100 1 FM  which had signals in Everett  Dorchester  Brockton  and Mattapan The US attorney’s office said the FCC issued multiple warnings to all three illegal operators  but the stations continued to broadcast  Ortiz’s office brought forfeiture actions after it received complaints  including from a licensed broadcaster who said there was interference with its radio signal “It is a public safety hazard for illegal radio stations to broadcast  potentially interfering with critical radio communications ” Ortiz said in a statement Since 2011  Ortiz’s office said it has filed forfeiture actions against eight illegal radio stations in Greater Boston  effectively shutting them down Clemons has been the target of the FCC since 2008 when the agency slapped him and the station with a $17 000 fine for operating illegally  Court records said he ignored warnings and refused to let agents into the studio Agents said they launched a new investigation after receiving a complaint last year that Clemons was using his station to promote his unsuccessful 2013 mayoral bid Clemons did not return a call from the Globe Friday seeking comment  The station continues to operate online The closing of the radio station sparked ami  reaction among industry representatives and community residents who said it raised questions about the limited number of FCC licenses in certain communities and the high cost to obtain them  They also contend there is a need to have an on air voice in underrepresented communities that are often shut out from getting expensive radio licenses “That is a conversation worthy of discourse ’’ said Jack Casey  the general manager of radio station WERS  which broadcasts from Emerson College  “Media access is worthy of a conversation ”It was Casey’s station that sparked the FCC probe of 88 7 FM in Brockton  Last year  a consultant for the Emerson station looked into a complaint from listeners that another station was interfering with WERS’s signal on 88 9 FM Federal agents investigating the issue tracked the signal to a brown  two story home on Crescent Street in Brockton and observed an antenna on a roof with a cable snaking into a boarded up window  according to court documents unsealed this week They placed warnings on two of the home’s doors and sent a certified letter to the building owner  Solange Germain  the documents show  On Wednesday  US marshals put a lid on the station Federal agents also shut an unlicensed station operating on 100 1 FM — in four different houses in Everett  Brockton  Mattapan  and Dorchester — after trying unsuccessfully to work with the owner  Gerlens Cesar  documents show “I warned Mr  Cesar that he needed to shut off his transmitter at the three reported locations as soon as possible ’’ an agent said in court records The

season on the PGA Tour  Can you name them The easy answer is Rory McIlroy  who won all three of his tour events in succession  first the Open Championship  then the Bridgestone Invitational  followed by the PGA Championship  That’s three big events  coming in a four week span  Those victories were recent  impressive  and hard to forget  the world’s top ranked player doing what top ranked players do  win  and often  t nBut how about the second player with three wins  Any idea OK  here’s a hint  He’s led the FedEx Cup points standings for 35 weeks this season  that’s a record  Another hint  He’ll make his Ryder Cup debut next month in Scotland Still stumped  One more helper  He’s an award winning astrophotographer  Yes  you read that right Jimmy Walker might be impressing more people with his camera and telescope than he is with his golf equipment  Considering the breakout season Walker has had— there’s probably a bad out of this world joke in there somewhere — that’s certainly saying something  t n“I feel like I’ve played well ” Walker said last week at the Barclays  “Obviously I would have liked to have won again  but before this year it had taken me 180 times before I had one  I’ve continued to play well  I’ve got a lot of top 10s  I’ve played good in the big tournaments  and I’m looking to win again ”Because the most recent of his three victories came more than six months ago  Walker might not be mentioned among the favorites at this week’s Deutsche Bank Championship  He still might be flying under the radar  a position he’s known for much of his nine year PGA Tour career Even now  near the end of a season in which he’s collected three wins  nine top 10 finishes  and a spot on the upcoming US Ryder Cup team  Walker can do much of his work in peaceful anonymity  He’s not an up and coming young gun  he’s 35   he’s not seen in TV commercials like McIlroy or Rickie Fowler  and he’s probably not near the top of the list if you polled fans for their favorite player But he’s making his presence known among his peers   n“I have to say that I’ve played with Jimmy Walker ” said Tom Watson  who will be Walker’s Ryder Cup captain  “He’s got a game that’s just spectacular  He can flat get it  He knows how to maneuver the ball  He’s a great putter ”This marks the first wraparound season that the PGA Tour has ever had  the points and money earned began counting last October  when the 2014 15 season began  Walker won the first event  the Frys com Open  to break his winless drought on the PGA Tour in his 188th start  Victories followed at the Sony Open and the AT T Pebble Beach National Pro Am  which gave Walker three wins in his first eight starts of the season  nDespite not winning since  Walker has continued to play well  Look at his finishes this year in golf’s biggest events  He tied for eighth in his Masters debut  then tied for sixth at the Players Championship  At the US Open  Walker tied for ninth  then he tied for 26th at the Open Championship  Three weeks ago  Walker tied for seventh at the PGA Championship  nOnly Matt Kuchar  with 11  has more top 10 finishes this season than Walker   n“I’ve just felt very confident and my expectation levels are higher ” Walker said  “I feel like I should be there  I think that’s one of the biggest factors this year  really get used to seeing your name on the leaderboard  I’ve come to enjoy that fact and relish it  That’s why I’m out here  to be up there and try to be at the top and try to win ”This recent ascension to the top of the golf world — Walker is ranked 20th in the world and fell from second to third in the points race after the Barclays — mirrors his fascination with astrophotography  Walker asked his wife for a telescope for Christmas a few years back  received one  but it didn’t come with a camera  which is the main reason he wanted it  Once he found a model that could take pictures  he’s been snapping away ever since Walker rents space at an elevated place in New Mexico  and with very high tech equipment can take and work on his pictures remotely  when he’s on the road playing golf  He does that frequently  establishing a website  www jwalk smugmug com  that features his pictures  which he also posts on Twitter   JimmyWalkerPGA   Galaxies  nebulae  star formations  moon closeups  and planets are all part of Walker’s portfolio  His photos have become works of art  colorful creations of red and blue and orange set against the deep  dark blackness of space  It serves as a reminder of how large everything is out there  and how small everything is down here “Being outside and outdoors and seeing the sky from a really dark place is really cool  I don’t think a lot of people really ever get to do that  truly ” Walker said  after he won the Sony Open  “I got hooked on  astrophotography   It was something to keep my mind occupied and keep the brain working ”Maybe having a hobby on the side has helped Walker with his day job  This season’s golf has taken him to a place he’d never been  Until recently  when McIlroy won the PGA  Walker was still No  1 in the points standings  where he’d been every tournament he’s played this year except one  That was the Sony  which he won  A third win  this one at Pebble Beach  assured Walker of an automatic spot on the Ryder Cup team “Yeah  it’s on my mind  It’s just kind of a carrot at the end of the year ” Walker said last week at the Barclays  where he missed just his fourth cut of the season  “I think it shows that you had a really good year to make that team  you’ve played well and you’ve played consistently  I’m excited “When you win  I think you want to win again and then you want to win again ”Three wins  That’s exactly what Walker has done      nWalker is a

Wi Fi network for about 30 000 residents living in the Grove Hall neighborhood as the first step to blanketing much of the city with wireless Internet service Dubbed Wicked Free Wi Fi  the network of outdoor Wi Fi hotspots will provide Internet coverage over an area of about 1 5 square miles  making it easier for users with smartphones and tablets to access the Internet on the go  nThe signal will be strong enough for many households within the coverage area to surf the Web  check e mail  and use social media  Connection speeds will be just strong enough to live stream a movie or video of medium quality And over the next two years  the Walsh administration plans to extend the Wi Fi network to all 20 commercial districts that are part of the city’s Main Streets neighborhoods program  Those areas are eligible for federal grant money to fund community development projects  nGrove Hall was selected as the launch site because of its large number of low income families who may not be able to afford the high cost of speedy broadband service “We are launching this in a neighborhood where there’s not a lot of access to Wi Fi ” said Mayor Martin J  Walsh  who is scheduled to announce the citywide network at an event Wednesday in Grove Hall  “There are certain parts of the city where service just goes down ”Boston had Wi Fi hotspots scattered around the city before this rollout — about 70 access points in a few tourist districts or at municipal properties  However  those hotspots reach just a short distance  and do not have the kind of wide area blanket coverage as the Grove Hall network should provide The city stresses that the new Wi Fi network isn’t designed to be used inside homes as a replacement for wired services that residents can buy from commercial providers  Rather it will work best for mobile users  and is largely intended to be accessed outdoors or in the restaurants and cafes around the neighborhood  It will cover the area centered around Grove Hall and reach as far as Columbus Road to the west  and Columbia Road to the east  and north up Blue Hill Avenue to the edge of Dudley Square The Wi Fi access points will connect users to the Web via the city’s own high speed fiber optic network “It’s not our goal to blanket the city with indoor coverage ” said Justin Holmes  Boston’s interim chief information officer However  the Wi Fi expansion puts Boston on pace with many other municipalities around the country  such as New York and San Francisco  that are building wireless networks as a relatively inexpensive way to extend the reach of the Internet to underserved areas  New York City is building the largest public wireless network for a 95 block area in Harlem to connect some 93 000 residents  San Francisco provides free Wi Fi to its public housing developments Those municipal Wi Fi networks can’t compete with high speed Internet connections that many commercial providers  such as Comcast Corp  and RCN Corp   offer — at subscriptions that can top $100 a month  when bundled with other services The stiff price for high speed Internet has prompted tech giant Google Inc  to begin installing an all fiber optic network  beginning first in Kansas City  Kan   that promises Internet service 100 times faster than average broadband  starting at $70 a month The Google Fiber project has prompted many cities to explore new ways of expanding Internet availability  including building faster networks on their own  said Esme Vos  founder of Muniwireless com  a resource for public wireless networks “People are saying  ‘Why can’t we have that here ’ u2002” said Vos It’s not just the convenience of streaming movies or chatting on Facebook  Vos said  Internet access has become indispensable for students to do their homework  and job seekers to find work “You can’t even file job applications today if you aren’t online ” Vos said  “It’s part of the literacy that we expect people to have ”Chattanooga  Tenn   for example  recently built its own fiber networks that will bring ultrafast Web service to residents’ homes Such systems  though  are extraordinarily expensive  beyond the means of most cities’ finances  Chattanooga  for example  used stimulus funds from the federal government to help pay for the $330 million fiber network  and even so  will charge residents at least $58 a month Former mayor Thomas M  Menino tried but failed to persuade Google to select Boston as one of its fiber communities  Menino also had a long running dispute with Verizon over the telecom giant’s refusal to offer its high speed fiber optic FiOS network to Boston residents So as elsewhere  a Wi Fi network was the most convenient and cost effective option for Boston The Grove Hall project was born during Menino’s administration  which was awarded a $20 5 million federal grant from the Department of Housing and Urban Development in 2011 that set aside money for redevelopment projects in Dorchester  About $300 000 was used for the Grove Hall build out Barbara Fields  HUD’s New England regional director  said improved Internet access has become a crucial component for bettering the lives of the city’s low income residents “This idea to take a section of the city and provide Internet is an investment that will reap a lot of benefits ” said Fields  “This puts Grove Hall right in the center of things ”Walsh hopes the network helps boost economic development around Grove Hall  and eventually in the city’s other Main Streets districts  by dangling free Wi Fi to attract new businesses to these underserved parts of Boston “This is important for our economy ” said Walsh  “It spurs economic development ”Walsh has made improving Internet access a key part of his mayoral agenda and has said he plans on improving service to schools and businesses  as well  He said the Grove Hall project was a first step in that direction  but has not elaborated on other measures Because it’s public Wi Fi  the Grove Hall network has some of the same security risks associated with similar Internet connections available in coffee shops or libraries  In general  security experts warn against using these networks to send personal details such as credit card information  So  users shopping online may want to use a more secure Web connection The network will include about 100 wireless units that will be placed in locations around Roxbury and Dorchester  Each unit has a signal of about 300 feet  Even though the network is just starting to be publicized  nearly 10 000 people a day have found their way onto the network since it was turned on with little fanfare in March Boston will install signs around the city in the coming weeks to advertise the Wi Fi network  And this being a public network  Wicked Free Wi Fi will have limits  Users won’t be able to access pornography  malicious content  gambling websites  or sites that allow people to improperly download copyrighted material such as

mystery stunned this Cape Cod community and puzzled investigators who asked the public Friday for help in identifying the victim  The body is believed to have been left on the beach between Monday and 7 or 8 p m  Wednesday  when it was found by someone walking on the beach “We are seeking information from the public regarding this discovery ” said Cape and Islands District Attorney Michael O’Keefe

suspicious object and found it wrapped in trash bags and the tarp  They discovered the body after carefully removing the wrapping  O’Keefe said Authorities have said they do not believe the man was

home looking for help Thursday “They wanted to know if we had cameras on the house that might have captured anything on the beach ” Laughrea said in a phone interview Investigators worked through the night to collect evidence and want to hear from anyone who may have noticed any vehicles operating erratically around the beach between Monday and Wednesday  O’Keefe said Officials with the Warwick company did not respond to a phone call and e mail O’Keefe said officials do not believe this case is linked to the death of Dennis Ray Jackson  who was killed and his body dismembered last fall  Parts of Jackson’s body were found burning in November in a barrel near the Bridgewater Correctional Complex and behind an industrial building in Boston’s Hyde Park section “We don’t feel they’re

Andrew Square Saturday night  holding his cane  when he was suddenly attacked from behind  A young man yanked the man’s cane  and before the victim  who is disabled  could react  he was struck in the chest and head with his own white walking stick  police said The attack  which took place just after 11 p m   was captured by surveillance cameras at the MBTA stop  which also recorded the attacker casually walking away from his victim  police said  The attacker  described by authorities as being between 25 and his early 30s  was still holding the cane as he sauntered away from the bus depot toward Dorchester Avenue “It’s a shocking type of crime ” said Transit Police Superintendent in Chief Joseph O’Connor  “He took the cane away from him for no apparent reason ”On Monday  Transit Police released the video of the attack and posted it on their Twitter account  calling the crime “disgusting ” Officials are asking the public to help them find the attacker  who was wearing a bulky red jacket with a bright blue sweater underneath  jeans  and a red hat  The incident was also a reminder that disabled and elderly riders are more likely to be victims of criminals who rob or attack them for no apparent reason “Whether it’s a senior  a blind person  or a person with a mobility device  you have a tendency to be more vulnerable ” said James White  chairman of the Access Advisory Committee to the MBTA  the official organization representing riders with disabilities  Criminals “feel like you’re less of a danger to them ” White said The attacker in Saturday night’s incident took only his victim’s cane  O’Connor said  Video surveillance also shows the assailant walking down the stairs of the T station just before the attack  In that image  he is walking with a young woman and appears to be swaying back and forth  almost as if he were drunk  The woman is no longer with him when he attacks the disabled man about 15 minutes later O’Connor said he has no idea what motivated the attack “But looking at the video and the way he’s going down the stairs         he may have been under the influence of something ” O’Connor said  “Otherwise  I don’t know what would make him do that  There is nothing that we see that he is provoked in any way ”After the attack  the video shows the victim standing alone  holding his chest  A couple of people appear nearby  but do not approach the victim to help him  It is not clear from the video if those people witnessed the attack Police said the victim walked nearly a half mile from Andrew Square to the Transit Police station on Southampton Street to report the attack O’Connor said he hopes that anyone who was there that night will come forward with information that could help authorities catch the attacker Between 2011 and 2012  larcenies and robberies fell at Andrew Square from 12 incidents to four  according to Transit Police figures  Assaults rose from two in 2011 to four in 2012  O’Connor said Transit Police are still compiling crime statistics for 2013 But he said incidents like Saturday’s  in which disabled people are attacked and robbed for something with no obvious monetary value  are rare White  however  said he believes many incidents similar to Saturday’s go unreported because victims are embarrassed or scared  More assaults occur on buses than on subway cars  White said In the next year  the T will begin extended night hours  with some buses and subways running until 3 a m  on the weekends as part of a new one year pilot program  nAsked if Saturday’s attack will influence security plans for that

When he enters a cafe in Braintree on a recent morning  he fills the doorway  When he orders breakfast  it’s eight eggs  hash browns  and toast   At 6 feet 5 inches tall  Lavery weighs 220 pounds  “My leg was about 50 pounds  so I’m about 50 pounds lighter than I would be ” he notes  t nThat would be his right leg  which was amputated below the knee last year after an Afghan police officer opened fire on Lavery’s Green Beret team Lavery  a 32 year old staff sergeant stationed at Fort Bragg  N C   was here to visit family in Franklin and to accept the James E  Cotter Courage Award from BC High  named for its former football coach and athletic director  It’s a great honor for a BC High kid  but Lavery has a few other medals to his name  three Purple Hearts  a Silver Star  a Bronze Star  and a Bronze Star with Valor  for heroism in combat  His story is one of courage and selflessness  and offers a humbling lesson during a holiday season that is often more about getting than about giving  Over breakfast  he speaks of his service in the Army Special Forces  which he joined after graduating from college in 2007  Sitting next to him was Mary Rizzo  whose son Jonathan was Lavery’s best childhood friend  Lavery  who grew up in Kingston  spent a lot of time at the Rizzo home  and went with Jonathan to BC High in Dorchester  “He’s my fourth son ” is the way Mary Rizzo puts it “Ma” is what he calls her  In 2001  Jonathan  a 19 year old student at George Washington University  was carjacked and killed by Gary Sampson — who has admitted to three slayings and is facing the death penalty — after he stopped to help what seemed to be a stranded motorist   After enveloping the petite Rizzo in his enormous embrace  Lavery settles in to tell his story  The affection between them is evident  and she looks both pained and proud as he talks His first deployment to Afghanistan was in 2011  In September 2012  his team was sent to Wardak province  a hotbed of fighting  The next month  his shoulder took shrapnel from a rocket propelled grenade “It blew a lemon sized hole out of my right shoulder ” he says  He refused to be evacuated for medical care  instead plugging the wound with some gauze  Finally  he was sent to Bagram Air Base to be patched up A month later  a truck in his unit was hit by a roadside bomb  Lavery  two trucks behind  ran to the site  “There were three enemies firing at the vehicle ” he recalls  “I neutralized two of them  The third one took off running ”Lavery took off after him  and was hit by a bullet in the face   “I went down  but I popped back up ” The truck  on its side in a ditch  was on fire  and Lavery was certain he’d find dead bodies “I was amazed when I found Captain Nieman in the rubble  awake ” he says of his commanding officer  The others had been blown out of the truck but would also survive  Both of Nieman’s legs were mangled  he had a severed artery in one arm  and the truck’s ammunition was starting to fire because of the heat “And we’re still getting shot at ” says Lavery  “I was pretty sure we weren’t going to make it out ”If Lavery is a big guy  Captain Seth Nieman is bigger  An offensive lineman at West Point  he stands 6 feet 6 and 300 pounds — 370 in all his equipment  The team liked to joke that Nieman and Lavery could never ride in the same vehicle because no one else in the group could move either of them if they were wounded Nieman  who lost the lower half of his right leg in the explosion  told his local newspaper in North Dakota about Lavery last year  “When my vehicle was on its side  on fire  he was the only one big enough and strong enough to pull me out  He got shot  too  He got up five minutes later — that was his second Purple Heart — and got me out of there ”In March 2013  Lavery  too  would lose part of his right leg  his team was training local forces when an Afghan police officer opened fire with a machine gun  Lavery says he hit the ground  but a young soldier next to him froze  That’s when Lavery put himself between the teen and the gunfire  tackling the kid and dragging him behind a truck And that’s when he was hit  several times  in the leg  He knew his femoral artery had been severed and he’d soon bleed out  so he grabbed a tourniquet from his kit  Some of his team  including the captain who had taken Nieman’s place  were killed  It was an hour before a helicopter could land and evacuate the others  At the Army base  Lavery’s body started to shut down  Turns out they had given him six units of the wrong blood type  despite the fact that soldiers all wear their blood type on their boots  their dog tags  and  ntheir uniforms At Bagram  they gave him a full blood transfusion and put him on dialysis  He had 20 surgeries there  and after he was stabilized  he was sent to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center near Washington  D C   where he had several more  After two months  he was discharged and began rehabilitation with a prosthesis When offered medical retirement  Lavery said no  He is now a tactical combat instructor at Fort Bragg  and is working with training coaches to reach his goal of returning to combat “I would be on the next plane out ” he says  “Someone has to do the job  and I take enormous pride in it ” Lavery knows the war is controversial  “I don’t think it’s a situation we can completely abandon ” he says  “But I do think we should get rid of conventional forces and leave smaller  specialized units for intelligence collection and surgical strikes  I think there’s a big upside financially and for the American people to know we’re ‘at peace ’ But we can’t turn our backs on the part of the world that still poses a dangerous threat to us ”Mary Rizzo has left the cafe  She had visited Lavery at Walter Reed and seen his injuries up close  and she still worries about him  She’ll see him that night at the awards ceremony', '2014_455')","('Instead of a cookout on a sunny and warm Sunday afternoon before Memorial Day  Eva Leaston brought her teenage sons Elijah and Ronald from Brockton to Mount Hope Cemetery in Mattapan to help plant flowers along the graves of family members who were veterans It’s an annual

were great people and they fought for our country ” said 18 year old Elijah  who had just planted flowers at the grave of World War II Army veteran Wilmer Leaston  “It does inspire me ”A few lots away was Mary Fuller of Somerville with about 10 members of her family placing flowers at the grave of her former father in law and World War II Army veteran Emile D  Jacquard  It was a joyous affair for the group  spanning several generations  as they shared stories of their ancestry before going out for dim sum “We’re just amongst ourselves like  ‘Oh  I never knew that ’ u2009” Fuller said of the stories the family shared “It’s fun for us to share how people were related ” added her niece Rachel Lee  “We’re learning today ”The two groups were among a handful of families who paid respects to fallen veterans at Mount Hope Sunday afternoon  just a couple of hours after the city’s annual Memorial Day observance there  which was attended by only about a dozen people under gray morning skies  nIn brief remarks at the foot of the World War I and World War II memorials  almost every speaker lamented the troubling trend of fewer people attending the annual observance organized by American Legion District 7 “My only regret is that the numbers each year seem to dwindle ” said Cynthia Johnson Smith  former president of the American Legion Auxiliary of Massachusetts  “But we are here  We can never forget  even though we may have other plans for this weekend  this is our priority  We must always remember the men and women who lie here today and across the state ”Francisco Urena  the city’s veteran services commissioner  spoke on behalf of Mayor Martin J  Walsh  saying it was an honor to remember the more than 15 000 veterans buried at the cemetery  spanning conflicts from the Civil War to the present “May we remember the reason why we have Memorial Day — it is not a time to head to the beach  it is not a time to open up those barbecues ” Urena said  “There’s a time to remember all those who have sacrificed so that we may have the right to do all those great things that we do ”The tribute included color guards  a gun salute by the American Legion Fogg Robert Post 78  and a band playing traditional military music  including “Taps ”“They’re heroes  that’s what they are  They defended our country ” said Elizabeth Wing of Newton  who attended the ceremony with husband  Jones Wing  a Korean War Army veteran  She said the low attendance depressed her  “It bothers me that barbecues are more important ” City Councilor Charles C  Yancey urged the crowd to remember the men and women in active conflicts today  who “offer their lives for the rights that even today we take for granted ”“Every year we gather and seemingly every year we have more and more empty seats and that is a sad reminder about how much we take for granted ” Yancey said  “Every citizen of the United States has an obligation to say ‘thank you’ to the families of our loved ones who gave their lives for our way of life ”Just before the start of the observance  Matthew Seto  commander of American Legion Boston Chinatown Post 328  scanned the cemetery  looking over the sea of graves decorated with American flags and stressed the importance of remembering the country’s heroes “A lot of sacrifice is made  and taking one day out of the year to come here to see all these flags  for  all of these servicemen and women  it’s an important part of our civic duty as Americans ” said Seto  a Marine who served in Iraq  “This is just one day out of your weekend  taking one hour  two

threatening  nOfficers were not sure late Wednesday what prompted the altercation  who was involved  and where exactly it took place  No arrests had been made  Police first responded to a call for the stabbing at 12 42 p m   Sullivan said “It appears the incident originated on a Red Line train  and as the train stopped at Shawmut Station to allow passengers to board and exit  it spilled onto the Shawmut platform ” he said A preliminary investigation suggested that both stabbings occurred on the southbound platform By the time detectives arrived  the suspects had fled  Sullivan said investigators later located a person suffering from a stab wound near Leslie Street and another around Dorchester and Welles avenues  nWitnesses told The Globe they saw three teenagers attack a boy

” she said Three teenagers ran out of the station  Greenberg said  The boy who had been stabbed grabbed a knife and ran after them Greenberg said that she approached the boy’s grandmother  who called

suburbs to claim a narrow victory over Democrat Martha Coakley in the governor’s race  according to a Globe analysis of election returns Four years after falling short in his first gubernatorial race  Baker made substantial improvements on the South Shore and in the Worcester suburbs  while lopping 11 points off Democratic margins in Boston and Springfield  t n“The key was how we performed in traditional Democratic areas ” said Jim Conroy  Baker’s campaign manager Operatives with both campaigns said the town by town results show Baker met his central strategic challenge  appeasing conservative voters eager for a change  while projecting the sort of compassionate centrism necessary to make inroads with independents and Democrats “They had a solid strategy from Day 1 and they executed it pretty flawlessly ” said Doug Rubin  Coakley’s chief strategist  “They were disciplined ”Baker’s two point margin of victory was tighter than some polls showed in the closing days of the race  and thinner than his campaign would have liked The Republican’s substantial financial edge and string of newspaper endorsements did not produce the gains supporters hoped for in cities such as Lowell and Attleboro  He did no better in those two places than he did in 2010 But Baker made double digit gains in key stretches of the conservative South Shore  And in the Worcester suburbs of Auburn  Holden  and Boylston  he added 16 or 17 points to the margins he built four years ago in his race against Governor Deval Patrick Lou DiNatale  a Democratic political strategist in central Massachusetts  said the area is turning into a full bore “regional Republican base ” crucial to the fortunes of any GOP candidate running statewide The city of Worcester has been an island of blue in the region  But Coakley won it by just 11 points Tuesday  falling far short of the margins built by Democrats such as Senator Elizabeth Warren  25 points in 2012  and Patrick  27 points in 2010    It was a pattern that repeated itself in the state’s largest cities  Mariama White Hammond  a Dorchester political activist who advised Martin J  Walsh during the Boston mayoral race last year  said Coakley was not able to generate the passion Patrick stirred in urban centers “When people walked away from Deval Patrick  they felt something ” she said  “That’s just not who Coakley is ”Election returns show Baker  a former budget chief in the Weld and Cellucci administrations and health insurance executive  made his biggest gains in whiter  wealthier parts of Boston — Charlestown  West Roxbury  South Boston  and the Back Bay  A high profile effort to court black leaders in Dorchester and Roxbury  part of what Baker’s campaign called its “urban strategy ” yielded only modest gains in those neighborhoods  But it may have softened his image with suburban voters willing to consider a moderate Republican The overture was one of several centrist signals sent to this crucial demographic Baker talked about his openly gay brother and emphasized his support for abortion rights  And he parried small controversies over the minimum wage and climate change before they turned into something larger  Baker strategist Will Keyser said the campaign did not get “trapped by issues that can haunt Republican candidates ”Emily Norton  a Newton alderman who volunteered for Coakley  said Baker emerged as an acceptable alternative for many of her neighbors  “We’re Massachusetts ” she said  “We don’t like the extreme right wingers that we see nationally  But Charlie Baker — his views on gay marriage  I guess he came around on climate — he was viewed as a moderate ”Baker lost Newton by 21 points  But that marked a substantial improvement over his last showing in the liberal suburb  In 2010  he lost it by 37 points Baker made similar gains in nearby Brookline and Belmont  And he made more modest improvements in liberal western Massachusetts enclaves such as Amherst and Northampton Steve Koczela  president of the MassInc Polling Group  said the Baker map — his inroads with urban and suburban voters — is just part of a broader story  Public opinion surveys showed him making gains among women  independents  and several other key constituencies in the closing weeks of the campaign “The truth is almost every demographic group was trending toward Baker ” he said  “There was almost no group that didn’t lean more toward Baker at the end  of the race  than at the beginning ” n', '2014_542')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no

control  and befriend him ” Borders said inside the packed Mattapan church  “Some people are going to talk about         what government ought to be doing  but we have personal responsibility  We have a responsibility as men of God  Jesus won the world with 12 men ”  t tIn a city that began 2014 with a series of violent killings that roiled the community  where a 9 year old boy died of a gunshot wound 48 hours earlier  Borders and other ministers called for community members to work for peace  Borders invited gang members — who police say are behind much of the violence — to come to the church and find salvation  and he called on men in the congregation to do their part  “We’re going to make a vow as men of God here now that we’re not going to respond to challenges in our lives with violence ” he said  Two miles away  at Pleasant Hill Baptist Church in Dorchester  the Rev  Miniard Culpepper made a similar plea  Culpepper  a leading religious voice against guns and gangs in the city  said times had changed “To have a gun on a kitchen table         ” Culpepper said  in an apparent reference to the fatal shooting of the child   t t n“There was a time when we had Bibles on the kitchen table  When everyone went to the table  there was a Bible there ” he continued  “And  so this morning  the community is mourning the loss of one of our children ”The 9 year old was shot by his 14 year old brother Friday morning  in an apparent accident in the family’s Morton Street home  Authorities have not identified the children The teenager was charged with unlawful gun possession and involuntary manslaughter and is scheduled to be arraigned Monday in a closed juvenile session at Dorchester Municipal Court  Police had been called to the home last June  when the teenager allegedly assaulted the 9 year old and their mother No one answered the door at the home Sunday  A woman answered the phone belonging to the victim’s mother but declined to identify herself or talk about the case  telling a a reporter  “We just need our time ” At a Chinese New Year celebration in Chinatown  Mayor Martin J  Walsh told reporters that he supports President Obama’s push for increased federally mandated background checks on firearm purchases  He said enhancing national gun control measures could help curb violence in Boston because firearms move across state lines “The fact that a 14 year old had a gun in the first place  there’s something wrong with that ” the mayor said  “Most of these guns are coming from out of state — states that don’t have tough gun laws ” Walsh called the death of the 9 year old “terrible ” He did not discuss the investigation but said of the recent violence  “there’s not an easy solution here ” On Saturday  the mayor said his administration will work with Boston police to institute a gun buyback program  in an effort to reduce the number of guns circulating in the city  On Monday  police will meet with clergy and members of Roxbury based Mothers for Justice and Equality to discuss supplementing outreach to at risk youths with support for mothers and other family members  Monalisa Smith  president and chief executive of the mothers’ organization  said the meeting had been planned before the Mattapan shooting but the boy’s death would be an important topic on their agenda  nWhen police were called to the home last summer  Smith said  there was a missed opportunity  for the kind of holistic family intervention possible through a collaboration between her organization and Operation Homefront  a police clergy partnership “If you think about it  we could have avoided that ” Smith said of the death  “This is a good case study for us to look and say  how can we collaborate to provide support services ”During the Pleasant Hill service  Culpepper said he didn’t know the family but spoke of the tragedy of losing a child “He’s just beginning to add and subtract  and write nice  grammatically correct sentences ” he said  “Just beginning to understand the history of our nation and our whole world ”Parishioners said they found solace in Culpepper’s words “All I did was pray for peace  and for this family  when I heard about what happened ” said Alice Gaskings  55  of Roslindale  who attended church with her 19 year old grandson Shanitha Blocker  36  attended with her three children  ages 17  10  and 4  She said she “cried and prayed” about the shooting  which she said was “just such a tragedy ”Blocker  like others  wondered why the boys weren’t in school  “Why were they home on a school day ” she asked  “I have a teenager  and I know how hard it can be to raise them  But where did that gun come from ”Following the Morning Star service  congregants echoed Borders’s message  saying men need to do more to support each other  act as role models  and intervene when they see young men in trouble  Ryan Sands  19  who grew up in Orange  Conn   said he had gotten into a little trouble when he was younger but had a devoted father and other strong male role models who set him straight  “My own father  he definitely made sure that all the men in our house were tight and close knit  that we build each other up ” he said  Lance Smith  23  who lives in Grove Hall  said he tries to get along with everyone  but he has seen violence erupt from simple misunderstandings  “Things could get off on the wrong foot

east wind a plague ”“I believe there was a windstorm that destroyed the farms  the plantations  in Cape Verde ” Gomes responded This was Newman’s first Cape Verdean Jewish Seder  and he acknowledged  knowing little about the West African island nation “All I knew about Cape Verde was that it was a Portuguese colony that gained independence ” the 56 year old said  “Nothing else ”Sitting across from him was Antonio Correia  who left Cape Verde more than 30 years ago and said he knew little about Passover except that grocery stores dedicate a page of ads in their circulars to food of the holiday this time of year  He also knew nothing of his native land’s Jewish history “Cape Verde is a mix of many cultures  so even if you’re right next to a person  you might not even know ” he said “But look ” Correia said  pointing to a piece of paper filled with a handwritten note with the names of temples on one side and the five books of the Torah on the other  “They gave me all kinds of information ”Rocky  rugged  and volcanic  Cape Verde comprises 10 islands whose total land mass is slightly larger than Rhode Island  For more than 500 years  the archipelago that sits about 300 miles off the coast of Senegal was under Portuguese rule  and it was once a key point in the trans Atlantic slave trade Remnants of this colonial past permeate Cape Verde’s present  from the candy colored architecture to the cobblestone streets to the ornate marble pillar where slaves were once shackled in Cidade Velha  the first European outpost in the tropics  And vestiges of the country’s Jewish history remain as well The first wave of Jewish immigrants arrived in the 15th and 16th centuries  when the Inquisition expelled Jews from Spain and Portugal  Some 300 years later  another wave of Sephardic Jews  mostly traders and merchants from Morocco via Gibraltar  immigrated to the Portuguese colony  in search of economic opportunities   Cape Verde would not win independence from Portugal until 1975  Today  several small Jewish cemeteries filled with tombstones bearing Hebrew inscriptions remain throughout the West African island nation  namely in Praia  the capital  and on the islands of Boa Vista and Santo Antão “Cape Verde has a lot of Jewish blood running through its veins ” said Carol Castiel  whose Washington  D C   nonprofit  the Cape Verde Jewish Heritage Project  pays for the restoration of Jewish burial grounds on the archipelago A recently restored cemetery was rededicated in Praia last year and work has begun to restore two cemeteries — Ponta do Sol and Penha de França — in Santo Antão  which Castiel called the capital of Jewish life in Cape Verde “The way you bury your dead is critical in the Jewish community ” said Castiel  who did not attend the Cape Verde Jewish Seder in Roxbury but has in the past While there is no practicing Jewish community in Cape Verde  a largely Catholic country  there are Cape Verdeans descended from Jewish immigrants  Many of them are here in New England  home to about 500 000 people of Cape Verdean ancestry  roughly the same number as in the homeland The Cape Verdean Jewish Passover Seder is a chance for Cape Verdeans to explore their Jewish roots while allowing the Jewish community to learn about Cape Verdean culture and customs  During the recent Seder  which actually happened four days before the eight day holiday began  participants learned the story of two exoduses  the Jewish and the Cape Verdean “The Israelites were fertile and increased in number ” David Gladstone  one of the cochairs of the Seder s planning committee  read from the Haggadah as he began retelling the story of the Jewish exodus  “Pharaoh feared their growing power ”Gladstone told the biblical tale of the pharaoh enslaving the Jews  ordering midwives to kill Jewish firstborn sons  and of Moses escaping that death and being raised by one of the pharaoh’s daughters Then Evandro Carvalho  the Democratic nominee in a special election for state representative for parts of Roxbury and Dorchester  stepped to the microphone  saying  “And Cape Verdeans  or should we say Caboverdeans  tell the story of our journey from slavery and colonialism to freedom and independence  Starting in 1460 u2009  u2009  u2009 ”Carvalho described how slave traders forcibly removed men and women from mainland Africa  making them work on cotton and sugar plantations on Cape Verde  and he spoke of Portugal sending criminals and outlaws to live in the archipelago  where slavery was abolished in 1876 but colonialism continued This was Carvalho’s first Seder but not the first for his cousin  who said their family has Jewish heritage Albertino Carvalho  43  said he was having a conversation with his mother about Cape Verde’s Jewish history after having done a tour of Jewish cemeteries on the archipelago with Joel Schwartz  who happens to be one of the founders of the Cape Verdean Jewish Passover Seder “And then my mother started telling me all these things that I didn’t know ” he said  recalling the decade old conversation  “I came to find out that I had Jewish  ancestors  in the family ”Sixteen year old Aicha Tavares had a similar  yet much more recent  conversation with her mother  who has Jewish ancestors But even before she knew of her family’s heritage and warmed to the idea of attending the Seder  Tavares said she had always been moved by the Jewish people’s story of perseverance “I always went to Catholic schools  and they would make us read the Bible ” the junior at Cristo Rey Boston High School said  “The Old Testament tells way better stories ”This was her third year attending the communal Seder  and now she is cochairwoman of the planning committee Here  she said  there’s a tangible connection to her heritage  both Cape Verdean and Jewish  “My first year  my mom actually dragged me in  as moms do ” she said shortly before taking the stage to ask the four questions of Passover  “Now  I’m choosing to return ”', '2014_719')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('Boston saw its first two homicides of

to police spokesman David Estrada  The victim  who was not named  was pronounced dead at the scene  police said Estrada said the confrontation occurred at about 6 p m  Thursday and the victim and assailant knew each other  The suspect sustained minor injuries in the scuffle and was taken to a local hospital in police custody  Estrada said  The second killing took place in the area of 136 138 Rowe St  in Roslindale at about 11 10 p m   police Superintendent in Chief William Gross  whom Evans promoted earlier in the day  said at the scene  Gross said the victim  an unidentified man  was shot several times on the street and pronounced dead at the scene  He said police did not yet have a description of the suspect  and there was no indication that the shooting was linked to the earlier stabbing  “This is a very quiet area right next to a main thoroughfare ” Gross said of Rowe Street  which is located off of Cummins Highway and is near a community garden  Gross added that officers were canvassing the area and urged anyone with information to contact police  In Hyde Park  a 21 year old woman said she heard part of the exchange that led to the fatal stabbing “It sounded like people were fighting or arguing  and then I got scared and I didn’t hear anything else ” she said Later  she and a friend said  they saw a body covered by a sheet lying in a parking area  with two knives and a patch of blood visible on the pavement  District 5 City Councilor Timothy McCarthy is a lifelong Hyde Park resident who was sworn in to represent the neighborhood and part of Roslindale

television president  with a visual presence like none before him and few since  A half century after his death  however  an estimated 80 percent of Americans have no direct memory of him But the 35th president remains enormously popular  and the Kennedy Library and Museum in Dorchester hopes to bolster and expand that connection through the most ambitious technological makeover since the complex opened in 1979  nHelped by a gift from philanthropist David M  Rubenstein  the museum will expand exhibit space that chronicles Kennedy’s life and legacy with dramatic  new visual offerings and will give visitors more interactive access to documents  speeches  and other papers from his administration The idea is to make the president up close and relevant  partly through an array of large screens  some of them wall to wall and floor to ceiling  that will bring his words and image to the 200 000 people who visit the museum each year The $2 5 million project is expected to be completed by spring 2015 “We know that the new technology can bring the story to life in new and dynamic ways ” said Thomas J  Putnam  director of the library and museum One example of the new  immersive experience will be the exhibit on the televised debate between Kennedy and Richard Nixon during the 1960 presidential campaign  The display now shows that pivotal event on small televisions placed high on a wall at either side of the exhibit  nAfter the makeover  one large screen will take up almost an entire wall  The hope is that visitors will feel they are witnessing the debate  in which Kennedy offered a telegenic  energetic contrast to Nixon “Looking at a little screen  it’s hard to get the impact ” said Heather Campion  chief executive of the John F  Kennedy Library Foundation Another visually inviting display is scheduled for the existing re creation of the Oval Office  where Kennedy’s address to the nation about civil rights in June 1963 is shown on two small monitors  Similar to changes for the debate exhibit  the plan is to replace the monitors with a large screen that will appear to put Kennedy on the scene “To a generation that does not remember President Kennedy  it should be a much more powerful experience ” Campion said Much of that experience will be enhanced by restoration of nearly 500 hours of film in an in kind gift from Deluxe Entertainment Services Group  a Hollywood company that specializes in film preservation Colors are being brightened  clarity is being sharpened  and sometimes grainy footage is being improved to give Kennedy a more immediate and personal presence Film of the president’s inaugural address already has been enhanced  so much so that Kennedy’s breath is more clearly defined as he delivers his short speech on a cold January day in 1961 In addition to film  the project will make more of the collection’s 48 million pages of documents and 400 000 still photographs available to the public through interactive displays that can be easily re shaped to respond to current issues and interests “What you have here now is a traditional library with traditional exhibits ” Campion said  “This will enable us to share the collection in ways that are really unprecedented ”One plan is to display the working drafts of some of Kennedy’s speeches  including his famous inaugural address  The editing shows a man who is concerned about putting emphasis on certain words  about cadence  and about punchy bits of humor Only minor changes are planned for the solemn display about Kennedy’s assassination  in which footage of Walter Cronkite’s emotional broadcast of the president’s death is played in a continuous loop on small screens set against a dark wall  And no changes are planned for the airy  soaring pavilion designed by I M  Pei to be a memorial space When the project is completed  even the acoustics should be improved  “You hear a lot of competing sounds now ” said Campion The last full renovation of the exhibit spaces occurred in 1993 The project is receiving half of its funds from a gift by Rubenstein  the billionaire co founder of The Carlyle Group  a global private equity firm based in Washington  Additional money donated by Rubenstein  chairman of the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington  was used as part of the library’s commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the Kennedy presidency “I got involved in public policy because of him ” said Rubenstein  who was deputy domestic policy adviser to President Jimmy Carter  He recalled watching Kennedy’s inaugural address in sixth grade and how its call to action has resonated with him “The speech is poetry in prose form ” Rubenstein said Rubenstein said he hopes the changes will lure younger people from their computers and experience the museum first hand “I hope that the money will enable the library to be updated and modernized and make it more interactive ” Rubenstein said  “The Kennedy Library is a great resource  and our young people should know about it ”', '2014_244')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article',

Carlos Henriquez  a Dorchester Democrat who had been convicted on two counts of misdemeanor assault in a July 2012 attack on a woman he knew The House voted  146 5  after about an hour and a half of debate that included Henriquez taking the floor to declare his innocence  n“The truth always remains the same  The truth is  I never touched my accuser in any way  at any point in time  that would result in harm or injury ” he said in remarks that lasted about six minutes  “Although a jury found me guilty     it does not change my truth ”Representative David Nangle of Lowell  vice chairman of the House Ethics Committee  speaking first  said Henriquez had violated the House’s code of ethics “He has failed to act prudently  and furthermore his recent criminal conviction indicates an impairment of judgment that is detrimental to the adequate representation of his constituency ” he said “Sometimes as legislators we must act with heavy hearts  but we still must act in the best interests of the constituents of the entire Commonwealth ” he said He also said  “We cannot lose sight that there’s a victim involved ”The House rejected a bid by Representative Russell Holmes to reduce Henriquez’s punishment  That measure would have called for Henriquez’s censure  allowing him to keep his seat  The amendment died on a 143 10 vote Holmes had argued that Henriquez  while in the Middlesex County House of Corrections  had reviewed the rules governing the House  and found that he had not violated any  “He read them ” Holmes said  “You didn’t ”But House leaders argued for the integrity of the institution  insisted that Henriquez’s confinement would prevent him from discharging the duties of his office  and repeatedly urged colleagues to look at photos of the victim’s body  which were available outside the House chamber  The photos  they said  showed multiple black and blue marks on her chest  torso and arms “I was mortified when I saw the pictures ” Nangle said  “I had a sick feeling in my stomach ”No lawmaker had been expelled from the House since 1916  The last state lawmaker forced out of either chamber was Senate Majority Leader Joseph DiCarlo in 1977  During his remarks  Henriquez pointedly did not directly ask lawmakers how to vote  instead telling them  “You may have thought  or think  this could have all been avoided if I resigned  With all due respect  it is my strong belief that an innocent man does not plead  and an innocent man does not quit  Your vote today does not decide my innocence or guilt  It does not determine morality or the truth

Somerville  Carl Sciortino of Medford  and Benjamin Swan of Springfield The expulsion vote capped three weeks of high emotion and drama in the House  Henriquez appeared three times before the Ethics Committee  Each time he was led handcuffed to a State House hearing room  Leading political figures — including Governor Deval Patrick  House Speaker Robert DeLeo  and Boston Mayor Martin J  Walsh — had called on Henriquez to resign  Henriquez’s attorney  Stephanie Soriano Mills  had argued that an all white Middlesex County jury did not constitute a jury of Henriquez’s peers  The NAACP this

authorities suspect killed Evelin Valibayova  nAnd  if they are right  Valibayova was murdered by a monstrous man  a convicted kidnapper paroled in 2006  years earlier than the wishes of the federal judge who sent him away for 75 years  t nValibayova  a native of Azerbaijan  was last seen in mid July 2011  caught on surveillance video as she exited the North Quincy Station on the Red Line  Since then  authorities have said only that they had found forensic evidence in her bedroom — and had a person of interest in the case The Norfolk district attorney’s office  in a court filing this week  for the first time has  identified the chief suspect in her disappearance and apparent murder He’s John D  Castonguay  who in 1986 lured a 9 year old girl walking her puppy in Woonsocket  R I   to a remote area of Blackstone  Mass   where he sexually and physically assaulted her in a gravel pit  leaving her naked and bleeding  tying a rope across her mouth  according to court records When Castonguay was sentenced for the brutal crime in June 1987  US District Court Judge Mark L  Wolf virtually predicted that Castonguay  whom he called “very dangerous as well as very devious ’’  would offend again “The information available to me suggests that if you were back in the community  you would be susceptible          to committing another brutal offense ’’ Wolf told Castonguay  who is now 52  as he sentenced him to 75 years in federal prison   t nIn a court document filed this week in Norfolk Superior Court  authorities essentially said that Wolf’s sentencing remarks were prescient And  for Valibayova  officials believe the consequences were deadly Castonguay “was working as a handyman in her building at the time of her disappearance ’’ the court document states  “he had keys and unfettered access to her apartment  and he admitted to being in her apartment  including cleaning the apartment after her disappearance   Castonguay  remains a suspect in this case ’’Castonguay has not been charged in her disappearance or presumed death Valibayova is described by her family and friends as a bright  ambitious  and multilingual woman  trying to seize her part of the American dream  before she vanished “Beautiful  black eyed  black hair  incredibly charismatic — and very smart ’’ said Duncan Boyd  who was in a relationship with Valibayova when she disappeared  “She would admit to speaking eight languages but I think it was closer to a dozen ’’Boyd said Valibayova told him Castonguay was performing repair work at her Hodges Avenue apartment shortly before her disappearance  “She was uncomfortable being alone there with him ’’ Boyd said  “His presence made her uncomfortable for personal safety reasons  For lack of a better term  she thought he was creepy ’’Valibayova had planned to video chat via Skype with her mother in Azerbaijan the day after she was last seen  But she missed that appointment Boyd became alarmed about Valibayova’s whereabouts after she failed to report for a shift at a Cambridge restaurant  he accompanied Quincy police to Hodges Avenue within days of her disappearance  The apartment was unlocked and most of Valibayova’s possessions  including some important personal documents  were missing Noting that authorities had recovered substantial forensic evidence from her bedroom  Boyd said  “There’s no way she could have lost that much blood and not be admitted to a hospital ’’Boyd said authorities checked local hospitals and found that his girlfriend had not been treated in any of them “Evelin was murdered in her apartment and her body was disappeared ’’ said Boyd Investigators later found some of her belongings  including a brown shoulder bag  her cellphone  wallet  and other papers dumped in a Dorchester neighborhood Without a body  pursuit of a murder indictment against Castonguay is problematic Castonguay was paroled on Aug  30  2006  after serving time for kidnapping  His parole was revoked late last November  nPeter Carr  a spokesman for the criminal division of the Department of Justice  said he could not discuss the rationale for Castonguay’s original release or the circumstances of his reincarceration last year He was arraigned on Thursday in Norfolk Superior Court on new charges relating to violation of his parole  Before that  he had been incarcerated at the federal prison in Fort Dix  N J  He remains in custody Attempts to reach attorneys who have previously represented Castonguay were unsuccessful on Friday News of the identification of a suspect in her disappearance was sobering for close friends who remembered her as a woman whose eyes were fi  firmly on a bright future “It definitely has changed me ’’ said Christian Thornton  who owns a restaurant on Martha’s Vineyard where Valibayova worked  She also worked as a nanny for his two children  “She’s a remarkable young woman ’’ he said  “Her drive  her own investment in her future  and her education was impressive  Just terribly  terribly bright  There’s rarely a day that goes by when I don’t think of her ’’Katie Murashka  whose friendship with Valibayova began when they both worked on Martha’s Vineyard  said her friend dreamed of becoming a successful businesswoman “She had very ambitious plans for herself and her future and she was ready to work for it ’’ Murashka said  “It’s a tragedy that something happened along the way ’’Perhaps the roots of that tragedy can be found in the answer to this question  Why did Castonguay get out so early  Wolf sentenced Castonguay to 75 years  and had set a minimum sentence of 25 Castonguay went to court and successfully challenged it At issue was a federal law on the books at that time that said a prisoner was eligible for parole after serving one third of his term or after serving 10 years of a life sentence or a sentence of more than 30 years Castonguay argued that the federal law required that he become eligible for parole after he had served the lesser of either one third of his sentence or 10 years An appeals court ruled that Wolf “exceeded  his   authority in setting as a minimum sentence  which must be served before parole eligibility could be considered  a term of 25 years  The sentence is vacated ”OK  So the law says this man — this criminal who lured a 9 year old girl into the woods by telling her he knew a great place to pick blueberries — was technically eligible for early release  Fine  But a former federal prosecutor told me that parole authorities now have some explaining to do “It’s pure lunacy to think that a man who kidnaps and rapes a young child deserves to be released early from prison ’’ said Brian T  Kelly  a former assistant US attorney I’m betting that Judge Wolf would not disagree  n•  n•

life They settled into a ragged corner of this tough  working class town in the lowlands of New Hampshire’s Seacoast  Their house’s porch sagged and its dirt driveway turned to rutted mud in rain But here  in the heart of old Seabrook  where people’s struggles were their own and questions weren’t asked  the family believed their secrets were safe and their past had been left behind They tried mightily to start anew  Cheri  the mother  found work as a clerical assistant  Cassie  the eldest  dreamed of a career in art and tried to rein in her brothers Jantzen  Roarke  and Magnus Darriean was too young to remember all that had come before  Eager to please and doe eyed  she was untouched by the pain they had known  Together they tended to her  Together they protected her But behind those eyes  there grew  in the years ahead  a vulnerability and longing  the kind that so easily can lead to darkness  and did  The details may never be fully understood by anyone but Darriean  and perhaps her family  They don’t explain what police say happened  or  certainly  excuse the tragedy  the horror  the grief  the blood  nothing could  But the long  hard meander of her life — both the life she chose and the one others had chosen for her — led her one day last fall to the span over the Hampton River  where police found her sitting in the driver’s seat of a Honda with a spider’s web crack in the windshield  crying hysterically  as a crowd gathered They offered help  but Darriean refused My mother will come  she said  nThe Hesses lived in one of Seabrook’s oldest neighborhoods  on the south side where the maze of roads bear the names of some of the early settlers here — the Fowlers  the Collins  the Browns  Single wides with jerry rigged decks and satellite dishes occupy plots behind worn Victorians and vinyl sided Garrisons Here  the family likely heard the old Seabrook phrasings  “Hark  bub ” a greeting  and “Ike ” an exclamation  The dialect had been preserved for more than a century by the town’s deep insularity  a close knittedness that spurred perceptions of Seabrook as a provincial place  Some outsiders dubbed residents “Brookers ” a slur implying outcasts and lowlifes  Seabrookers responded by using the term for one another  a sort of badge of honor  Brookers were hardy  Brookers were not to be messed with Beyond the neighborhood lies a boggy expanse of cordgrass and salt hay where black backed gulls hover  By night  red lights flare from the nuclear power plant  and past Brown’s Lobster Pound and Over the Border Fireworks  Route 1A threads along the coast  traveling across the Hampton River on the steel and concrete Neil R  Underwood Memorial Bridge  named for a fallen World War II airman  In Hampton  the road becomes the honky tonk spine of Hampton Beach  where  as summer ends  the crowds leave and rents plummet and police know to be on the lookout for fugitives hiding out from warrants In their rented home on Washington Street  the Hesses made for a striking lot  Photographs from the time show the children with strong cheekbones and wide smiles  much like their mother  They were a blended family  Cassie and Jantzen from their mother’s first marriage and Roarke  Magnus  and Darriean from her second Their roots were in Alaska  There  their mother had been raised in the rugged outpost of Haines  where bald eagles outnumber inhabitants in the fall  Cheri followed her father’s path to the sea  working as a deckhand and a gill netter  She’d married and divorced and then married again and moved to Washington state in 1992  But drinking derailed many of her plans  She often blamed her children — there were five now — saying their misbehavior drove her to alcohol  said Roarke  the only family member who would speak to the Globe at length Then  one day  when her second divorce was underway  when they were living outside Seattle and Darriean was still very young  she told her children she was sending them away “Things got pretty intense  and my mother felt it was best that we all go stay with family members for however long it took her to sort things out ” Roarke said What Roarke apparently didn’t know was that authorities had become aware of her alcohol abuse and she had been forced to send the children to live with relatives in Alaska  according to information provided to police and by a family member While her kids were away  she began an online relationship with a man  Robert Fowler  Fowler had deep roots in Seabrook  but perhaps was better known as a vocal defender of his brother Raymond  one of four then teenagers who pleaded guilty to helping kill the husband of Pam Smart  a teacher who had been having an affair with one of them in 1990 Cheri Hess and Fowler made plans to be together  and after winning back custody of the children  Cheri gathered them and took them East to Seabrook  according to the account given to police For the kids  the town  though new and strange  at the opposite end of the country  held a sense of familiarity  They understood Seabrook’s us against the world sensibility “There was a brotherhood feeling ” Roarke recalled Cheri cultivated a hive of activity in the house  placing herself at the center  She adopted a pit bull and snakes  he said  She invited needy acquaintances to stay the night on couches  She took the kids to church after church  trying to find a spiritual home  She was  she would say  relentless in trying to do her best by them “My mother was everything ” Roarke said But while the children saw a devoted advocate in their mother  around town Cheri was known  more than not  as overwhelmed to the point of dysfunction  She was frequently belligerent and quick to pass blame to others for her shortcomings  even as she promised that a new chapter was about to begin  when all would be right Often  Cheri could be found tending her garden  It was  she said  her therapy  nThe calls to police began soon after they settled in town In 1999  Seabrook police visited 80 Washington St  17 times  The next year  they came 12 times  and 15 the year after that  Often they came because Cheri said she needed help controlling her children  They were fighting or had run away  Once  in 2001  police found 7 year old Darriean with severe bruising on her hip and buttocks  They charged Robert Fowler with second degree assault  A year later  he pleaded guilty Just as often  police visited because Cheri was dangerously drunk  Alcohol once again dominated her life  Police records tell of visits to the home when officers found Hess incapacitated  or fighting with Fowler  who told police that their relationship was “wonderful” when she wasn’t drinking In March 2002  police charged her with aggravated drunken driving on Ocean Boulevard in Hampton  She was found guilty  In 2003  she was arrested for endangering the welfare of a child  Court records don’t say which child  or what happened  The case was dropped after Hess agreed to enter an alcohol treatment program Social service agencies and police monitored the household  When questions were asked of the children  they offered guarded answers  “They were very protective of one another ” one law enforcement official recalled  Yet  they were polite and respectful  Remarkably so  given their circumstances  Nice kids  law enforcement officials thought The children worried about saying too much  “Everything was kept behind closed doors as much as we possibly could ” Roarke recalled  There was loyalty demanded by their mother  and also the fear of what could happen if the state stepped in  “We were always horrified that child protective services were going to come and ship us off ”As the chaos unfolded around her  little Darriean’s natural bounciness gave way  She would become stone quiet and impassive  as though  one law enforcement official said  she were shutting down Court records don’t show whether it was Cheri’s decision or the state’s to send 8 year old Darriean away  “I need time to obtain medical care and help I need to recover ” Hess wrote in court papers in 2002 granting temporary custody of Darriean to her aunt and uncle in Alaska  n“We all cried when we had to see her go ” Roarke recalled When Darriean called  she’d ask when she could come home  “We’d tell her  ‘Just a little longer ’ u2009” Roarke said But at home  things were bad  Their mother was hallucinating  She told the children the dog was playing with their PlayStation  Roarke recalled  Then  not long after  she would promise that they were on the cusp of good times  They just had to hang on  nThe children heard her cry The family was at a friend’s house for supper around 2005  and as she walked down stairs  their mother fell and broke her ankle  Roarke said It was the way of things in their family  Roarke said  A new catastrophe beginning as things seemed to be turning up  Cheri’s medical issues  or whatever prompted her to send Darriean away  had abated  and Darriean had returned from Alaska  Cassie was in college  studying graphic design  and had married  Magnus had joined the Marine Corps Junior Reserve Officers Training Corps Then  suddenly  this new crisis Nights filled with Cheri’s screams  Roarke remembers back problems and nerve damage  Doctors prescribed pain medications  By then  she and Fowler had separated  leaving the children to tend to their mother  The children often skipped school for fear of leaving her alone  They cleaned the house and delivered Darriean to school in the morning and helped her with homework after they made dinner  sometimes served at 6 p m   sometimes at 10 p m   as Roarke recalls Friends compared them to a band of fictional orphans who find untapped strength in a parentless void  Some days  they played the part  Other days  the struggle overtook them  One day  around Christmastime  their mother called them into the living room  She had rented a movie  “What’s Eating Gilbert Grape ” the tale of four kids who tend to their morbidly obese  bedridden mother  The mother dies  and the children carry on On June 11  2007  the children found their mother on her knees in the garden  Her face was buried in the dirt  Roarke frantically administered CPR until the ambulance came  He was sure he felt a pulse  They waited for the doctors at Anna Jaques Hospital in Newburyport  And they ventured theories  Perhaps their mother had dozed off  fallen forward  and suffocated in the loamy soil The toxicologist’s report traced Cheri Hess’s death at 48  to an overdose  Roarke said  nThe funeral was well attended  Friends delivered aluminum wrapped dinners to the house  Relatives palmed checks into their hands  Townspeople held a fund raiser at the American Legion Decisions had to be made  Magnus was 17  Darriean 13  Someone would have to look after them “I wouldn’t have it any other way ” Cassie told the local newspaper at the time of her decision to leave the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn and take custody of Darriean and Magnus in Seabrook But as relatives departed and checks stopped arriving  the upwelling of confidence ebbed  They were back where they had started  only now  without their mother  Darkness had descended  again “We’d been fighting for so long to make things better  to get things right ” Roarke said  “All that fight  for nothing ”Money ran short  he said  Their dogs went hungry and were given away  Magnus acted out in high school  Roarke dropped out  Cassie divorced  Rent payments became onerous  and they had to move  The boys went their separate ways  Magnus into the National Guard and Roarke and Jantzen into road work  Cassie and Darriean moved to New York  then back to New Hampshire  Cassie gave birth to a daughter  She and the father quarreled  At least two altercations ended with police intervention  one fight  in 2012  resulted in a day long jail stay for Cassie  court and jail records show By the time she was 16  Darriean had grown to 5 foot 6  She was slender with long chestnut hair  She’d gone through a Goth period  Her new thing was skipping classes at Winnacunnet High School  She appeared headed for trouble  and was placed in residential home for girls in northern New Hampshire  Roarke said She didn’t stay long  In March 2011  she and a friend hitched a ride to Boston where they ended up at a man’s apartment in Dorchester  The man had a lengthy criminal history  mostly for drug dealing  court records show Boston police took up a frantic search for the girls after Darriean’s friend called her family seeking help  Using the GPS coordinates of the cellphone  police stormed the house and found Darriean in the apartment  Police charged the man with rape of a child  kidnapping  inducing a minor to prostitution  and holding a house of ill repute  He pleaded not guilty  nYet  six months later  the charges had been dropped  court records show  The Suffolk County district attorney’s office said that the girls declined to talk with prosecutors Darriean returned to New Hampshire  Then she left again  An Alaskan court record shows that in July 2011  Melanie Hess of Haines  her paternal grandmother  was appointed her guardian  nSmall  isolated  and skirted by the snow capped Chilkat Range  Haines clings to the edge of a jade blue inlet  Adventure seekers raft and hike  and cruise ships deposit tourists in the town center to browse art galleries  Come winter  a blue cold encrusts Main Street and daylight dwindles to a six hour pinhole For Darriean  Haines was something like an ancestral home  There  Darriean’s mother had been a chatty girl who rode a banana seat bike  read horror novels  and was left to cope with her own mother’s depression when her father was out on commercial fishing junkets  Cheri’s first marriage to a high school classmate ended here  and she’d met Darriean’s father  Darrin Hess  at a wedding Perhaps these ghosts of her past walked alongside her as she went to school  to the store  back to her grandmother’s house  One minute she was withdrawn and the next arrogant  telling tall tales about her fancy house in Seabrook and the fancy clothes in her closet there  The whole East Coast  she told friends  was superior to Haines She soon ditched her grandmother’s house  sleeping on the couch of whatever friend would take her  Along the way  she alienated a number of them  One accused her of borrowing hundreds of dollars in belongings and never returning them  Another said she drove her car without permission  Darriean declined comment on the allegations  and other matters  through her lawyer She moved in with a boyfriend  but fought with him  Often  she was distraught  “She just wanted somebody to take care of her  finally ” Michael Ward  a childhood friend  recalled her saying  He also said she confessed to him a bad drug problem and that she had hoped finally in Alaska to get clean  But she sought out Adderall  a stimulant prescribed to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder  and snorted the opiate Vicodin  said a friend who asked not to be named  nSome sensed fragility in her  “She was a real nice girl  A bit standoffish ” said Jack Smith  whose wife gave her a job at White Rock Nursery in Haines  But that made sense  he said  “I’d heard things about her father ”Darriean had never known her father  but she knew about him “There were some pretty embarrassing things that she was upset about forever ” Ward said She didn’t talk about the details She didn’t need to  He knew them  Like just about everyone in Haines  nWhen Darriean was an infant  her father was a king crab fisherman  The job was legendarily dangerous  but it brought in good money  When he returned after months at sea to their home outside Seattle  he came bearing gifts  Cowboy boots after one trip  a race track with electric cars after another  Then his drinking would begin and violence would swallow the house “He’s given everyone but my baby sister bruises ” Cassie would write in a letter to court officials There was more  On a summer afternoon in 1994  10 year old Cassie came to her mother  She had something to tell her  a secret she had kept for fear of what her stepfather  Darrin Hess  would do if she told  He plied Cassie with beer  Cheri wrote in a letter to the court  When the other children were around  he would send them away and tell her  “I want you ” Cassie told police  according to a prosecutor’s affidavit The sexual abuse started in Alaska and continued after the family moved to Washington state in 1992  the affidavit states  The one time Cassie forcefully resisted  Cassie wrote in her letter  he gave her two black eyes  “I made up a reason for the black eyes ” she wrote Darriean’s father confessed to the abuse  but said it was not as extensive as Cassie alleged  He pleaded guilty to three counts of rape of a child in the first degree  A judge sentenced him to 16 years at the state penitentiary in Walla Walla In a letter to the judge  Darriean’s father offered no apology and lamented that the abuse had “ruined my life ” “I am empty and don’t even have a future any more ” he wrote Cheri  in her letter  wrote that Cassie had come forward because she didn’t want Darriean to endure what she had suffered A permanent restraining order went into effect  Darriean’s father was not to have contact with any of the children  ever  according to their divorce decree Even so  around the time Darrin Hess became a free man in June 2012 — his probation had ended and he was allowed to travel outside Washington state — Darriean was making plans Soon  she was on a plane out of Alaska She gave no notice at the White Rock Nursery  nA waning moon hung over the marsh of New Hampshire’s Seacoast as Darriean raced over the bridge leading to Hampton Beach shortly before 1 a m  on Sept  21  the last day of summer She had been back in New Hampshire for about a year  and of late  living with Roarke  who had persuaded his girlfriend to let her stay with them in Seabrook  He wanted to keep a close eye on her  She needed it  he sensed She was running around with a new guy  They were engaged  The two worked at a sports warehouse  and liked to go out driving  he at the wheel  cruising fast  She would tell him to slow down  but he knew it was false protest  “The cop said he was doing 80 and we flew by him doing like 100  laughing my a   off  ” she wrote on her Facebook page after the couple was pulled over in January 2013  according to an account published by the news site Seacoastonline com  nOn that early September morning  she was alone  driving her fiance’s Honda Civic up Ocean Boulevard when police lights flashed  The officer clocked her doing 59 in a 30 mile per hour zone  When he asked for her driver’s license  she said she didn’t have it with her  Then  she told him she didn’t have one  She never had  according to police reports  She would be summoned to court for the violations  the officer told her  For now  she could have someone retrieve the car Darriean didn’t call her brothers or Cassie  She didn’t call her fiance  Police say she got in touch with 48 year old Cindy Sheppard  nSheppard’s customers knew her as “Cinderella ” She could score you heroin  or “browns ” or “benzos ” as in benzodiazepines  antianxiety medications  according to court records  Four months earlier  in May  Hampton police had staked out her apartment and charged Sheppard with selling heroin  crack cocaine  oxycodone  and other drugs She was out on bail  awaiting trial  and that night  she was available  She lived only a few blocks from where Darriean had been stopped  When she arrived  Sheppard was given the car keys  Darriean and Sheppard returned to Sheppard’s apartment  and as the bars emptied and the crowds ate blooming onions and pizza slices  police allege that Sheppard supplied Darriean with fentanyl  a painkiller much more potent than morphine Around 8 a m   the day’s sunlight sharp and brilliant  Sheppard returned the keys to Darriean  and soon  police say  she was speeding back toward the bridge Darriean would have passed a parked police cruiser with lights flashing and 4 foot high  A framed signs announcing a bike race that day  As the Honda crested and zoomed onto the steel grating of the drawbridge’s lift  she would have felt a jolt  and then  as she barreled down the slope  the cottages and bungalows of Seabrook beach would have come into view  She also could have seen  at the base of the bridge  a line of bikers in jerseys  hugging the side of the road  nPam Wells was pedaling a Bianchi  She’d bought the high end bicycle at the urging of Margo Heigh  a 54 year old dental hygienist who took spinning classes with her at the Beverly YMCA  The two had trained together with Margo’s friend  Elise Bouchard  for months for rides like this one  the Granite State Wheelmen Seacoast Century  a noncompetitive traverse of the coastal roads of Massachusetts  New Hampshire  and Maine For Wells  the 60 year old controller of the Boston Symphony Orchestra  wife  and mother of two teens  bicycling had become a keen interest in recent years  adding to gardening  cooking  and piano playing  her college major  As Wells and Heigh  along with Bouchard  a 52 year old customer service manager  and her boss  Uwe Uhmeyer  60  of Essex  set off that morning  they were ebullient  “We’re so lucky ” Bouchard mused Nearing 8 30 a m   the foursome rode north  past the wind bent grasses of Seabrook’s marsh  toward the Underwood Bridge A retired New Hampshire State Police major  David Kelley  was driving behind them  Ahead  he saw a car on the bridge  Kelley told authorities  It was moving so fast he expected to see police in pursuit  But none came  and the car kept coming  crossing the double yellow line and veering into the northbound lane  then plunging into the line of bicyclists Jim Schofield  a school bus painter from Manchester  N H   who had been bicycling a short distance behind the foursome  saw things fly into the air  To his left  he saw the Honda cross back into the southbound lane  tear through a steel cable and crash through a sign that read “Welcome to Seabrook Beach ”It happened so fast that Schofield didn’t realize anyone had been hit  He ran to the Honda  and joined Kelley in wrenching open its driver’s door  Schofield noticed Darriean was holding an iPhone  Its screen was smashed  She was crying  She told the men she had glass in her eyes and her mouth  The men told her an ambulance was coming “Do I f     look like I need an ambulance ” she asked The men assured her she did “My mom is coming to get me ” she said The men insisted she stay put  and she grew more upset  “I only took my eyes off the road for a second ” she said Schofield’s mind was turning over the scene  The things he’d seen flying in the air  he realized  were bodies As bicyclists tended the injured  others were vomiting as they came upon the gruesome scene Uhmeyer and Heigh had suffered multiple fractures  Wells and Bouchard’s injuries were grievous and fatal  Their spinal cords were crushed  their hearts and lungs lacerated  nTom Rogers is Pam Wells’s widower  He lives in Hamilton with their two teenage children  Alex and Elise  He is a freelance Web designer  He and Wells had been married for 19 years His focus now is helping his children to heal  Alex is applying to college this year  Elise is a high school junior with plans to become a doctor  He follows Darriean’s criminal case  The drip drip of news  The allegations that Darriean had taken fentanyl before the crash  the allegations that she also was high on Klonopin and Percocet Rogers is hoping for a plea bargain  Thirty seven years ago  his brother’s fiancee was killed by a drunk driver on Massachusetts Avenue in Cambridge  The trial was lengthy and beyond painful “I don’t want my children to see any of that ” he said What he wishes for Darriean is more complicated “I would like to see her come out of this a better person ” he said Jail  he believes  isn’t likely to produce such a result  “People say I’m being soft  but I’m not sure justice would be served ”And yet  he can’t abide her going free “Her messed up life has messed up my life and other families’ lives  and now we’re all damaged goods ”Darriean is out on bail  charged with driving while intoxicated — negligent homicide  negligent homicide  second degree assault  and manslaughter  and she is living under house arrest  Roarke said she’s staying with their mother’s former boyfriend  Robert Fowler  near her childhood home in Seabrook  her broken path come full circle  But she wasn’t there on a recent day  She wasn’t with Cindy Sheppard  either  Sheppard’s apartment was vacant  only a lace curtain remained in the door window  At the end of January a judge sentenced Sheppard to three to six years in prison for dealing drugs  She is awaiting trial on charges of supplying Darriean with fentanyl and allowing Darriean  whom she knew to be unlicensed  to drive the Honda In another Hampton Beach apartment  Cassie answered the door  Her eyes were bloodshot and half open  She leaned against the door frame  She wanted to talk about Darriean  But she couldn’t  Darriean’s lawyer’s orders  “It’s all so wrong ” she said  before closing the door  “So

 But my smartphone’s green glow let me know I had just invested $5 in the world’s most controversial  questionable  and exciting new currency  the bitcoin The machine  which is the first of its kind in Boston  was officially plugged in Wednesday morning — right next to Pinkberry — and began spewing bitcoins  virtually “You can think of it as Internet cash ” said Chris Yim  cofounder of   the Boston company that operates the new bitcoin ATM  “This is just a more secure way of buying things online ”It is also confusing to many people  That’s why a Google search turns up such posts as  “How to explain bitcoin to your grandmother ” and  “What the heck is a bitcoin ”The five year old currency is not backed by any central government  but can be spent just like dollars in a small but increasing number of places  including some local restaurants and the popular online retailer Overstock com  nBitcoins are stored by users in so called digital wallets  and each coin has a unique online address  Transactions are managed by thousands of computers linked in a worldwide network  helping to ensure their integrity There is also the benefit of privacy  While purchases are shared with the entire network  creating a permanent record  users don’t have to personally identify themselves — the same way someone handing over cash at a register doesn’t have to provide the clerk with a name  The hackers who stole millions of credit card numbers from Target during the holiday season would have a much tougher time cracking the bitcoin code Bitcoin’s promise of anonymity has proved attractive to criminals  It was the favorite currency of the now defunct outlaw website Silk Road  a global trading post for illegal drugs and worse  But now much of the bitcoin action comes from legitimate — and greedy — financial speculators  They have helped drive the value of a single bitcoin from a few dollars in 2011 nto as high as $1 242 in November  Since then  it has plummeted  and as of Wednesday the price was about $630   nBuying bitcoin through a bank can take several days  But Liberty Teller’s ATM  developed by a Manchester  N H   company called   will quickly sell up to $500 worth at a time  A Liberty Teller competitor  Robocoin  is planning to launch machines soon in Austin  Texas  and has one in Vancouver  British Columbia Liberty Teller nplans to install and operate more of the machines Unlike an explanation of the bitcoin  the directions for the new ATM are simple  I used an Android app called Mycelium to get my small fraction of one coin  It displays a barcode containing a unique digital signature that identified my bitcoin account  You press the barcode against a scanner on the front of the ATM  which reads the digital code to determine where to send the bitcoin  Next  feed in cash  press the touchscreen  and the deal is done  It takes the global bitcoin network about 10 minutes to confirm the transaction Unfortunately  your new currency may be worth less than you thought  thanks to the rapidly shifting value of bitcoin  Last week I spent $100  nfor 144 millibits  Ten minutes later it was worth only $97 61  nBitcoin has freaked out many a bureaucrat  It’s banned in Russia and Chinese banks are barred from accepting it  for instance  But US government officials have been pleasantly open minded  Companies that agree to standard federal financial regulations are free to deal in bitcoin  Which is why I could walk into South Station and give Liberty Teller my money On Wednesday  Davis Foster  an electrical engineer from Wellesley  was an early adopter of the new device  But he’s also a bitcoin veteran “Previously  I’ve bought anywhere from a couple of dollars to a couple of hundred dollars ” said Foster  who spent $20 at the ATM and considers the virtual currency an investment Another passerby  Jay Kelly of Dorchester  committed an entire dollar to Bitcoin  then broadcast his digital code over Twitter so anybody could cash in  Kelly  who called himself an “information activist ” said he loves the idea of a free flowing digital currency “If you can send a dollar” over the Internet  he said  “you can send a million ”And you can do it cheaply  It costs my wife $12 to send $100 to a relative in the Democratic Republic of Congo  via Western Union  An equivalent bitcoin transaction would cost next to nothing  Sending money between nations is a $500 billion global business  enough to make bitcoin a major success  even if it were used for nothing else But most consumers aren’t ready for bitcoin  They’re frightened by a currency whose value can fluctuate wildly from hour to hour  Besides  what can they buy with it  Few retailers accept bitcoins  even though they could save a fortune on credit and debit card fees and offer customers greater security South Station’s ATM will certainly thrill passing geeks  but it’s the nearby merchants who will really decide the fate of virtual money  When I can spend my freshly purchased bitcoins at the yogurt stand next door  I’ll become a true believer', '2014_223')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article',

which  I suppose  is a job requirement for a man of the cloth Even so  talking may be a bad idea for a man who has been accused of taking part in an alleged Keystone Kops style shakedown attempt — in this case of Keolis  the French company that recently won a $2 4 billion contract to run the commuter rail system  nWall’s name is the lone one that appears on the dubious $105 000 “invoice” presented to a Keolis official last month by Rev  Eugene F  Rivers 3d on behalf of a company calling itself DRM Advisory Group   DRM stands for Dorchester  Roxbury  and Mattapan  According to the Keolis official  Rivers warned her that he could cause a lot of headaches for Keolis if it didn’t make the $105 000 payment to DRM  Rivers publicly denies he made such threats and has since stopped discussing the matter The crux of all this is that a group of ministers and activists held two meetings with Keolis officials about ensuring that the company would employ a diverse workforce after it takes over the commuter rail on July 1 The ministers became concerned that Keolis was not taking them seriously  and was not committed to dealing with them  Somehow — as Wall initially explained it — sending a bill for services unrendered was supposed to bring the company back to the bargaining table  Keolis  for its part  said it had never agreed to pay DRM anything for its advice on diversity Now  two weeks after saying he was confused about the invoice that carried his name  Wall has shifted gears  scheduling a community meeting for Thursday night  He is upset about coverage of the issue  which began with a column in this space  He calls that column an attempt to “create a newspaper selling  quasi sensational story  and embarrass the black community ” nAs he prepares to tell his side of the story  there are a few questions I would be eager to hear him answer  nFor example  while Wall has admitted that the group sent the invoice  he has since said that DRM never actually expected to be paid  Why send it then Also  Wall has said  “This was not an attempt to shake down Keolis  it was meant to shake up Keolis ” What  in this instance  is the difference Then there is the matter of the shadowy figure who left a message on a Keolis website blasting the company and its principal Boston lobbyist  Mike McCormack  for racism  McCormack is the person who advised Keolis not to pay the $105 000 to DRM  The messenger who labeled McCormack racist — a ridiculous allegation  by the way — identified himself as Shabazz Muhammad The fact that a Shabazz Muhammad is not known in the black activist community raised new questions  So did the fact that the e mail address the messenger used belongs to an activist by the name of Leonard Lee — the person that DRM wanted Keolis to hire as its diversity specialist  Whether Shabazz Muhammad really exists is not clear — but Lee denies sending the message under that name All of which points up just how tangled and unfortunate the whole sad DRM invoice matter has become  It has left many dedicated people in the black community shaking their heads in confusion  disappointment — and embarrassment Wall says he wants to reclaim his reputation  He has  in fact  been a force for good over the years  His involvement in this sordid affair may be less about his character than his common sense — or  in this case  his failure to listen to his gut when he allowed his name to be put on the invoice  In his zeal to be viewed as a major player  he may have been a dupe But his possible naivete doesn’t address the most important question  the one many in the black community are most eager to have answered  How was challenging Keolis this way going to do anything for the community they profess to love', '2014_1129')","('no article',

dollar employer  won local and national sympathy for their struggle  and stayed united In one of the highest profile worker movements in years — and in one of the most union friendly states in the country — organized labor is on the sidelines  n t nThe job actions at Market Basket demonstrate the power and voice that employees can have when they unite for a cause  but the high profile drama is a highly unusual case in labor relations  specialists said  It may be difficult  they add  to draw many conclusions for other workers across the country who are struggling for better wages  working conditions  and benefits “It’s a very  very special case ” said Ron Seeber  a Cornell University professor of industrial and labor relations  “It’s hard to imagine this happening in many other settings ”Analysts also note Market Basket employees have not achieved their central demand  the restoration of their ousted boss  Arthur T  Demoulas  as president of the company As the walkout stretches into its fourth week  the financial risks and pressures on workers and the broader movement only intensify The decision last week to cut back hours for part time employees — and consequently  their paychecks — could open fissures between part timers and their more senior full time co workers  t nMarket Basket workers have mostly emptied the stores of groceries and customers  held massive rallies in support of the former president  and garnered national attention with stories in The New York Times  on CBS News  and even in Esquire magazine  which called the protest movement the “last stand for the middle class ”Many of the workers have said they fear that without Arthur T  at helm  their decent wages and good benefits will disappear This job action is not about management demands to roll back wages  eliminate traditional pensions in favor of 401 k  plans  or cut health benefits — issues that can divide employees with different ages and pay tiers There is a single focus  restoring Arthur T  as head of the company  He was dismissed in late June by the company’s board  which is controlled by his archrival and cousin  Arthur S  Demoulas “There’s no division about what they want ” said Peter Derouen  a spokesman for the United Food and Commercial Workers  Local 791  a union that represents workers at Shaw’s Supermarkets Inc  “This is a one issue fight ”The fight also has involved nearly the entire 25 000 person workforce  from cashiers to store managers Usually  when front line workers walk out in protest  mid level managers take over  doing the work and buffering the company’s bottom line from potential financial losses But in the Market Basket fight  the company’s managers — from high level supervisors to directors and department heads at individual stores — have been a key force in the protest movement  They have helped organize the rallies and demonstrations  encouraged customer boycotts  and supported lower level workers Nelson Lichtenstein  director of the Center of the Study of Work  Labor and Democracy at the University of California Santa Barbara  pointed out that national labor law bars managers from participating in unions “Here you have an example of the advantages of not being within the law ” Lichtenstein said “This is clarifying  If you’re really going to have a revival of the labor movement in America  all these phony distinctions about who is a manager and who is a worker         have to be cast aside ”A more conventional labor protest took place at a Market Basket competitor  Shaw’s  in 2010  when unionized warehouse workers struck for four months over pay and health benefits  The result was much less damaging to Shaw’s That chain’s managers hired replacement workers and were able to keep the stores open for customers As the cost to families and finances mounted  some striking Shaw’s employees crossed the picket lines  Ultimately  the union settled for a deal that was comparable to the one it had rejected earlier A 2012 strike at Caterpillar Inc  had similar results  Union machinists at an Illinois plant walked off the job after the company demanded a wage freeze and benefit cuts  despite the heavy equipment maker’s strong profits  Less than four months later  they returned to work and agreed to most of the company’s demands “Over the few past decades  when we’ve seen workers resist         the workers have lost ” said Jake Rosenfeld  a sociology professor at the University of Washington and the author of “What Unions No Longer Do ”Nationally  the number of strikes has plummeted  from 317 in 1973 to just 15 last year  according to the US Department of Labor If the Market Basket action succeeds  it may offer worker movements a sliver of hope after a series of defeats  Rosenfeld said “The situation seems to be unprecedented ” he said  “It’s still very early ” he said  noting that union actions can go on for months But now a downside to the revolt has emerged  Thousands of Market Basket workers are not going to be paid this week  because their hours have been cut to zero since there is so little business at the stores The brunt has been felt by the company’s part time employees  who make up a majority of its workforce  Meanwhile  store managers and their assistants are still at work and are being paid The longer a standoff lasts  the harder it can be on workers who are going without a paycheck  said Paul Feeney  a spokesman for the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers  Local 2222  in Dorchester In 2011  members of the electrical workers union went on strike against Verizon Communications Inc  But they went back to work after two weeks and returned to the negotiating table  eventually preserving some pay and benefits when a new contract was finalized more than a year later When strikes stretch on  unions may help with funds to aid workers with family and living expenses  but the amounts are usually a fraction of the regular paychecks Market Basket organizers have set up a fund raising site that asks workers who are being paid to help support warehouse workers and truck drivers who walked off the job and prevented deliveries of fresh food to the stores  leaving shelves mostly empty The fund has raised more than $91 000 Audra Makuch  assistant to the regional director for the United Food and Commercial Workers union  said her organization has received phone calls from part time Market Basket workers who are increasingly concerned they will lose out in this family feud “They’ve done amazing work bringing the company to their knees ” Makuch said  “but as people lose their hours  people are getting scared ” nFeeney  from the electrical workers union  said the Market Basket saga puts companies on notice that employees still have some leverage Verizon workers  he added  will soon start renegotiating their contract  “Hopefully ” he said  “we’ll use that momentum ”', '2014_591')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no

to start would be a second innovation district  located not on the expensive waterfront  but in Dudley Square  Boston should not be ashamed of its inequality  When cities offer good social services  welcoming ethnic enclaves  and public transportation  they attract people of limited means  Boston also appeals to the rich  some of whom gain from the city’s free flow of knowledge  and some of whom just like shopping on Newbury Street  It’s the suburbs  which are superficially more equal because land use controls zone out poverty  that should be embarrassed  But Boston’s inequality still demands some policy response  Earlier this month  I facilitated a town hall meeting on economic development in Roxbury  and an initiative to revitalize Dudley Square was a crowd favorite  This could take many forms  the most promising would be to emulate Mayor Menino’s Innovation District  nin this lower income but more affordable locale  A Dudley Square “entrepreneurship district” should try to appeal not only to technology startups  but also to a wider range of entrepreneurs  food trucksters as well as educational software designers  Dudley Square is not rich  but it has promise  The median household in its zip code earns $27 000  but it is only a 15 minute walk from Northeastern University  Dudley serves as a high volume bus hub  and the Orange Line and commuter rail are short walks away  It has plenty of space for development  While Boston is marked by its large employers  only one of the 388 business establishments in Dudley Square’s zip code has more than 250 employees  Dudley Square will also be the home for the new Boston Public Schools headquarters but  to thrive as a neighborhood  An entrepreneurship district could lure that investment by reducing the barriers to opening new businesses  The Dudley Square district should  like   get one stop permitting with guaranteed decision times  State legislation and local ordinances would be needed  but the advantages of encouraging startups in a less advantaged area should be obvious to all  Neighborhoods rich and poor in Massachusetts have a history of using the extensive state and local permitting processes to hold up or head off new commercial development  for the entrepreneurship district to work  the Dudley Square community would need to accept fast track construction permitting as the price of bringing in new economic activity Boston should be wary of following one of the more common economic development practices   nbribing businesses with tax breaks to locate in particular areas  This approach is often wasteful  a firm can claim its tax breaks for building in certain target areas  even if it would have located somewhere nearby without the incentive  A good entrepreneurship district should pioneer policies that don’t drain public coffers and can easily be exported elsewhere if successful New business clusters emerge because of the intrinsic advantages that exist in and around a neighborhood  close proximity to the school system headquarters  for instance  could prove helpful for technology startups interested in developing and promoting educational software that frees teachers up to do more one on one instruction  nA Dudley Square district would need to foster strong connections between emerging employers and  nthe area’s many educational institutions  such as Roxbury Community College  With help from nonprofits   nlocal high schools could create pathways to new local businesses  There is still a role for hands on political leadership  The area will need a prominent tech sharing space  similar to the space that startup accelerator MassChallenge has in the existing Innovation District  Mayor elect Martin Walsh needs to find the right partners and the right space to make this happen

battle to her home state of Connecticut  in an apparent move to extricate itself from a drama in which the parents allege they have been unfairly stripped of their rights to make medical choices for their daughter The Department of Children and Families said it is also endorsing a plan to have Justina Pelletier’s medical care transferred back to Tufts Medical Center  which has long been a demand of her parents  Their attempt to move their daughter’s care a year ago from Boston Children’s Hospital to Tufts  where she had been treated previously  is what set in motion the events that led them to lose custody of the teenager As recently as Monday   to have Pelletier  15  moved to foster care in Merrimac and her medical care moved to UMass Memorial Medical Center in Worcester  “Our primary goal has always been the health and well being of Justina ” said spokesman Alec Loftus  in the children’s agency’s first public comments on a case drawing national attention  “We want the parents to be able to work with the providers and courts to ultimately move Justina back to her home state of Connecticut ”The agency has also backed off its push to have the girl’s father held in contempt for speaking publicly about the case in violation of a juvenile judge’s gag order  Loftus said — in remarks that themselves may have defied the gag order  Loftus said it was dropping the gag order complaint against Lou Pelletier But the potentially promising overture may yet lead nowhere — as has happened repeatedly  Justina’s father  reached by phone Friday morning on his way to a weekly visit with Justina at a Department of Children and Families office in Roxbury  initially reacted positively  though guardedly  when a Globe reporter told him about the agency’s announcement  Lou Pelletier said it was “a step in the right direction” but he needed to see concrete results Within a few hours  though  he was part of an angry public outburst against the agency  after he and his wife were initially denied their visit with their daughter  State officials  apparently motivated in part by spotting Fox News television cameras outside  put off the meeting Just when the teenager might move back to her home state has not been decided  nor is it known where she will live — whether at home in West Hartford  in a foster care placement  or at a residential facility  Gary Kleeblatt  spokesman for the child protection agency in Connecticut  acknowledged that it had received a request from Massachusetts to “assess a resource in Connecticut for possible placement of Justina ” He said the state “is working with the Pelletier family to identify services they may need going forward ”Several sources who have been involved in the case say many factors likely affected the Department of Children and Families’ decision to shift course  They include pressure from the national attention the case has generated and a petition circulating in the state Legislature  an acknowledgment that Justina’s condition has not improved to the degree that doctors and state officials had expected  and a determination by Massachusetts child protection officials and the juvenile court judge to force their counterparts in Connecticut to step up their involvement These sources said Judge Joseph Johnston has said he wants to see Justina’s case transferred to Connecticut  n“The judge has provided a path out of this conundrum  and DCF  having hit a wall  is taking advantage of the opportunity ” said one of the sources briefed on the case Gail Garinger  who heads the Office of the Child Advocate  which is a watchdog over DCF  said she was heartened by Friday’s announcement  “This is the best shot at getting everyone to work together and focus on Justina’s treatment and reunification ” Garinger said If Massachusetts officials had hoped to attract some good will from Justina’s parents based on Friday’s news  it did not seem to last long After the parents’ meeting with Justina was abruptly postponed  the Rev  Patrick Mahoney  head of the Washington based Christian Defense Coalition  who says he represents the family  scheduled a news conference to air the Pelletiers’ grievances over the nearly canceled visit  He insisted that the child protection agency’s actions were grossly unfair  and that the parents had nothing to do with drawing the news cameras to the meeting  which was ultimately held later in the day “The Pelletiers didn’t invite them ” said Mahoney  whose group is one of several conservative Christian groups backing the Pelletiers Mahoney said that despite the agency’s announcement  his group is going ahead with a “Free Justina” vigil on Saturday outside the Framingham residential facility where the girl has lived for the past month  after spending nearly a year at Children’s Hospital The Pelletiers’ frequent sparring with clinicians over the years in Massachusetts and Connecticut — and their willingness to go public so often about their daughter’s situation — has been an ongoing concern for the courts and the Department of Children and Families  Such parental behavior can be at the heart of complaints of medical child abuse — a controversial  new term that was applied to the Pelletiers  These allegations refer to parents or caregivers seeking unnecessary and potentially harmful medical interventions for children A two part in December about the Pelletier case  one of a handful of complex medical child abuse cases at Children’s in the past two years  showed that Justina’s parents had been questioned over the quality of their care for her  including pushing for invasive procedures and ignoring mental health issues After hearing extensive testimony  the juvenile court judge found earlier this year that the parents were unfit to handle many of Justina’s complex problems  say two sources briefed on the closed door hearings  Also in the past two months  these sources say  the child welfare agency in Connecticut  responding to a medical child abuse complaint filed last year  opened a case after finding sufficient reason for concern Justina’s parents have long rejected the suggestion they are unfit parents drawn to seek attention  saying they go to the media only as a last resort to seek help for the grave injustice their family has endured The parents insist their daughter’s chronic gastrointestinal problems and immobility in her legs relate to a rare metabolic illness  called mitochondrial disorder  for which she had been treated by Tufts physicians for a year  However  staff at Children’s  where Justina was brought last February after she almost stopped eating and walking  concluded after a few days that the girl’s symptoms were largely psychiatric in origin and announced plans to change her treatment plan When the parents rejected the psychiatric diagnosis and threatened to remove Justina from Children’s  staff filed medical child abuse allegations with the state  The parents asked for the girl’s Tufts metabolic specialist  Dr  Mark Korson  to be included in discussions about Justina’s care  However  Children’s and child protection officials did little to involve Korson  As the months passed  the parents’ relationship with the state agency and Children’s grew only more contentious In addition to just when and where Justina will be moved  another looming issue is who will pay  Massachusetts or Connecticut  once she is moved  MassHealth  the state’s Medicaid insurance for the poor  typically pays for medical expenses for children in the custody of the state  But two sources briefed on the case say it remains unclear whether Connecticut’s Medicaid program will pay for Justina’s care if she returns to her home state The next juvenile court hearing on Pelletier’s case is March 17',

company called Videll Healthcare  a Seattle outfit that was running four nursing homes in Massachusetts  including Park Place  a sweet little gem of a facility in Hyde Park  nShortly after taking over Park Place in late 2012  Videll seemed determined to run it into the ground  The company had serious cash flow problems from the start and failed to pay a bunch of bills  Trash piled up  phones went down  food deliveries stopped  and staff had to use their own money to buy basics for patients  such as milk  Longtime staffers quit or were driven away  The medical director resigned  The state froze admissions At the time  Videll chief executive Steve LaForte cited late reimbursements from Veterans Affairs as an explanation for the facility’s problems  The many e mails I got after the column ran suggested the problems were deep  They asserted that Videll  which had also recently taken over facilities in Western Massachusetts and in other states  failed to pay bills  which endangered patients  and that the company brushed aside the concerns of worried employees In March  Griffin American Healthcare  the California real estate investment trust that owns Park Place  booted Videll out of its four Massachusetts properties  Executives at Griffin knew there were problems at Park Place  but they had not realized how bad things had become  Griffin installed BaneCare  a well regarded local firm  to take over Park Place and the other three facilities  The California firm filed a lawsuit against Videll I can generally be relied upon to rail against corporations looking to make massive profits in industries that care for the most vulnerable among us  But Griffin did the right thing here  and they did it fast  without any pushing from the state It’s a new day in Hyde Park  n“Everything just feels better ” says Polly Walker  whose 91 year old mother  Cecile  is a resident at Park Place  “Bane seems to be doing a very good job  They’re much more forthcoming and open  It’s a very good crew ”Chief executive Richard Bane says the state has lifted its freeze on patient admissions  and the home now has new  professional administrators  With more cash from Griffin  it’s regaining its former strength “We’re not out of the woods yet ” he says  “But we’re certainly a success story in the making ”Elsewhere  residents in Videll homes are still struggling mightily  Last Wednesday  the state took over Laurel Center  a Videll facility in Bedford  N H  There  too  state officials had been receiving complaints for more than a year  mostly over unpaid bills “I think they were just moving money around from facility to facility ” says John Martin  manager of health licensing and certification in New Hampshire  “The problem appeared to be economic viability  The quality of care has been consistently good ”They can’t say the same in Minneapolis  where the state removed Videll from Camden Care and Rehabilitation Center last Friday  There  inspectors found that residents were in immediate jeopardy  In court documents  they cited a whopping 47 violations of federal regulations that could cause “serious injury  harm  impairment  or death to a resident ”Yikes The chief financial officer of Sabra Health Care  the real estate investment trust that leased the Camden Center and another facility in Duffield  Va   to Videll  said the trust is reassessing its relationship with the management company Videll’s LaForte says the company is “transitioning” out of all of its remaining facilities “This is not a result anybody wanted ” he says  “It is an unfortunate situation  I regret the outcome ”So  how did this happen Caring for elders who are dependent on Medicaid is always challenging  says Bane  In this state  Medicaid payments short facilities on patient costs to the tune of $37 per patient per day  He’s hoping the state will authorize an increase  the first since 2005 Videll  a new company  lacked the expertise and experience to run homes in that difficult environment  he says  The firm also took over running the homes with way too little advance scrutiny Everybody in this business does that  says Senator Harriette Chandler  The Worcester Democrat has filed legislation calling for public hearings whenever the state issues or removes nursing home licenses  Operators should be made to say publicly how they would operate facilities  she says  And members of the community  local officials  and nursing home employees should be allowed to testify  n“Hospitals can’t come and go” without a public process  she says  “Nursing homes shouldn’t be able to come and go under the cover of darkness  We are talking about lives here ”Amen to that  I hope the next administration is up to this challenge  Because  after pursuing this story for several months  I’m not sure the current one is  Getting information  even basic details  on Park Place from the Department of Public Health has been way too difficult  Responses take days or weeks or never come at all What gives  Maybe the state doesn’t have a handle on what is going on in the nursing homes it is supposed to be overseeing  Maybe they just can’t be bothered to inform the public about a matter that is vital to so many people  Maybe  a mere seven months from the end of Governor Deval Patrick’s administration they have senioritis and figure they’re done with the people’s business If it’s this hard to get timely responses from them when you’re a reporter with a public platform  imagine how frustrating it must be if you’re the anonymous daughter of someone in a nursing home or an employee who wants to raise the alarm about lousy conditions Videll is lucky that none of their clients came to serious harm  So is the state But as the baby boomers age  we’re going to see many more men and women  many of them reliant on Medicaid  taking refuge in nursing homes  We’re going to see many more big corporations looking to profit from their frail  crowded corner of society  And unless we’re more vigilant

investigative panel later this year  t n“I’m very concerned if businesses are not repaying their loans ” Yancey told the Globe  “They should repay their debt ”Meanwhile  Ways and Means chairman Mark Ciommo called the delinquency rate — more than half of nearly $4 million in outstanding loans — “extremely high ” He said he wants to see if a broader authorized by Mayor Martin J  Walsh will examine the loan fund before calling for  council hearings “I see a significant failure rate of repayment  and that’s concerning ” said Ciommo  of Allston Brighton  “We need an accounting of who is in arrearage and why ”The Globe reported Monday that 51 percent of the total amount borrowed from the Boston Local Development was delinquent for 90 days or longer  according to an audit for the year ended June 30  2013  The rate was more than 50 times greater that of banks with similar loans  according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp  The delinquent loans averaged more than $100 000 each The loan program by the private  nonprofit BRA unit is funded through local and federal grants The agency was created in 1979 to make loans to small businesses  Yancey called the program “laudable ” but said he wants to know why borrowers fell behind and became delinquent  and why some loans “didn’t pan out ”Yancey has not yet scheduled the hearing  But he said he plans to examine whether the agency’s lending activities are distributed across the city’s neighborhoods  how many jobs borrowers are creating  and who is getting those jobs — and whether they’re going to Bostonians  “There has to be transparency ” said Yancey  whose district includes Dorchester and Mattapan Ciommo said he is sympathetic to the needs of small businesses  but also expressed concern over borrowed money not repaid on time  “If borrowers don’t repay on time  the agency’s revolving fund can’t make new loans to other worthy small businesses  he said “If I don’t pay my mortgage  they take my house ” Ciommo said The US Economic Development Agency  which provided $1 5 million in 1982 to help seed the loan fund  is working with the Boston loan fund to “address its high default rate ” a spokeswoman said Economic development chief John Barros said the city plans to curb delinquencies by pairing borrowers with city programs and may infuse the program with new capital  The agency has restructured or is close to restructuring nearly $1 million loans William Nickerson  chief financial manager  said in a statement that he welcomes the opportunity to discuss his agency’s track record with the City Council  He said the loan agency seeks timely repayments  but noted that its mission to spur economic development and job growth leads it to take on riskier borrowers than many banks would “Our loans have supported investments in neighborhoods across the city and created thousands of jobs ” Nickerson said  “We strive to be a patient lender  and we are now seeing an encouraging trend in loan repayment rates as small businesses get back on track in the wake of the recession ” n•  n•  n•  n', '2014_494')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no

skinny Dorchester delinquent to a Hollywood leading man  the actor deserves a pardon for beating a man outside a convenience store in 1988 But to some who remember the havoc he wreaked in Boston almost three decades ago  the disclosure this week that Wahlberg  is infuriating  t nNam Pham  executive director of VietAID  a Vietnamese community organization in Dorchester  said Wahlberg should first apologize directly to Thanh Lam  a Vietnamese man Wahlberg beat with a stick more than a quarter century ago  Wahlberg also screamed obscenities and racial epithets “If I were him I would want the scar on my record erased ” Pham said of Wahlberg  “But I would also ask if I could help erase the scars on the victim ” nIn a separate episode  some from a class that was harassed in 1986 by a group of teens that included Wahlberg were not impressed with his request for a pardon Mary Belmonte  the class teacher  remembered leading her terrified elementary school students down a side street to avoid the hail of rocks  “I’m sure he’s sincere and he wants to clear his name ” Belmonte said  “It would be nice if he could apologize and really own up to what he was ’’Wahlberg  43  is one of at least 70 people who have applied for a pardon in the months before Governor Deval Patrick leaves office Other petitions for pardons have come from a Georgia store manager who sold crack cocaine  a Sheffield father arrested in the mid 90s for bringing marijuana to his high school  and a convicted gang member turned street activist Patrick this yearfor people to apply for pardons or commutations — reductions in prison sentences — leading to a flurry of applications  The guidelines were expanded to include those who pose no risk of re offending and can show they have made extraordinary contributions to society In his application  Wahlberg described the 1988 assault on Lam as the actions of a foolish high school dropout who was under the influence of drugs and alcohol  Wahlberg was 16 at the time “I am deeply sorry for the action that I took on the night of April 8  1988  as well as for any lasting damage that I may have caused the victims ” he wrote  Wahlberg said his conviction stands in the way of expanding his restaurant ventures and working more closely with law enforcement officials to help “at risk individuals ”Wahlberg was sentenced to two years for the 1988 attack and served about 45 days in a Plymouth jail  Lam  Wahlberg’s victim  could not be reached for comment  Wahlberg’s publicist did not return calls for comment Those who had encounters with the young Wahlberg differed on whether his pardon request should be granted  Those critics include people involved in the 1986 incident involving the elementary school children In 1986  Kristyn Atwood  then 9  and a black classmate were on a school field trip at Savin Hill Beach when three boys began following them  They yelled racial slurs  according to court records  then began throwing rocks  One hit Atwood’s forehead One of the boys was Wahlberg  according to court records  The state’s attorney general filed a civil complaint against him and his friends  The complaint was dismissed in 1987 “When people talk about racism in Boston  I always remember that ” said Atwood  now 38 and living in Georgia Atwood was not aware that one of the teens who harassed her and her classmate was Wahlberg He assaulted Lam  the Vietnamese man he encountered outside the convenient store  in 1988 “For him to try to get it overturned and make it seem like it never happened  I don t think that’s fair ” she said  referring to his request for a pardon But Emmett Folgert  longtime head of the Dorchester Youth Collaborative in Fields Corner  said Wahlberg’s ability to get past his crimes and go on to achieve enormous success is inspirational “He sure is a role model for anyone who comes from a low income urban neighborhood and makes good ” said Folgert  who knew Wahlberg when he was a 13 year old breakdancing at DYC  a non profit center with the mission of steering teenagers and children away from crime Wahlberg donates to the center regularly and every year sends hundreds of children living in Dorchester to summer camps in New England  Folgert said “He’s never forgotten where he came from ” Folgert said  “He deserves  a pardon   Absolutely he deserves to be pardoned  Look at what he’s done ”The Rev  James Flavin  who was a parish priest in Dorchester  counseled the actor when he was a teenager  The two men are still close “His life speaks for itself ” Flavin said  “He’s really turned his life around in faith  family and giving back  They’re the hallmarks of his life ”Wahlberg’s bid  first reported this week by NECN  has some in the legal community hoping that the celebrity’s application will shed more light on a byzantine process that often forces people to wait months to learn whether they will have a chance to go before the Advisory Board of Pardons to make their case “You file a petition and it’s sort of a waiting game to find out if you get a hearing ” said Rosemary C  Scapicchio  a Boston defense lawyer  “If someone high profile like Wahlberg wants to get a pardon and he’s able to secure a hearing then maybe it gives a road map to the rest of us ”If Wahlberg is granted a hearing before the advisory board  also known as the Parole Board  he would have to answer questions during a recorded  public process  The board would then make a recommendation to the governor  who decides whether to forward the pardon application to the Governor’s Council  an elected body that has the final word whether a pardon is granted Only 10 hearings have been granted this year  five of those cases were recommended to the governor  and Patrick has passed along four to the council  The last time pardons were granted was in 2002  during acting Governor Jane Swift’s administration On Friday  Patrick declined to say whether he would consider Wahlberg’s application “I don’t look at applications ” Patrick told reporters at the Statehouse  “I just get recommendations that come to me from the Parole Board  and I’m not going to get involved until something does  if it does ”If the board recommends Wahlberg’s petition and Patrick approves it  Wahlberg will probably have to go before the Governor’s Council for another public hearing  The council would then take a vote Councilor Mike Albano said Wahlberg’s application shows he has changed “If and when Governor Patrick         submits the petition to the Council  I am prepared to act favorably ” Albano said Councilor Terrence Kennedy said he hopes to hear from the victim or his family if they chose to speak out “I don t know anything about the crime ” Kennedy said  “I know he’s done a lot of good things and that’s what pardons are about  It’s for people who have changed their lives and want to clear their names ” n•  n•  n', '2014_549')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article',

sensitivity as an undertaker has long been legendary  But it is Williams’ other business that is causing him some pain of his own right now  nIt is called the Botanica Ache  in Dudley Square  and it’s an unusual kind of retail establishment  For 40 years it has specialized in selling products like incense and exotic herbal remedies  Williams says he counts followers of Santeria and other African derived religions among his most devoted customers  It’s a place for people who don’t care for modern pharmacies  or don’t trust doctors  or who might want to place a spell  for good or otherwise  on someone who’s crossed their path It is a small piece of Roxbury’s soul that Dudley may no longer have room for  The botanica has always operated above its landlord  Tropical Foods — the closest thing to a supermarket in the area  But the food store is selling the building and relocating  The current Tropical Foods site is slated to become condominiums and retail space — which leaves the botanica facing eviction  That doesn’t sit well with Williams  who believes he is wrongly  perhaps illegally  becoming a victim of gentrification Tropical Foods’ new building is under construction on a long vacant lot around the corner  At 27 000 square feet it will be nearly three times the size of the current one  the full service grocery Dudley residents have longed for  But it won’t have any space for an offbeat incense store  Owner Ron Garry Jr  broke the news to Williams last November  nWhen Williams went looking for new space  he was afflicted with a severe case of sticker shock   No longer are there any rental deals for $200 a month  or deals sealed with a handshake  Re creating the kind of space Williams occupies now will cost approximately $8 000 a month  a price he says he cannot afford  He has threatened to sue  while also calling on city and state officials to intervene  a tactic clearly meant to pressure the new owners into finding space for his business  In a typical neighborhood twist  Garry  the store owner  has his own ties to Botanica Ache  his grandfather established it  Garry has known Williams for years  making their feud excruciating  He offered to let Williams stay rent free for a year  while the new supermarket is being built  But Williams believes he is entitled to much more than that  “This isn’t easy ” Garry said Tuesday  “It was a hard decision  but it’s a business decision ” Williams argues that state law dictates that if federal funds are used for a site — as in the case  of the Tropical Foods relocation — displaced tenants are entitled to the value of their businesses  He wants to be paid for his business if he is forced out of it  Garry argues that Williams is due reasonable moving expenses  which he is willing to pay  but nothing more  “I don’t want to disparage his business ” Garry said  “But he isn’t doing a lot of business ” This scene is likely to be replayed repeatedly as the development of Roxbury leaves some of  its bedrock residents and businesses behind “For 20 years people have seen what is coming down the road ” Garry said  “For those merchants and those people who paid really cheap rent and didn’t secure a long term lease or buy a building  they didn’t plan for the future ”Even for those who can afford to stay  the future is a little scary  “I’m shaking in my boots  too ” Garry said  “Can my customers afford to live here  We’ve known our marketplace for 40 years  but will it be the same marketplace ” Williams  meanwhile  feels he has been treated shabbily  and others will be too  “Over the years

playing for me ” Richards recalled  “But Shabazz always had that energy and that love for the game  He was like a little Globetrotter  The league I ran then was for kids from 7 to 9  but he played anyway  even though he was only 5 ”Napier  who plays point guard  speaks often about his close ties to the Roxbury community  and how those ties have nurtured him  He later played for Charlestown High and Lawrence Academy before enrolling at UConn  where he is a senior  Richards coached him until he was about 14  nWhen Richards started coaching kids in Boston neighborhoods  his motive was not purely love of the game  “I started the program with an idea to keep my son and my nephew off the streets ” Richards said  “We just wanted to keep these kids in a league and off the streets Thus his program  “No Books  No Ball ” was born  The idea was that to play on his court  you had to take your schooling seriously From a handful of kids at the Roxbury Y  the program quickly mushroomed  There turned out to be a lot of kids  and single parents  looking for a safe alternative to the streets  About 240 kids now take part in the program every year  paying $125 a head  Much of that goes for uniforms and the now obligatory trophy for each player at the end of the season Richards talks often about the “tough love” aspect of his program  in which discipline and academics easily trump athletic prowess “At least 60 to 70 percent of our kids will have lost interest in playing by 11th grade ” Richards said  “That not what it’s really about ”For the ones with the drive and talent to play at a higher level  Richards emphasizes that those dreams would not come true without taking school seriously  a detail sometimes lost on adolescents “Without the academic part  the basketball part is a dream that will just die ” he said  “It’s like a balloon with the air seeping out ”Richards runs his league while holding down a full time job as a bridge inspector for the MBTA  “It’s a Houdini act  for sure ” he said  It helps that some of the kids he mentored two decades ago  including his son  are back to coach their successors  The games  which moved to Orchard Gardens a few years ago  have become neighborhood attractions “Some of the mothers tell me it’s like a weekend outing ” Richards said proudly  “They come to watch their kids and stay and watch two or three other games  The energy is just electrifying ”As for Napier  known for being at his best under pressure  Richards said his poise is nothing new  “He’s played under that pressure all his life ” he said  “We yelled at him when he was a little kid  so he’s used to that ”Saturday afternoon  Richards will be overseeing his league’s annual championship game at the Reggie Lewis Track  After the game  Napier s brother will present the league’s Most Improved Player Award  now named for Shabazz Napier After that  Richards and few friends plan to head to Slade’s to cheer on an old friend in his quest for a championship  a boy from Roxbury on a national sports stage  Still  Richards says coaching basketball is secondary to offering guidance “You see these single mothers  you see these kids that need mentoring ” he said  “That’s the energy that keeps me coming back ”', '2014_836')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no

sergeant and unmanned aircraft systems operator  Gates had set his sights on culinary school before he medically retired  “I can remember my great grandmother  when I got off the bus she would make soups from scratch ” Gates says  “Smelling her home and knowing that there was this love put into it  Maybe that planted the seed ”  nNow Gates is paying for school on a plan similar to the Post 9 11 GI Bill  The Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment Program  a Department of Veterans Affairs education program for veterans with service connected disabilities  assists Gates with the $13 230 tuition  fees  and supplies  an average total of $15 000 per semester at the culinary school  Gates  who is recently divorced  also receives a monthly housing allowance based on his sergeant E 5 rank

Association  In the next five years  the NRA projects the number of employment opportunities will increase by 25 000   The Army transitions 80 000 to 100 000 veterans to civilian life annually  meaning 1 million  nof them will be job hunting over the next decade  Growing industries and veteran benefits play a large role in a veteran’s success In 2013  more than 1 million veterans participated in VA education programs  according to the department  an increase of nearly 600 000 since 2001  The increase is due to the US military’s drawdowns in Iraq and Afghanistan  the department

attended a 24 week course in advanced training in unmanned aircraft systems operations  In late 2008  he was deployed to Afghanistan for a year  where he reenlisted for another four  But declining physical health affecting his knees and back cut Gates’s military career short  Since then  he’s been feeling selfish for focusing on his personal future  he says  “There is something in knowing that you are going to sacrifice so much for your country  It is very powerful ” he says Gates hasn’t decided if he will enter a longer CIA program to earn a bachelor’s degree in culinary science  He hopes to continue recipe development writing  a gig that allows him to avoid standing for 12 hours at a time The mission may not be the same as the military’s  but Gates finds meaning in the kitchen  “Food

summer  There’s a pair in the gubernatorial race  What’s got Steve Grossman and Charlie Baker all tripped up is Martha Coakley’s proposed settlement with Partners HealthCare that would allow the mammoth system to take over three more hospitals and sign up hundreds of doctors on the condition that it caps price increases for most of a decade   t nIn May  Grossman told The Boston Globe it was a “ ” and Baker described it as a good start  But as criticism over the terms of the attorney general’s settlement has mounted  Grossman and Baker have changed their tune on their chief political opponent’s proposal  Last week  Grossman  the Democratic state treasurer  called the settlement a “bad deal” and said Coakley’s handling of the negotiations demonstrated a “failure of leadership” because they were conducted in secret Baker  the leading Republican in the race  decided to do his own 180 in an interview Monday at Brothers Deli  the Mattapan restaurant that has become a see and be seen stop for anyone running for office  While Grossman’s shift reeks of pure politics  Baker seemed to have thought it through based on his experience running Harvard Pilgrim Health Care years ago  In between handshakes with patrons and bites of a turkey club  Baker told me he no longer supports Partners’s expansion  unless its rates are frozen for the first five years and no more doctors are added to its network  He also called for more transparency in pricing  with the idea that if patients better understood what they were paying for at Partners  they would flock to lower cost providers He also didn’t like the framework of the settlement  which is based more on trying to monitor the company’s conduct than changing its structure   t n“The agreement is pretty complicated ” said Baker  “I worry about the ability of the next AG to enforce it ”That’s a concern I’ve heard from others  Sure  there is the state created Health Policy Commission  stacked with boldface names  but with no real power Both Baker and Grossman objected to being called flip floppers  explaining they shifted positions once they learned more about the settlement  Or  they realized they better get on the right side of a decision that will affect nearly everyone in Massachusetts for decades  Baker’s relationship with Partners is as complicated as the deal itself  In 1994  he was a wunderkind in the Weld administration as the governor’s secretary of health and human services  Baker signed off on the merger between Massachusetts General and Brigham and Women’s that established Partners  which today consists of 10 hospitals and over 6 000 doctors Critics say the marriage allowed Partners to become a Goliath that controls the market and drives up prices In a 2008 interview with the Globe  Baker said he had come to regret the decision  comparing it to “having the grenade that you throw on one end of the boat roll back down and blow up on you when the boat shifts ”A few weeks ago  The New York Times editorial board called the merger “” and raised the idea that the Legislature should study whether it should be “undone in some way ”Candidate Baker refrains from using such colorful language to describe what happened in 1994  but said “hindsight is a great thing ” As for undoing the merger  he said “it would be pretty hard ” To his credit  Grossman doesn’t pretend to be a health care expert and knows it doesn’t look good when politicians switch positions  “People can say what they want ” he said Tuesday  He said he follows what the Health Policy Commission does  and when he thought the agency was happy about the deal  so was he  The commission is not taking a formal position  but when it reported recently that pact could increase medical spending by tens of millions of dollars annually  Grossman stopped liking the agreement  Still  the treasurer believes a deal of some kind is better than the attorney general suing Partners to prevent it from acquiring more hospitals  including the coveted South Shore Hospital in Weymouth  For her part  Coakley stands by her deal  the best one the Democrat could wrangle out of Partners without filing an antitrust suit  A judge will hold a hearing in September to consider whether to approve the settlement   “This agreement in no way forecloses future action ” she said in interview this week at a Roxbury campaign stop  Nor will it

children perched on his beige golf cart as he drives up a hill at the family’s Cape Cod home Adrift on Nantucket Sound  JFK polishes off a vanilla ice cream cone as he watches John Jr  play with a toy boat  t nA new exhibit at the John F  Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum in Dorchester offers a look at the private life of the glamorous  young president  when he was away from the stresses of the White House and immersed in the comfort of his childhood summer home in Hyannis Port The golf cart is among several artifacts on display for the first time as part of the “Presidential Getaway  JFK on Cape Cod” exhibit  It includes the president’s golf clubs and a box of his personalized golf balls  a toy sailboat given to John Jr  by the president of Italy  and colorful  hand carved wooden birds  replicas of a species native to the Cape  that were gifts to JFK from his wife  Jacqueline Kennedy  nMost of the items on display have been stored in the museum for decades  but the museum decided to bring them out this summer as a sunnier counterpoint to last year’s exhibit on the 50th anniversary of JFK’s assassination At the time  the room now filled with the president’s golf balls and his son’s toy boat was occupied by the boots  saddle  and sword from Black Jack  the riderless horse at JFK’s state funeral procession in Washington  D C  The flag that draped his coffin was also on display Documentaries and news reports released on the anniversary focused on the circumstances of his death  as well as his political achievements  With this new exhibit  scheduled to be open through the end of October  the museum hopes people will remember JFK as a fun loving family man  its curator  Stacey Bredhoff  said  t n“We’re really happy to have him come back to life with this display ” she said  “It shows a side of him people don’t get to see ”A five minute movie made from newly released film taken by White House photographer Cecil Stoughton in 1963 provides different snapshots of the president’s getaway  where JFK would swim  tan  sail  golf  and spend time with his family Throughout his presidency  JFK on weekends visited the compound in Hyannis Port  an “emotional center for the Kennedy family ” Bredhoff said The president’s siblings often joined those weekend visits  One scene in the film shows Robert F  Kennedy throwing the remaining candy from a battered pinata to a swarm of boisterous children JFK’s beloved sailboat  the Victura  is parked on a strip of the museum’s lawn visible from the exhibit room  The white 25 foot sloop was a childhood gift from his parents  and the museum puts it on display every summer  In the film  JFK can be seen sailing it through Nantucket Sound’s blue waters The slain president’s treasured boat has received renewed attention recently  A book released earlier this year  “Victura  The Kennedys  a Sailboat  and the Sea ” by James W  Graham  focuses on the Kennedys’ relationship with the Victura and their affinity for sailing The golf cart  which the museum sent away for restoration  was featured on the cover of Look magazine in January 1962  Before being encased in glass for this summer’s exhibit  the golf cart was polished and its wheels filled with air During the opening morning of the exhibit Friday  dozens of visitors milled in and out of the room  some pausing to look at the iconic photographs on display  Others stood at the window and stared at the Victura  which hasn’t touched sea in decades  A man sat to watch the film as his wife and children  all from Jacksonville  Fla   walked around

is stuff that he really loved ” her brother  Gage McNamee  added A framed photo of JFK in midswing  clad in pink pants  blue polo  and sunglasses  is accompanied by excerpts from an interview in which the pro golfer Arnold Palmer critiques the president’s form Bredhoff said JFK asked Stoughton  the White House photographer  to show Palmer film of the president playing  But that didn’t happen till three years ago  when Palmer was shown the footage and commented on Kennedy’s form in an interview for Golf Magazine After praising JFK’s wardrobe  Palmer goes on to say that Kennedy “looks pretty good over the ball  pretty solid  But he needs to firm up his hands ”Palmer seems to favor JFK over Bill Clinton  whom he calls more athletic but less accurate  He concludes that JFK is “very fixable

presented Wednesday night to the School Committee The $70 7 million school originally was slated for  in Roxbury  an academically struggling middle school at risk of being placed into state receivership  But under the proposal  Dearborn would be converted into a charter school for fall 2015 and be run by the Dudley Street Neighborhood Charter School  which already operates a Roxbury elementary school on behalf of the school system  t nInterim Superintendent John McDonough is pitching the proposal in a preemptive attempt to avoid having Dearborn taken over by the state  Having the state seize control of the city’s newest school building could be embarrassing for Boston  education advocates said  Construction is expected to be completed in about three years “We do have concerns based on recent test scores that lead us to thinking boldly and broadly about the future of the Dearborn ” McDonough said in an interview Tuesday  “From my perspective  this is about placing students in an environment where there will be a higher probability of success ”The move comes nearly a year after the state  in an unprecedented move for Boston  placed two city schools into   the Dever and Holland schools  both in Dorchester  The action put a blemish on Mayor Thomas M  Menino’s education record as he was leaving office  and both McDonough and Mayor Martin J  Walsh have vowed to never again let a Boston school fall into the hands of the state But the prospect of a charter school moving into a new building is expected to generate heated debate as many parents and educators have been raising concerns about further encroachment of charter schools into the city’s school system “I think Dearborn teachers and the rest of the city will see this as one more step to eliminate traditional schools ” said Richard Stutman  president of the Boston Teachers Union Dearborn is among 15 underperforming schools statewide that the state Department of Elementary and Secondary Education is closely scrutinizing to determine whether any of them will be taken over this fall That list includes three others in Boston  English High School in Jamaica Plain  Elihu Greenwood Leadership Academy in Hyde Park  and Jeremiah Burke High School in Dorchester McDonough said he is planning a charter school proposal only for Dearborn Under the proposal  Dudley Street would operate Dearborn as an “in district” charter school  allowing the School Department to maintain some oversight — unlike most other charter schools that operate independently of the school system The arrangement with Dearborn would be similar to how Dudley Street operates its elementary school on Shirley Street All students enrolled at Dearborn would be guaranteed seats at Dudley Street Neighborhood Charter School  which would expand up to grade 12 Other elements of the proposal  however  are still being worked out  It remains undetermined  for instance  whether the elementary school and the secondary school would run as two separate entities or as a unified K 12 school split between two sites Another complication also exists  Dearborn  starting this fall  will temporarily locate at Burke while its current building on Greenville Street is demolished and rebuilt The proposal will require approval from the School Committee in the coming weeks and eventually state education officials Michael O’Neill  chairman of the School Committee  said he is looking forward to hearing the proposal and the community feedback “We want to make sure we are doing everything possible to improve schools ” O’Neill said  “Clearly  the superintendent has some concerns about the Dearborn and the amount of improvement he has seen to date ”O’Neill could not predict how the board would vote  Last summer  the committee decided against endorsing a different proposal to allow Dudley Street to become a K 8 because it had only been open for a year and did not have all its grade levels up and running  This past school year  the school only served students up to the second grade Jesse Solomon  executive director of BPE  a Boston education nonprofit and cofounder of the Dudley Street school  said everyone involved is looking forward to the challenge of overhauling Dearborn and creating a seamless K 12 for the Dudley Street area “All we want to do at the end of the day is create great schools ” Solomon said  “That is our hope ”JC Considine  a state education spokesman  said state education officials have not seen the proposal but are aware that Dudley Street was interested in working with Dearborn on its overhaul effort Dearborn parents and supporters could not be reached for comment Tuesday  They had pushed for seven years to make school construction a reality  finally winning funding approval from the Massachusetts School Building Authority in March and recently from the City Council The school’s focus on science and technology was expected to be a boon for the Roxbury area  The Dudley Street

pall has been cast on home ownership  And justifiably so — Americans lost trillions in wealth  Now rentals are the new hot thing  Yet the truth remains that we don’t have a system that can adequately house the population  especially those of modest means  in either the owner occupied or rental markets It’s time to consider a third way  a middle ground between renting and home ownership  It’s commonly known as “shared equity” housing  and here’s an example of how it works  t nA nonprofit entity forms what’s called a community land trust  which operates by selling homes — but not the land underneath them — at a manageable price to families with low or moderate incomes  If they later decide to sell their home  a cap on resale profit keeps the price low to remain affordable to a new family of similar means The approach brings stability to the wild swings that can be characteristic in housing markets  Foreclosures are virtually nonexistent at one of the most successful trusts in the country  right here in Boston — the Dudley Street Neighborhood Initiative in Roxbury  this fall celebrating its 30th anniversary According to the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy  at the peak of the Great Recession  in 2009  conventional loans were eight times more likely to experience foreclosure than community land trust mortgages  That’s even more impressive considering most people with such mortgages have lower incomes than other homeowners Community land trusts  along with inclusionary housing policies  can be a bulwark against gentrification as well  Research has shown they provide an outlet for affordable housing amid what are almost inevitably skyrocketing prices at transit oriented development sites But although the US Department of Housing and Urban Development gave its blessing to the shared equity concept several years ago  sadly  some barriers have emerged  The Federal Housing Administration has said it can’t back mortgages to community land trusts  citing a legislative technicality In terms of outcome — that is  people of modest means buying homes — the FHA’s own experience of shared equity housing has been excellent  In the 1990s  the agency made an exception to the policy and backed mortgage loans for buyers at the Church Community Housing Corporation  a community land trust in Jamestown  R I  nYvette Thompson bought a home there in 2012 with an FHA backed mortgage  “Even though I’m working full time — I couldn’t afford to pay a regular mortgage  my family’s medical expenses  and buy groceries without it ” says Thompson  who lives in a modest 1 500 square foot cottage with her daughter  “A lot of people in my financial category need some kind of break to own a home ”Steve Ostiguy  director of the Jamestown organization  says of the 100 houses in the community land trust  only one went into foreclosure  and it was promptly bought back  so FHA insurance was never actually needed  “They should be beating down our door to be able to provide insurance for our buyers ” he says  “We’re here to educate families and help them to resolve their financial problems — so the risk for FHA is minuscule ”The new HUD secretary  Julian Castro  wants to encourage homeownership  In the latest issue of Housing Policy Debate  authors Susan Rosen Wartell and Mark A  Willis call for FHA to “promote innovation” by piloting new programs to “mitigate risk ” Community land trusts are proven successes  but with credit still tight everywhere  they need FHA backed loans The third path between renting and homeownership is tantalizingly within reach  It would be a shame if bureaucratic entanglements stood in the way', '2014_131')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('Two suspects were arrested and charged with assault in

include attempted murder  assault and battery on a police officer  assault and battery on a person over 60  and a lewd and lascivious act  Procopio said The victim was taken to a hospital for

Tom Menino’s eulogy  It was his idea But Mitch Weiss  Menino’s last chief of staff  didn’t have one — until the moments before it was his turn to speak  t n“If the mayor could  he would say  ‘Get the Jewish kid a stool ’ ” Weiss blurted out to a  with laughter at Menino’s memorial service this month The mayor was always ribbing Weiss about something  and he wanted one last parting shot  tickled by the thought of Weiss sitting through a Catholic Mass and learning the prayers In the weeks since we’ve said goodbye to our longtime mayor  what’s got tongues wagging is how Weiss  out of all the people Menino had known  got to deliver his eulogy  More important  was there a message in the messenger Weiss was Menino’s sixth chief of staff and held that role for four years — a blip in an administration that lasted two decades and a political career that stretched even longer They were an unlikely pairing  a 71 year old old school politician from Hyde Park and a 38 year old Harvard Business School graduate not from around here Until Weiss stepped into the pulpit of the Most Precious Blood Church  most people had never heard or seen him  which is what made Weiss and Menino a perfect match  Weiss prefers to work behind the scenes  while Menino liked to be front and center Weiss kept such a low profile that he likes to recount how a TV newscast describing the scene outside the Menino home after his passing mistakenly identified Weiss as one of the mayor’s grandchildren Even more intriguing is whether Weiss deprived Bill Clinton of saying a few words at the funeral  That rumor has been ferociously bouncing around town  Catholics are sticklers about the eulogy — and they prefer one per Mass I’m told that’s not what happened  At one point  the Menino family wondered about Clinton’s availability to speak  but nothing was formalized in the whirl of funeral arrangements  In the end  the former president went to Faneuil Hall  where Menino was laying in state  to pay his respects Which brings us back to the beginning  So how did a staffer little known outside City Hall get the honor of doing Menino’s eulogy To find out  I headed off to   where Weiss now teaches entrepreneurship  Sitting in his office  he recounted how two weeks before Menino’s Oct  30 death  the former mayor asked Weiss to do the eulogy Besides the Jewish joke  the mayor requested that Weiss bring the “music ” That’s what his old boss would say when he liked a speech  and it was Weiss who wrote the mayor’s major policy speeches In the quiet moments before and after visits to Menino at the hospital  Weiss began taking notes on his iPhone  Three days before the funeral  Weiss began writing  the words — and tears — flowing out of him The seven minute eulogy covered a lot of ground  How Menino offered him the chief of staff post over a meal of tripe  How Team Menino wasn’t a machine because it “had your big  beating heart ” How the mayor would pester Weiss’s 2 year old daughter  Hannah  for ice cream “I can still see her shaking her head  ‘No ’ u2009” Weiss said “It’s a good thing ” he continued  “she didn’t need building permits ”By most accounts  the eulogy was a hit  The Menino family and Team Menino loved it  but so did strangers who tracked Weiss down at Harvard  saying his remarks made them cry “No  he made you cry ” Weiss would say  referring to Menino  “I just put words to it ”Some folks wonder if Menino  in tapping Weiss  was making one last political statement  handing the baton to the next generation of city leaders  Was this the beginning of a Weiss campaign “I’m not angling to run for public office ” said Weiss  “And definitely that’s not what the mayor was thinking ”Still  Weiss wants to change the world  and that’s why he is at Harvard to pioneer a   one that brings together private entrepreneurs and public leaders to solve problems  Think along the lines of   the novel pop up bus service that supplements mass transit Last week Weiss’s daughter asked if the mayor was still sick  He had been telling her that Menino was sleeping  But his wife nudged him  saying it was time to be straight “No ” Weiss told her  “He died like the flowers

prayer service dedicated to justice and healing  following the recent slayings of two New York City police officers and nationwide protests over grand jury decisions in New York and Ferguson  Mo   that cleared white officers in the deaths of unarmed black men  “Today  we’ve got to do everything that we can to  prevent  something bad from happening tomorrow ” Walsh told the gathering of about 60 people at Twelfth Baptist Church on Warren Street  n t nThe service followed the funeral on Saturday in Queens  N Y   for Rafael Ramos  a New York police officer who was fatally shot along with his partner  Wenjian Liu  as they sat in their patrol car in Brooklyn  The gunman  who later killed himself  had earlier posted antipolice messages on social media    The attack had followed weeks of protests  in Boston and elsewhere  over grand jury decisions in Ferguson and New York that resulted in no charges being filed against officers in the deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner  The Rev  Jeffrey Brown  associate pastor of Twelfth Baptist Church  said during Monday night’s service that “in light of what happened recently  I thought it was important to bring everyone together ” Those in attendance did not discuss police policy proposals at the service  But with heads bowed  they prayed for Boston officers as well as activists  some of whom have organized street demonstrations on behalf of Brown and Garner  often under the rallying cry “Black Lives Matter ” n“All lives matter ” said the Rev  William Dickerson  pastor of the Greater Love Tabernacle Church in Dorchester during one of the many solemn prayers for unity  He asked that Boston residents not forget “our ugly past” in the realm of race relations and prayed that the city would “lead in righteousness ”“Let us lead in justice and equality ” he added  The service included singing and the laying of hands by clergy on members of the Boston police command staff and on several young community activists  The Rev  Richard “Doc” Conway of St  Peter’s parish in Dorchester led a prayer for the assembled police officers  including Commissioner William B  Evans and his second in command  Superintendent in Chief William G  Gross  nConway praised city police officers for their personal sacrifices and efforts to help local youth   n“They protect us in so many ways ” Conway said  “Please give them the respect they deserve from the people of the city of Boston ” The Rev  Liz Walker of Roxbury Presbyterian Church followed Conway with a prayer for the  community activists  “We thank you for their passion ” she said  “We thank you for their courage and  willingness  to speak out for justice ” None of the police officials or activists spoke during the prayer service  but one advocate  Shaun Leonard  28  of Jamaica Plain  told reporters afterward that demonstrators are concerned over racial issues but also economic inequity  “It’s much bigger than race ” Leonard said  Walsh had sounded a similar note  telling the crowd that his administration was working to expand educational opportunities in the city’s poorest neighborhoods  He cited the student protests at Madison Park Technical Vocational High School last fall when class schedules were not ready at the start of the academic year  After some changes  Walsh said  the school is now “on track to be successful ”“It shows you the power of the young peoples’ voice by speaking out ” he said  Meanwhile  activists have announced their intention to protest killings by police by staging a die in  in which demonstrators plan to lay on the ground  outside the Boston Public Library in Copley Square during the city’s annual First Night activities  In addition to the protests in Boston over the grand jury rulings in the Brown and Garner cases

according to industry standards ’’The Joint Commission would not comment on its findings at the Fuller  but the hospital was re accredited During the spring  the hospital “environment of care committee’’ repeatedly discussed the windows and two managers decided to obtain cost estimates  according to meeting minutes described in the federal report An e mail in May from the Executive Office

June incident and again asking for funds for Lexan windows for “patient safety ’’In a written statement  mental health department spokeswoman Anna Chinappi said that after the June incident  “DMH put

social worker interviewed by investigators said the money was approved Dec  12  the day after Puchalow jumped After his death  the agency assessed other state owned facilities and determined the windows were safe  made of Lexan or safety glass that is difficult to break  or covered with protective screens  the mental health department said The hospital’s correction plan submitted to federal

family  the state paid for his burial in a section for poor Bostonians in  nFairview Cemetery in Hyde Park  hospital staff said  His anonymous grave can be identified only by the number 36 hand drawn on a slab of concrete That upset caregivers who visited the site  and the state agreed to pay for a metal plaque with his name and the words “In Loving Memory ’’ Staff are deciding where to put it “Staff here really wanted to do something to commemorate him ” said one employee  who was afraid of being fired if identified  “They were very invested in him  There are people who really suffered and

onetime star  now murder defendant — in their rear view mirror a long time ago  But in January  the disgraced player could be back in the same news cycle as his old team  t nJury selection for the Hernandez murder trial is slated to begin Jan  9 — just as the Patriots hope to be preparing to play in the   The election of Bristol County District Attorney C  Samuel Sutter as mayor of Fall River does not change the trial schedule  a spokesman said With success on the field and an appealing cast of new and veteran players  the Patriots rekindled comforting old themes of discipline and character  But Hernandez in the court room is a reminder of the key question raised after his arrest in June 2013 for the murder of Odin Lloyd  27  of Dorchester  Where was that discipline and character when they drafted Hernandez From a PR perspective  the Patriots successfully moved on from that dark time  The organization cut Hernandez loose hours after  with Lloyd’s murder  Anyone who bought a Hernandez jersey could exchange it — a gesture designed to show the team’s disdain for a player once thought to epitomize the Patriot way  In July 2013  head coach Bill Belichickwhat he called a “sad day” involving “an individual who happened to be a New England Patriot ”  When asked if the Patriots knew anything about Hernandez’ alleged involvement in a 2012 double homicide or a shooting incident in Miami  Belichick said “no ”With that  the Patriots ended discussion of the larger judgment issue facing the NFL   a player’s athletic potential versus the risk of scandal based on prior behavior But they couldn’t duck the legal process  Belichick and team owner Robert Kraft were both interviewed by investigators and both are  as potential prosecution witnesses  Whether either is called is questionable  since the witness list tops 300  The Patriots agreed to turn over 317 pages of Hernandez’s personnel and   Some  exchanged between Belichick and Hernandez are also part of the evidence  In the court of public opinion  Hernandez swiftly went from hero to killer  In a separate case  he is also charged with first degree murder in a 2012 double slaying in Boston  Yet  all charges against him must  of course  be proven beyond reasonable doubt in a court of law  Massachusetts Superior Court Judge Susan Garsh that a text message Lloyd sent to his sister minutes before his murder is inadmissible  In it  Lloyd said he was with “ NFL ”  That was code for Hernandez  prosecutors argued  and showed he was trying to warn his sister of his danger   It also put Lloyd and Hernandez in the same place at the time of the murder  Michael McCann  a Massachusetts lawyer and director of the Sports and Entertainment Law Institute at the University of New Hampshire School of Law  described the judge’s ruling as a significant setback for the prosecution  As he notes  “There is no murder weapon  There are no credible witnesses who will testify that Hernandez is guilty  There is no admissible evidence of Hernandez shooting other people  The universe of incriminating materials against Hernandez has shrunk and his lawyers only need to raise doubt to win ”Still  prosecutors have  that shows Hernandez and two friends picking up Lloyd at his home  There is also video of their car entering the industrial park where Lloyd’s body was found and surveillance photos of Hernandez  apparently holding a gun in his home  after Lloyd was killed “The case is going to come down to a lot of little things adding up ” said Thomas M  Hoopes  a well known Boston criminal defense lawyer who believes the circumstantial evidence against Hernandez is strong  “Can I put him  Hernandez  in the car  What are they going to establish about his state of mind before this guy got killed  And what did he do after the guy got killed ” For the Patriots  the decision on drafting Hernandez probably came down to a lot of little things adding up  This trial may paint a clearer picture of that case  too', '2014_863')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article',

dream that few people believed would ever be realized  building a high school in Mattapan The nearly two decade quest took a notable step forward Wednesday when the City Council approved the first of two required votes on a $120 million loan to build the school  which is proposed for the former Boston State Hospital grounds  It passed by a 9 3 vote   giving Yancey confidence that the second vote will sail through in the coming weeks   t n“It’s just amazing it has taken this long ” Yancey said in a phone interview the day after the vote  “I know when I’ve talked about this high school  people’s eyes would glaze over ”Boston has not built a new high school since the late 1970s  and recent attempts to do so have hit roadblocks For Yancey  the push has always been about providing more of the city’s high school students — many of whom attend buildings designed decades ago as middle or elementary schools — the chance to go to classes in a high school complex that rivals those in the suburbs “We must inspire our children to learn ” Yancey said  “One way to do that is provide first class facilities ”The city is in the process of creating a 10 year master plan for school facilities  and Mayor Martin J  Walsh has not taken a position on the proposal “The plan of the administration is to undertake a comprehensive assessment and take the long view on facilities and infrastructure support ” Kate Norton  the mayor’s spokeswoman  said in an e mail  “The matter is before the City Council now  and we will withhold judgment while the council process continues ”Previously  Boston had pursued school construction projects on an as needed basis and has struggled to bring them to fruition — a point of frustration for many parents  city leaders  and educators as they have seen dozens of schools built in the suburbs in recent years Just last month  the Massachusetts School Building Authority to build a joint facility for Boston Arts Academy and the Josiah Quincy Upper School because of the logistical challenges of construction on the chosen site  which would have involved building above a portion of an interstate highway ramp  The city is searching for a new site Another project  the Dearborn STEM Academy  is running into intense neighborhood opposition because the project calls for demolition of its current building in Roxbury  which many neighbors consider a historic gem John McDonough  the interim school superintendent  said he was receptive to the idea of a Mattapan high school — as long as it is part of a comprehensive facilities plan that would include building  renovating  or closing other schools “You can’t keep adding high school seats without having additional high school students ” McDonough said  “There is a trade off ”Enrollment in Boston’s high schools has dropped by about 2 000 students since 2005  and school officials are bracing for a further drop as more independently run charter schools open in the next few years  About 17 000 students attend about three dozen high schools For that reason  McDonough’s predecessor  Carol R  Johnson   of building a high school in Mattapan in a memorandum she sent to the council last year  But despite the enrollment drop  McDonough said  Boston will still need to replace some aging facilities  even if it reduces the overall number of high school buildings in use  He said if a high school complex was built in Mattapan it could be used by one or more existing high schools currently housed in inadequate buildings or by some new promising program  That decision  he said  would rest with the School Committee Yancey first began his push for a Mattapan high school in 1997  a year after a report commissioned by Mayor Thomas M  Menino named Mattapan as one of two potential sites for two new high schools  But the school system ultimately decided to renovate existing high schools “We pride ourselves on the quality of education we offer  but we have to make investments in our

misleading investigators after the crash  T spokesman Joe Pesaturo said in a statement  She is scheduled to be arraigned next week  Pesaturo said  nThe crash on Sunday morning left a Route 57 bus dangling dramatically above the Massachusetts Turnpike  after it smashed through a guardrail on the Washington Street overpass  The driver and seven passengers were hospitalized with a variety of injuries  none of which were considered life threatening Pesaturo said neither the investigation into the crash nor the disciplinary process has  been completed  The bus involved in Sunday’s crash was equipped with a surveillance camera  which may help investigators determine what went wrong and whether the driver was using her phone before or during the crash  Pesaturo said An official who was not

some higher power at work in what happened here That may be  but the transformation of this triangle of misery is also a lesson in how determined people can make massive change  It began when residents organized to protest the dumping  But activists were smart enough to see that cleaning up wasn’t enough  This part of Roxbury had to be rebuilt  The Dudley Street Neighborhood Initiative

into a bar        No joke  It happened Sunday  at approximately the same time Robin van Persie broke the hearts of Chelsea fans around the world by equalizing for Manchester United in the dying moments at Old Trafford  t nI had retired to The Banshee in Dorchester to watch my beloved Man U  sorry  Mr  Henry  The Banshee is a fine place to watch soccer  the crowd very international  The last thing I expected to see was the Republican gubernatorial candidate walk in with the Dropkick Murphys frontman Baker took time out from his relentless pursuit of the soccer mom vote to come to a place that is a shrine for soccer fans  in an overwhelmingly Democrat neighborhood where the staunchest of Democrats  Mayor Marty Walsh  lives a few streets over  a neighborhood where someone mentions Republicans and everybody thinks they’re talking about the IRA Casey is a liberal  from a big Democrat family  but he voted for Baker four years ago — the first time he ever voted for a Republican  he says  This time around  he’s doing more than voting for Baker  He’s raising money for him  and so they headed to the upstairs room at The Banshee where people had written checks I’ve heard variations of Casey’s story  Tim Doherty  a guy I know in the commercial real estate game  hails from a huge Democrat family  His uncle  the great Gerry Doherty  was Ted Kennedy’s right hand man  But  for the first time in his life  Tim Doherty is not just backing a Republican but raising money for him  He said more than half of the people who came to a fund raiser he threw for Baker’s running mate  Karyn Polito  were Democrats A week before the election  Baker seems to be peaking  There was that Globe poll that had him up 9 points over his Democrat opponent  Attorney General Martha Coakley  Then  on Monday  the Globe endorsed him  the first time the Globe has endorsed a Republican for governor in 20 years On Sunday  when I suggested to Baker he was on a roll  he demurred “That guy is on a roll ” he said  pointing to the screen that showed Tom Brady dissecting the Bad News Chicago Bears  “I’m in a tight race ”Whatever  The last couple of weeks have felt like it’s been getting a lot less tight  in part because Baker has gone places  like The Banshee  where you just don’t expect to find Republican candidates Four years ago  I knew Coakley was going to lose the Senate race to Scott Brown after driving the length of Blue Hill Avenue  4 miles from Mattapan to Roxbury  and counting exactly two Coakley campaign signs on apartment blocks and in store windows that two years earlier were covered with Obama signs This time around  Coakley is again fighting an election that without a presidential draw will mean a lower turnout  especially in the cities where the Democrats usually clean up On Monday  I drove Blue Hill Avenue again  The good news for Coakley is I counted about a dozen of her signs  The bad news is Charlie Baker had just as many More revealing was the sight of Baker’s house signs in Dorchester and Roxbury  side by side with signs for other candidates who are staunch Democrats  like state Senator Linda Dorcena Forry and state Representatives Russell Holmes and Dan Cullinane  Even in Democratic strongholds  some people see no conflict in voting for their Democratic local legislators and a Republican governor  That’s not good news for Martha Coakley Of course  a week is a lifetime in politics  This race is not over  Coakley is tougher than her critics allow  Something unexpected could change those poll numbers  slow Baker’s momentum  and push her over the top  This is  after all  Massachusetts On the heels of the Clintons and Michelle Obama  Vice President Joe Biden will be in town Wednesday to campaign and raise money for Coakley  Biden’s holding the time

Boston that haven’t made their way into public art as much as we might like ” she said The sculpture takes physical cues from traditional structures  such as clock towers and flag poles It will emphasize more modern means of communication such as smartphone apps and real time data sharing It is made from individual lighted tubes that are braided together to create the feeling of a single

that they are launching an intervention to improve long struggling Madison Park Technical Vocational High School  a move that could mean that some teachers will be involuntarily transferred and that some administrators might be replaced John McDonough  the interim schools superintendent  and Boston Teachers Union president Richard Stutman delivered the news to staff during an afternoon meeting at the Roxbury school  nMcDonough said he made the decision to take the step  which will include a broad review of the school  after months of observation “We collectively have not achieved and are far from achieving a culture that is singularly driven by student success ” McDonough said in a telephone interview  nHe acknowledged the stress the review may place on educators  An intervention team will observe lessons  submit teacher reviews  and ultimately provide the superintendent with a report detailing which staff members are suited to stay and which should be removed “That’s a hard message to deliver and a hard message to receive ” he said Stutman said he felt it was too early for teachers to have fully processed the plan  but that most were “pleased to be able to cooperate with the superintendent ”“We all anticipated something might happen ” Stutman said  “We heard an explanation today  but it is premature to worry about everyone’s concerns ”The intervention is intended to ensure that the school’s Innovation Plan  approved by the Boston School Committee in June 2012  is implemented “with fidelity ” the School Department said Since the plan was approved  the system has invested more than $1 million in technology  textbooks  and technical vocational materials  the department said  But the school has not made nearly enough progress  including continuing low attendance and the fact that only 30 of the school’s 1 100 students participated last year in an internship or cooperative career or vocational opportunity  the department said The stakes for turning around Madison Park are high  officials say  It is part of a fledgling program that allows students to enroll in nearby Roxbury Community College  The initiative will ultimately let students earn a high school diploma  an associate’s degree  and technical certification “We are continuing to fail students ” McDonough said  “But Madison has the potential to be a premier vocational school  if we make it one ”Under the intervention  the school system will appoint three persons to a seven member board  the union will appoint three  and both sides will jointly decide on a seventh member The team will study reasons for underperformance and present a plan for improvement  the department said  Analysis will take up to four months  said McDonough “What I’m looking to do is deliberately build a foundation we can build upon next semester ” he said  “Next school year we will reset and establish what should be in place  It will be a year of formation that anchors us to our goals ”The city’s only vocational school  Madison Park has been plagued for years with low standardized test scores and low graduation rates  The school  which educates about 1 100 students  has continued to struggle even after receiving extra resources and extending the school day   nLast summer  parents  alumni  and community activists urged the city to halt what they called a “downward spiral” at Madison Park and to address issues  including building problems “It’s time for action ” Mayor Martin J  Walsh said in a prepared statement  “There have been promises made to these students  but not enough progress  These students have tremendous potential  and they need to see real changes ”McDonough agreed that the focus must be on students  “This is not about me  the administration  or individual teachers ”

Authorities believe the body was that of a black male  5 feet 10 inches to 6 feet tall  weighing 220 to 230 pounds  said Cape and Islands District Attorney Michael O’Keefe  The body also had an old surgical scar in the abdomen area on the right side of the torso  nHe released pictures of the T shirt the body was wearing and the dolly in the hope that someone in the public could help police with clues  He said the usual methods of identifying the body had been “compromised” by the way it had been mutilated “We are seeking information from the public regarding this discovery ” he said The blue T shirt bore the name of Cranston Windustrial  a Warwick  R I   business  He said investigators had already been to the business and people there had been very cooperative But he said the business handed out thousands such T shirts and it appeared that the T shirt was from a batch made six or eight years ago “The hope is that somebody might remember that shirt” or a person matching the description wearing it  he said  He also urged people to step forward if they recognized the dolly  or knew of such a dolly being missing  nHe urged people anywhere in New England to call in with tips  “We want to cast a fairly broad net on this ” he said  The body was discovered by a person walking along Town Neck Road Beach in Sandwich Wednesday night Asked what the man’s cause of death was  O’Keefe said any of the wounds inflicted on the torso could have resulted in death He said police had responded to the beach for a report of a suspicious object  and crime scene investigators had worked through the night to process the scene The body was discovered after careful removal of the wrapping  which also included trash bags  O’Keefe said Police also recovered black  sweatpant type pants  he said Authorities have said they do not believe the person was killed on the beach  and they have been trying to locate where the slaying occurred O’Keefe said the primary crime scene could be anywhere in New England  Asked if the crime scene could be even further afield  he said  “Anything’s possible ”Based on the condition of the body  the slaying was “a fairly recent event ” he said He said that officials don’t believe this case was linked to the bizarre case of Dennis Ray Jackson who was apparently killed  dismembered  and set on fire last fall  Parts of Jackson’s body were found burning in November in a barrel near the Bridgewater state prison complex  and behind an industrial building in Boston’s Hyde Park section “We don’t feel they’re linked because of some particular facts of our case ” he said Anybody with information that might help the investigation can contact police at 508 790 5799  he said  Jim Laughrea  who said he lives about a half mile from where the body was discovered  said two Sandwich police officers came to his home Thursday at about 8 30 a m  to ask if he had any surveillance cameras on his home He said there was a gathering on the

called the employee into his office and told him there would be no more yelling or screaming and no more need to be mean   He has heard back that the employee now tells colleagues  “We’re nice to people now  The mayor wants us to be nice to people ” nThe moral of the story  There’s a new sheriff in town  and he differs in style from the old one “I have a different mindset  I want to bring a different culture  I want people to enjoy going to work every day and to do a good job on behalf of the taxpayers of Boston  I don’t think you have to do it by fear ” Walsh said during breakfast at McKenna’s in Dorchester earlier this week In case you missed it  “fear” was a reference to Walsh’s predecessor  Tom Menino  Of course  he respects Menino  said Walsh  preaching niceness — before executing a delicate jab  The public loves Menino  but some insiders who witnessed the force of his will over time are less enthralled with his management legacy  But criticizing him is sensitive  given his popularity  health issues  and higher than expected profile as mayor emeritus On one hand  Menino chose not to attend Walsh’s swearing in  On the other  the new mayor and the ex mayor have been sharing the stage more than anyone anticipated  Walsh has been gracious about it  but asked about the many events   he said  “I can tell you this  when I am done with being the mayor of Boston  I’m gonna retire   u2009  u2009  I’m gonna let the next mayor do the job  You can’t have two mayors ” nFive months into it  Walsh is thrilled with a job few predicted he would win  “I love it ’’ he said  “It’s everything and more than I ever thought ”For Walsh  part of the thrill is reveling in the distance he traveled  from recovering alcoholic to state lawmaker  and then  improbably  to mayor  He’ll tell you candidly that if he loses his sense of wonder about it all  he runs the risk of losing the humility and humanity that are engaging parts of his persona Walsh still meets with recovery groups and still shares his personal tale of hope and triumph But to be great — and reelected —  a mayor needs more than a compelling life story  Walsh faces plenty of challenges  Can he deliver on diversity  Can he stand up to unions  Can he develop a real vision for Boston’s future  “I think the mayor was always thinking about reelection ” said Walsh of Menino  “I’m not thinking about reelection  It’s too early  I’m doing my job  When the time for reelection comes around  if I did my job  I’ll get reelected ”Asked about the “vision thing ” he notes that Banker   Tradesman  “a nice story” that counters the conventional wisdom that he lacks it  Pressed on what his is  however  Walsh ducks  “What’s my vision for Boston for the next 10 years  Who the hell knows ” he said  “I’m not going to lay out a vision  The only vision I’m concerned about is the schools  The schools have to get better  I’m not worried what the Boston skyline is going to look like  Or whether there are cobblestone sidewalks or bricks ”Menino’s attention to detail like that was legendary  No one writes about Boston development  the crownlike structure on the top of 111 Huntington Avenue  plopped there because the former mayor didn’t like flat rooftops  A post Menino definition of vision would also be nice from a mayor who is committed to bringing a post Menino niceness to city government',

described business successes and regulatory woes Most manufacturers in the state are small  said Baker  who plans to spend this week focused on the needs of small businesses  which account for about 98 percent of all employers in Massachusetts  according to federal government statistics  t n“I want people to see that there’s more to Massachusetts than education  health care  and biotech ” Baker said outside the pressed metal company  the sound of massive machines cutting metal nearly drowning him out “There’s still a significant amount of manufacturing in Massachusetts  and watering it ought to be one of the things we think about in respect to our economic policy ” he said Baker released several economic proposals yesterday  including increasing the minimum wage to $10 50 an hour and giving small businesses tax credits to offset the wage increase  His proposal also calls for helping low income residents by doubling the state’s earned income tax credit On Monday morning  Baker visited two Mattapan businesses  Brothers Deli and Restaurant and Auto Service and Tire  In the afternoon  he stepped into Abas Leather Accessories in Worcester  the city where Democrats will gather

we used to make 85 000 products a week ” Devaney said  “This floor used to house 180 people  Today  the whole floor is vacant ”About 25 more employees will be hired to ramp up for the holiday season  he said  adding that the company  which was hurt by cheaper overseas labor costs  has the capacity to do 25 percent more than it is manufacturing  “if we could get a fair price ’’ Devaney said Throughout the building  dyed alligator  goat  and calf hides rested in bundles on shelves or over railings not far from the finished products  royal blue iPad cases  green cellphone cases  bright orange credit card holders  and pink wallets  On the second floor  machines cut out the pieces that would become baseball gloves  some custom made and emblazoned with logos of college teams Although much of the stitching and cutting of the leather is automated  people must ensure those things are done in a precise manner  so lines are not crooked  worker Larry Johnson said  People assemble the pieces  checking the quality of the raw material and finished product “Every piece is unique ” said Devaney  “The people are really skilled  If there was just some formal way to bring this type of industry back ”Twelve miles away in Westborough  Baker toured a completely different type of factory  where officials say they are concerned with state regulations impeding their ability to compete on a larger scale  Large machines at Carlstrom Pressed Metal Co  Inc  cut metal into everything from parts for HVAC systems to English muffin tins to rowing machine rails to church offertory plates The company  which has about 16 employees  was founded in 1950 by the grandfather of its president  David Carlstrom As he showed Baker the facility and some of its original products  including the metal plate for an iron and a part for a large scale weapon  Carlstrom said his wish is for a governor who can ease and streamline the permitting process that often impedes manufacturers from expanding or moving to Massachusetts “Our neighbors built down in Kentucky ” he said referring to RKW Dana Films  which considered expanding its plant in Westborough but did not  What would have taken about six months in Massachusetts to get all the paperwork approved  happened almost instantaneously there  said Carlstrom and RKW Dana Films’ plant manager Clark Sylvester “The permitting stuff hurts us ” Carlstrom said  “        If there’s one thing I want from the next governor  it’s to make a state that’s business friendly  that we can compete on a global scale  If Boeing or Honda is looking to

was a British dancer on a beach in Beirut  being carried out of the water in the arms of a hirsute Lebanese man   At least he could have been Lebanese  Fujiwara knows nothing about him  beyond what he looks like  and even that’s a memory “Studio Pietà  King Kong Komplex  ” a sly video installation in “Simon Fujiwara  Three Easy Pieces ” at the Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts at Harvard University  begins with the artist’s memory of that lost picture  and nimbly reveals a web of belief systems and power structures  Fujiwara comically and sometimes disturbingly unpacks assumptions about gender  skin color  and sex  t nIn each of the works in this show — the first mounted by new Carpenter Center director James Voorhies — Fujiwara uses himself or his past as a prism through which to view epic societal tensions  Autobiographically  he has plenty to work with  His mother is British and his father is Japanese  he grew up in England  and lives and works in Berlin He sets out to re create the snapshot  The video projection unspools surrounded by the trappings of a photo studio — lights  a mound of sand on the floor to suggest a beach  Fujiwara hires actors  Lisa and David  to play his mother and her companion  We never see the artist  although we hear his voice Fujiwara is clearly attracted to David  and the scene develops an electric charge  The camera lingers on David and Lisa as they meet  kiss  and begin to strip down  and the artist  who interviews himself throughout in an audio commentary  falls silent  as if riveted To flip the power dynamic  Fujiwara asks Lisa to carry David  with the help of bolsters suspended on trapezes  he’s a big guy   and we learn about the “King Kong Komplex ” a cultural fear of darker skinned or hairy figures  appearing through art history from Pompeii to Japanese manga The image of Lisa holding David looks simply goofy  the stereotypes are too rigid for it to have any deeper meaning  Indeed  Fujiwara deems the whole photo shoot a failure — the actors look stiff  The installation  however  is a crafty success Across from the video projection  Fujiwara has posted photographic fractions of Michelangelo’s Pietà  in which Mary holds Jesus’ dead body in her arms  These little glimpses return us to maternal love  For a moment  that’s comforting  until you remember the context of sex and power that surrounds it In another piece  “Rehearsal for a Reunion  with the father of pottery  ” Fujiwara scripts a visit he had with his father after years apart  adding his own  symbolic ending  As he utilizes material from his own life for his art  he shows us how unstable and slippery autobiography is  Every memory  every encounter  is a pastiche of beliefs and hopes  different for each individual but steeped in cultural expectations We humans hungrily grab at truth  reality  and meaning  Exposing the dynamics of desire  power  and symbolism  Fujiwara leaves us hanging  uncertain of what the truth is  And maybe — if I may  here  compulsively apply meaning — it’s only in the experience of knowing that we grasp just how insubstantial reality is  nArt objectifies the body  So does medicine  It’s not often that the two come together  “Performing Illness ” a compelling show at Howard Art Project  features the work of three artists who manage chronic illness Suzi Grossman and Rosie Ranauro have fibromyalgia  and map their pain on their bodies  In drawings and photographs  Grossman uses watercolor  colored pencil  and thread to mark where it hurts “31 Pain Maps  1 1 2014 1 31 2014” makes a calendar of the data  with red marks flowering and contracting over her back  chest  and face  In the photos  she stands in front of a patterned curtain that echoes her feminine shape and the inscriptions of her pain  as if the outside world reflects her inner one  For “Mark the X Where Your Face Hurts ” she has stitched little Xs along her jaw and toward her nose  Patterns on her skin look like ritual markings  scarification or tattoos — marks of distinction  Yet in real life what they symbolize is hidden   Ranauro’s figure drawings and animations also show little red paths of pain  but her postures are more expressive  like that of a dancer  and in “hold it together ” her usual single figure explodes into a tangle of limbs  like she’s trying to cover herself  Her interactive video animation “Touch Me  Gently ” invites viewers to tap a huddled figure  when you do  she trembles — creating an unnerving dynamic  You might want to soothe her  but you always cause her pain Jodie Mim Goodnough was misdiagnosed with bipolar disorder and put on lithium for 14 years  She’s also taken anti depressants for chronic fatigue  In her video “36 835 ” she sits on a bed counting out the number of pills she has consumed over the years  The performance took more than nine hours  She gives us a taste of what “chronic” means Patients  like artists  have to express something inchoate if they hope to move

exchanging “I dos” with verdant Dean College as a backdrop Summer once meant dormant dorms  lonely lecture halls  and quiet quads  But increasingly college campuses in New England and beyond are abuzz between commencement and Labor Day  t n“It’s stunning  There’s just so much activity now ” said Richard Doherty  president of the Association of Independent Colleges and Universities in Massachusetts  There is  of course  educational programming  including an abundance of offerings for middle and high school students  including those from abroad  But local campuses also host conferences  outdoor festivals  flea and farmers markets  recreational camps  and sports clinics  along with cheerleading  music  fitness  and dance classes The activities generate revenue for campuses and can pay off years later if summertime programming participants decide to enroll “A lot of it is a philosophy that if we can get kids onto a college campus  it introduces that aspirational feeling into their lives ” Doherty said  “It allows them to see their future ”Although colleges have long sought to energize campuses during the slow period  beyond summer school for their own students  many institutions have now transformed into year round hubs of activity  t nAssumption College a year and a half ago began exploring ways to boost summer activities  said Francesco C  Cesareo  president  n“Our summers were very  very quiet ” Cesareo said  “We had lots of facilities that could be put to use ”This summer  Assumption debuted a summer semester for local college students and programs for international high school students  including multiweek programs in which students from Argentina  Japan  and China live and learn on campus There are also football  lacrosse  and soccer clinics the school has been hosting for years “I went into the dining hall the other day  and it looked like a normal day during our academic year ” Cesareo said  Overall  he estimated  the college drew more than $500 000 in additional revenue this summer “It’s an important financial piece as we look for new areas to generate revenue ” he said  “It’s also a very important recruitment tool ”Last summer  the college introduced an academic camp for high school seniors  Four of its participants will start as freshman at Assumption this fall High school students who take summer classes at a college campus may become more attractive postsecondary candidates overall  But area college administrators say the offerings do not necessarily boost a student’s chances of being accepted to that school In addition to hosting weddings  Dean College in Franklin plays host to business executives who plot strategy at company retreats Endicott College in Beverly has been hosting summertime programming for more than 20 years  said Eileen Geyer  director of event and conference services The campus attracts unique events  Members of the College of Piping in Glasgow have visited for a weeklong instructional program the past two summers  And for the past five summers  Endicott has raised money for student scholarships by drawing thousands to a weekend event on the college’s dazzling seaside grounds that features rare and vintage automobiles and motorcycles  fashion shows  a fancy hat competition  and art exhibits “We have such an eclectic variety  whether it’s culture and music  sports  academic based  adult learners  international students  or corporate events ” Geyer said Some colleges run programming to strengthen ties with alumni and other donors The alumni gatherings at Colby in Waterville  Maine  often attract individuals who are decades past their college days  Alumni pay a registration fee and do not receive credit  but they are able to experience the campus again from the student perspective  said Colby spokesman Jacob McCarthy  and “hopefully  it will recharge their connection with the college ” nSuch efforts can also can also bolster town gown relations and foster relationships with neighboring entities that may offer internship and career opportunities Roxbury Community College partnered with local organizations to host its first annual “Roxbury Rocks” music festival last weekend  featuring live music  dance performances  and food trucks  “Some of these events are to encourage students to learn more about the college and the environment so they might think about Roxbury as a a place to go to school ” said Valerie R  Roberson  college president  nThe College of the Holy Cross teamed up with the city of Worcester to bring summer baseball back to campus this year  two years after the former independent league franchise  the Worcester Tornadoes  shut down  The new home team  the Worcester Bravehearts  a squad made up of college players  draws local families during June  July  and August  On Friday nights  fireworks light up the sky above the 2 000 seat campus stadium Campus administrators cite few downsides to the increased activity  although scheduling maintenance and construction projects  most of which has historically been saved for summertime  can be a bit more challenging Staff who may have grown accustomed to the more laid back pace of summer are busier  but not overta   said Cesareo  the Assumption president  “I think it actually keeps a level of energy going on the campus ” he said  Plus  “there still is a little relaxing down

Lottery cash register Van Hua dropped the money and went to her fallen husband “Why you shoot my husband ” she cried The gunman ignored her and picked up the strewn cash  He ran out with $300 Danny called 911  With great effort  Chang rose to his feet  then collapsed again “They kill my husband ” Van Hua shouted into the phone  “They kill my husband ”Van Hua  whose English is not as good as her husband’s  held the phone to Chang “Help ” he said through gritted teeth  “I need an ambulance ”As he lay there  listening as the sirens drew nearer  Chang Ly vowed he would not die  Not like this  He had come too far  survived more than almost anyone knew Almost 40 years ago  when the Vietnam War ended  Chang Ly’s father had to disappear before the Viet Cong made him disappear  His father was in the special forces of the South Vietnamese Army  and he was good as dead if the communists found him So he left his wife  his oldest son Chang  and two other boys in a rural part of Soc Trang province A few years after his father left  it became obvious to Chang Ly that he had to step up  to be the man of the house  a house that had no electricity or running water  And so he quit school and went into the waters of the Mekong Delta  to gather rice and reel in fish He was 11 years old Chang’s father made it to Cambodia  then walked to Thailand  Eventually  he made it all the way to Boston and found work as a cook at the Museum of Fine Arts Chang was 18 when he learned his father was in Boston  He had to find him  He paid to get on a boat with 73 other refugees  They were at sea for three days when their boat was taken and sunk by pirates who stripped the refugees of whatever they had  then pushed them  one by one  into the sea “I had nothing of value ” Chang said  “So I was the first thrown into the ocean ”It was pitch black and he drifted for hours  When dawn came he scanned the horizon  There were no boats nearby  he grew exhausted and despondent “I was so tired I wanted to die ” he said  “I tried to swallow water and kill myself  But I couldn’t ”In the midst of his despair  a Thai fishing trawler’s net brought him in  At first  the fishermen tried to force him back into the water  Then someone above  in an authoritative voice  ordered him brought onboard “They gave me food and some medicine ” Chang said  “They gave me water  I slept  And the next day they threw me back into the ocean ”He floated for another day before another Thai fishing boat plucked him from the ocean  Those fishermen were considerably nicer  A few days later  a Vietnamese boat pulled alongside and the Thai fishermen helped Chang to get onboard According to a United Nations report  Chang and another man were the only ones of the original 74 refugees attacked by pirates who survived “We ended up in Malaysia ” Chang said From there  it was a series of refugee camps before he made a series of flights that ended at Logan Airport  His father was waiting for him  and they hugged tightly  Then Chang climbed into an automobile for the first time in his life  He was 19 years old Chang began taking English classes  taking the MBTA downtown  He couldn’t read English  but he could count  It was seven stops on the Red Line from Fields Corner to Park Street He had to pay back the $700 airfare that brought him to America and was desperate to find work  But first he had to find a trade He tried cooking at a restaurant  but didn’t like the heat  He wanted to become a machinist but couldn’t do the math  having left school so young  Then he enrolled in a carpentry training program  and it fit  He got his first job doing building maintenance at the Academy Homes housing project in Roxbury In 1994  he married Van Hua  a seamstress  They bought a house in the Port Norfolk section of Dorchester and started a family  In 1997  he struck out on his own  first as a handyman  He grew ambitious and began buying houses to fix them up He bought a 10 unit building at the corner of Dorchester Avenue and Romsey Street in Savin Hill and put a convenience store on the bottom floor  in part to give his wife a place to work  He called it D D  using the first letter of his kids’ names In the 15 years he and his wife have run D D Convenience  it has closed for only two days  once for his oldest son’s 10th birthday  the other time when the entire family drove up to New Hampshire to a water park The store is open from 8 a m  to 8 p m   seven days a week  365 days a year  Van Hua works behind the counter  Chang helps out in the morning and  after tending to his construction projects  in the evening  before he and his wife drive home to Canton  where his parents live with them and their four kids It’s been a hard life  but a good one  Then came Election Day  and the masked man with the gun  nWithin hours of Chang’s shooting  police arrested Jarris Charley  who is from Roxbury and  at the relatively young age of 21  quite familiar with jail cells and courtrooms The shooting  just a few blocks from the mayor’s home  was especially senseless  Customers couldn’t understand why anyone would shoot Chang  He is the kind of guy who eats the difference if you’re a buck short  Everybody in Savin Hill likes Chang Chang got lucky  The bullet passed through without hitting any organs About 12 hours after her husband was shot  while he was still lying in Boston Medical Center  Van Hua turned the key at D D and opened for business  At the same time  Chang’s kids showed up at school — his oldest boy to pharmacy college  his only girl to Fontbonne Academy  Danny to BC High  the 5 year old to kindergarten  n“This is why I work so hard ” he told me  “I want my kids to get the education I couldn’t ”Less than 24 hours after he was shot  Chang walked out of the hospital and into his store  He was in pain  but wanted to check on the store and drive home with his wife This week  still wincing in discomfort  Chang went back to his full routine  nAs he chatted with a customer at the

neighborhoods “We need to give people in Dudley the chance to understand what the tech and innovation economy can be for them ” Walsh said in an interview  “We have to make sure wealth is shared  so people who grew up in Roxbury can come back and invest there ”So far  private developers and investors have been  following investments by the city and nonprofits   nProponents say Dudley   given its stock of developable lots  an MBTA bus hub  and proximity to institutions such as Northeastern University  It is on a short list of neighborhoods being considered by the city as the site of a second innovation district  a designation that would kick off an intensive planning process to repeat the success of the Seaport area Dudley compares favorably to Kendall Square and the Innovation District in one important measure  Rents here are much lower than those in tech hubs “Because of the hot real estate market  you’re going to have a base of entrepreneurs who are priced out of Kendall and the Innovation District ” said Julie Wagner  a nonresident senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who has   “That gives  Dudley  some real hope ”The biggest challenge  Wagner said  will be creating a vibrant business ecosystem around the innovation center — no easy task  Entrepreneurs want to be around others who share their ambitions and lifestyle  but someone has to be the first to set up shop  They also want coffee shops  restaurants  nightlife  and supermarkets  but those ancillary businesses typically do not anticipate demand  they follow it “It’s a little chicken and egg ” said Christopher Jones  an MIT trained nuclear scientist who runs the nonprofit community development organization   “There are a number of necessary pieces  and the innovation center is just one of them ”Wagner said one way to jump start a cluster would be to lure an anchor tenant for the neighborhood  such as an outpost of a major university or corporation  That would raise Dudley’s profile and increase the pool of potential entrepreneurs Efforts to create a tech cluster in Dudley will get a boost if the  chooses it over other neighborhoods  such as Fields Corner and Uphams Corner  The committee’s selection  due by the end of the year  will recommend zoning tweaks and other steps the city should take to promote the winning neighborhood and will lay out a checklist of “ingredients” that helped make tech clusters successful in other cities “Entrepreneurs want to run into each other at the coffee shop ” said John Barros  the city’s chief of economic development and the committee’s co chair  “They need people nearby who can create apps  do marketing  and take on legal issues  They need talent  and they need people willing to fund their ideas  Strategically coordinating all those pieces will be huge ” nThe city this month will choose a day to day operator of the Bolling Building’s innovation center  A spokeswoman for Walsh said several experienced incubator operators  individuals  and nonprofits had applied  In line with the wishes of residents  applicants will be evaluated on the strength of their plans to work with the neighborhood “Unlike the Innovation District  this a community where families have lived for generations ” said Gilad Rosenzweig  who founded the Smarter in the City tech accelerator near Dudley  “We need to preserve that sense of identity ”One startup at Smarter in the City is working on a feature that would let shoppers browse clothing stores in Dudley using a mobile app on their phones — an example of the collaboration Barros would like to see repeated throughout Dudley Rosenzweig’s first crop of five startups is thriving  One received substantial funding from an angel investor and another won acceptance to the prestigious MassChallenge accelerator “We’re proving it was the right move ” Rosenzweig said  “I have people coming here for meetings who would never come to Dudley before  venture capitalists  lawyers  angel investors  bankers  It’s beautiful ”Still  Rosenzweig said  conversations with some potential investors revealed Dudley is still battling “misperceptions” based on its past  He called on City Hall to give Dudley a marketing push like the one given to the Innovation District But Jones wonders if too much polishing would bend the agenda away from lifting up current residents  Dudley should aspire to be more than a catchment for the Innovation District’s leftovers  Jones said  homegrown talent  nourished by improved public schools  should take the lead “If this thing isn’t inclusive  it isn’t

nCannon  33  offered testimony Tuesday at a public hearing at the State House in support of a sweeping bill to toughen the state’s gun laws  The measure  unveiled last week by House Speaker Robert A  DeLeo  contains more than 40 provisions that include expanding police discretion of a person’s “suitability” to own a gun and stepping up scrutiny of private sales A large contingent of gun rights activists pushed back against the bill at the packed hearing before the Joint Committee on Public Safety and Homeland Security  saying that the bill infringes upon the rights of lawful gun owners and that it will not reduce crime  Many of the few hundred in the audience wore stickers or carried signs in support of advocacy groups Representative George Peterson Jr   Republican of Grafton and the assistant House minority leader  said the bill gives an impression that lawful gun owners are the problem  rather than aiming at street crime  In particular  he criticized the clause that would give police discretion to deny a permit for a rifle or a shotgun if an applicant is deemed unsuitable “I have never committed a crime  I have never been treated for a mental illness  I have never been treated for alcoholism ” Peterson said  “But I might  under the way this bill is proposed  be ineligible because I don’t know what the suitability standards will be ”He asked for a standard defined in

something that has been so widely abused is simply unconscionable ” he said  “The burden must be on a public official who wants to remove my civil rights ”Wallace urged the Legislature to revisit the bill  which he said was not nearly hard enough on street crime  He supported parts of it  such as having Massachusetts join a national database for criminal and mental health background checks Attorney General Martha Coakley told the panel that the bill addresses the critical intersection of many issues  gun violence  suicide prevention  mental health care  domestic violence  and school safety “The fact that we’ve seen tragedy after tragedy and yet the federal government has still failed to pass a federal assault weapons ban or any firearms legislation on the national level is unfathomable ’’ said Coakley  who is seeking the Democratic nomination for governor State Treasurer Steven Grossman  a Democrat who is also running for governor  also spoke in favor of the bill  “Gun laws save lives ” he said The bill could be the most comprehensive update to state gun laws in 16 years  DeLeo has said gun violence prevention cannot be put on hold while awaiting federal action  citing the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting as a catalyst for the legislation  DeLeo has said he hopes for final passage of the bill by the end of the legislative session July 31

sick time ballot measure on Tuesday  these workers will no longer have to choose between taking care of themselves — or their children — and paying the bills  Nearly 1 million workers in the state who — including part time and  temporary employees — will start accruing an hour of sick time for every 30 hours worked   starting July 1   nCompanies with 11 or more employees will be required to give workers up to 40 hours of paid sick time a year  those with fewer workers must offer unpaid sick time  Only two other states  including Connecticut and California  require employers to offer sick time  Sixteen cities  including three passing ballot measures Tuesday  also have sick pay mandates But it is a growing movement that has brought sick time benefits to more than 9 million workers   more than triple the number a year ago  “More and more people  I think  are realizing that  ‘Even if I have paid sick days  it impacts me if the person who makes my sandwich or the person who drives my

sick days and family leave insurance  “A minimum wage earner without paid sick days is a sub minimum wage worker because of that docking of pay ”The approval of sick pay measures was part of a wider show of support for low wage workers in the midterm elections  Voters in four states and three cities passed minimum wage raises for more than 600 000 workers  In two states  voters approved  initiatives telling legislators to raise the minimum wage  Only one minimum wage increase  in Eureka  Calif   failed   nEven with the additional workers covered by the recently passed ballot measures  about a third of the private sector workforce nationwide doesn’t have paid sick time  Industry groups in Massachusetts  where the minimum wage will soon be the highest in the country  say the

fell to a hush At 2 49 p m  Tuesday  exactly one year after two bombs exploded near the Marathon finish line on Boylston Street  the city observed the occasion with a moment of silence  remembering the lives lost and irrevocably changed that April day  nAs church bells tolled  some people stopped in place and lowered their head in prayer  Across from the State House  Steve Rogan looked out over Boston Common “I came here to hear as much as I could ” the 36 year old Bridgewater resident said  “to be at the heart of Boston ”Earlier in the day  Rogan had walked down Boylston Street to the finish line  On the anniversary of the bombings  it was good to take time to remember  he said Not far away at Faneuil Hall  Kelly McGraw stood with her family in an open doorway  She wanted to hear the bell when it tolled in the tower of the red brick Colonial landmark McGraw and her husband came to Boston with their three children for a week’s vacation  They planned to catch a game at Fenway Park and visit the John F  Kennedy Presidential Library   Museum  They also wanted to join the city in observing a moment of silence  n“We want to be able to hear the bell to honor the victims and pay tribute ” said McGraw  who lives in Oneonta  N Y As the bells began to toll  a group of high school students from Quebec quieted  and passersby paused  The McGraw family stood still in the doorway  letting the sound wash over them “I thought about what it must have sounded like  the blast last year ” McGraw said  “I was picturing the mayhem as I looked out here at the peace and quiet ”At South Station  about two dozen travelers gathered around the Tavern in the Square to watch a memorial ceremony on the restaurant’s televisions  creating an island of quiet reflection in the middle of the

Katrina Scott paid homage to the “many strangers who reached out to others in kindness ”“We hold you in our hearts ’’ the audience replied “For all those hurt and wounded ’’ Scott read As the string trio played  naudience members clasped their hands and bowed their heads “For all who ran toward danger ’’ Scott read “We thank you for your courage ’’ the audience replied Other speakers read from

Sean Collier  the MIT police officer who was fatally shot  allegedly by the bombers Hend Eid  a Quincy resident who attended the event  said she felt sad on the anniversary  but heartened that the

River at MIT  Helen Samuels pulled open the chapel’s heavy front door  pausing in the doorway to fold up her umbrella “I just thought this was the right place to be ” she said to no one in particular Samuels  a retired member of the MIT staff  came to the chapel to observe the moment of silence  bowing her head just a hundred feet away from the spot where Collier was killed days after the bombings “I still can’t understand how it could have happened — that day is so joyous and so special ” she said of Patriots Day  the day the Marathon is held  “It’s still surreal  and so discordant with what that day is really about ”When the appointed minute arrived  the chapel bell tolled three times  a dissonant  eerie sound that carried across campus Outside  a dozen students stood silent In Dorchester  the First Parish Dorchester Unitarian Universalist church tolled its 120 year old bells for more than five minutes  as fourth graders from the Mather Elementary School stood by When the moment of silence passed  they rushed inside to speak with the pastor  the Rev  Arthur Lavoie  about how the attacks had affected them  One of them spoke about a family friend who lost two fingers and a leg in the attacks  Another described a loved one whose nose was burned They all tried to understand what could make someone do such a thing “I always ask myself why did they do this ” said 10 year old Kareena Tahsir  “Did they think it was fun ”“Scripture says you have to forgive anyone who does something wrong to you ” said 10 year old Mike Spears “That’s true ” Lavoie responded gently  “But that’s not always easy to do ”“It’s never easy ” Spears replied quickly Lavoie asked the children to pray quietly for a minute  Some shifted in their seats impatiently  But Spears bowed his head so deeply it nearly touched his knees As he left the church  he said he had forgiven the bombers On Boston Common  most people rushed through the rain and gusting wind  But one woman near Park Street

enabling an intensity of development that isn’t possible in places where residents are handcuffed to their cars  But trains can also break neighborhoods  because gentrification often comes hitched to the back of a rail car  If a city greets new transit with indifference  the most vulnerable residents around a new station don’t stand a chance of remaining in their neighborhood  Boston is facing that dynamic because subway like rail service will soon come to the Fairmount Line  The city is scrambling to find a way to harness the Fairmount’s economic potential without triggering runaway gentrification   t nBoston’s dance with the Fairmount hinges on a pair of vacant  city owned industrial properties  which hit the market this summer  They are the first of hundreds of publicly owned development parcels that should be sold  and redeveloped  in a big anti gentrification effort along the line  But the properties will only really matter if the city  neighborhood residents  and outside developers can all agree to go big enough to make a real difference  The city owns the old in Mattapan and the former in Dorchester  Cote Ford  an old car dealership surrounded by Jersey barriers and cracked asphalt  sprawls on Cummins Highway  just up the street from Blue Hill Avenue and Mattapan Square  The Maxwell property is three acres of derelict industrial buildings north of Uphams Corner in Dorchester  Both sites should be crying out for redevelopment  But both slid into city ownership  and have sat idle  because there haven’t been many developers willing to build something of consequence on the outskirts of Uphams Corner or Mattapan Square The Fairmount Line  which runs directly behind both sites  changes everything  The line connects Hyde Park  Mattapan  and Dorchester with South Station  It puts neighborhoods that rank among the city’s poorest  and that have been saddled with some of the city’s worst commutes  a quick ride away from both downtown Boston and the emerging Newmarket industrial hub  Several refurbished stations opened along the Fairmount Line over the past two years  but the real revolution will come over the next few years  when the MBTA begins  The new diesel coaches are essentially  And when the Cote Ford and Maxwell sites are suddenly steps away from rapid transit stations  their value  and potential  will soar  The whole idea behind the Fairmount Line is to bring economic activity to the streets that surround the train tracks  Rising property prices should be an indication that the rail line has created something people want to be a part of  But that’s only if the trains are helping to create wealth in neighborhoods instead of just importing it and pushing aside existing residents in the process  And    gentrification and displacement tend to follow closely behind transit expansion projects  More than any other local transit expansion  the Fairmount has the potential to be uniquely gentrification proof  That’s because the city owns an enormous amount of real estate along the line  That real estate will soon be unloaded rapidly  The city hopes to turn 200 small vacant parcels into one   two   and three family homes containing roughly 400 housing units  So even without releasing any sizable parcels  the city can make a big push on affordable homeownership along the Fairmount  If done right  Cote Ford and Maxwell have the potential to amplify these smaller efforts  They could become large wells of mi  income housing  perched atop vibrant new storefronts  They should be new hubs of activity  and affordability  at stations that are poised suddenly to become main streets  The city is doing its part by selling the parcels at a time when they can do some good  Now it’s up to residents to line up behind projects big enough to blunt the gentrification that the Fairmount Line enables', '2014_313')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('It’s called “The Gambler ” but any similarity to Karel Reisz’s 1974 film starring James Caan ends there  The updated version  opening here on Christmas  is helmed by British director Rupert Wyatt with a screenplay by Dorchester born writer William Monahan and a big name cast led by Mark Wahlberg  “Karel Reisz is underappreciated  I loved ‘Who’ll Stop the Rain ’ u200a” says Wyatt  referring to the Czech born British director’s 1978 film  “I knew James Toback  who wrote the 1974 script  and I like his documentaries  but I didn’t want to have anything to do with the original film  I don’t have Toback’s gambling history and  the 1974 film  was based on Toback’s life  I wanted to come at it from a different perspective   t n“I saw it as aspirational ” Wyatt said recently in Boston  where he was promoting the film  “It’s not about addiction the way the original is  Bill wrote about a guy who uses gambling as a way to get out of the gilded cage he finds himself in  It’s actually hopeful ”Wahlberg plays Jim Bennett  a college professor of literature whose gambling obsession takes him from high stakes poker tables to underground betting in Los Angeles’s Korea town  To pay his debts  he borrows money from his wealthy mother  Jessica Lange  and a colorful loan shark  John Goodman   Taking another personal risk  his life is further complicated by a relationship with one of his students  Brie Larson   With a strong indie debut  the British prison thriller “The Escapist”  2008   starring Brian Cox and Damian Lewis  and a big studio hit  “Rise of the Planet of the Apes”  2011   to his credit  Wyatt was well positioned for his next project  “I could have done anything I wanted in terms of the tentpole world  but that’s not what I wanted to do ” he says  “I started to read others’ scripts  Bill’s came along and I fell in love with it  Like ‘Apes ’ I knew how to find my way into the story  Mark came with the project  so that was great ”It was Irwin Winkler  who produced the 1974 film  who brought the idea to Monahan  who won an Oscar for adapting “The Departed”  2006  for Martin Scorsese  Monahan  who lives on the North Shore  prides himself on providing his own angle  a “fresh start” to movie adaptations  “The Departed ” after all  bears little resemblance to its source  the 2002 Hong Kong thriller “Infernal Affairs ” So it’s little surprise that he dismisses Toback’s grousing in the press that “The Gambler” is neither a sequel nor a proper remake “The Toback film came out when I was 13  I never saw the whole thing  sports gambling didn’t interest me  When you write adaptations  you have to protect yourself from the original and anything that might be successful in it ” he says  “I don’t want to be unkind  but ‘The Departed’ came out less than a decade ago and won four Oscars  It takes a special kind of guy to still be talking about something he wrote 45 years ago ” “The Gambler” reunites Monahan with “Departed” star Wahlberg  The pair has also teamed for the upcoming “American Desperado ” which Monahan adapted from the book “American Desperado  My Life — From Mafia Soldier to Cocaine Cowboy to Secret Government Asset” by Evan Wright and Jon Roberts  It’s scheduled for a fall release  “I love this guy and hope to work with him many  many times ” says Monahan Their shared sense of place is undoubtedly part of the attraction  Walhberg is comfortable with Monahan’s vernacular  which is rooted in Boston’s working class Irish  Though the new “Gambler” is set in LA  unlike the ’74 version set on the East Coast  it still reflects Monahan’s ease with lyrical tough talk  “My stock in trade is my ear and that functions wherever I go ” he says  “I was living in LA when I wrote  “The Gambler”   I liked the warm weather but I prefer to be in New England  I went through an LA phase but I could never really be at home there  I’d feel like I was losing my edge ”', '2014_34')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no

proposing to open an ice cream shop in Dudley Square named after Ferdinand himself  nThe Ferdinand Building  a prominent Baroque and Renaissance Revival structure built in the 1880s  is propelling a revival that has been inching along for years  When the restoration is completed next year  the building will become the new home of the Boston Public Schools administration  and six new retail spaces will open on its ground floor An open house last Thursday for retailers vying to fill those spots brought out a range of businesses  including a representative from Starbucks and franchisees for Dunkin’ Donuts and Burger King  Local retailers  such as the Asian restaurant Bon Me and fashion boutique Touch of Class  also came to make their pitches A committee of city officials and neighborhood representatives will select winning bidders from a pool of 22 businesses that made proposals to the Boston Redevelopment Authority  Officials said they were impressed by the turnout and hope to announce the winners within months  in plenty of time for the building’s grand reopening next year In addition to hundreds of school employees who will move into the square — it sits at Boston’s geographic center — Mayor Martin J  Walsh said he is hoping to boost employment in the area by attracting companies from growing sectors like biotechnology “I think there’s an opportunity for light manufacturing and office space ” he said  “If we can create an economy there and jobs and stability  you’re going to see more people in that neighborhood buy homes and invest in their homes ”Earlier this year  a graduate of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology began an effort to open startup space in the square for technology entrepreneurs  The project  named Smarter in the City  still needs funding Change won’t happen overnight  Much of Dudley Square is still suffering from the urban blight that took hold in the 1950s and ’60s  emptying the area of thousands of residents and many of its once popular retailers  Crime  drugs  and poverty are still evident  fueling occasional bursts of street violence The Ferdinand Building closed in the 1970s after years of declining business  It opened in the mid 19th century  and owner Frank Ferdinand expanded over the next two decades  constructing a block long store that became a predecessor — in size and popularity — to the Filene’s Building that would later open downtown A Boston Globe article on the expanded store’s opening celebration in September 1887 reported that guests included “nearly everybody of social and political importance in Roxbury ”Today  business people say its resurrection as a retail mecca is crucial to the broader success of the square  The range of businesses operating there is limited — a few clothing shops  a couple of cellphone stores  take out restaurants  and a Rent A Center  n“If you have players like Tasty Burger  Starbucks  and Parish Cafe  it’s going to get everyone’s attention ” said Darryl Settles  a restaurateur who is proposing an Italian restaurant for the building  “I think it’s going to come together this time ”In addition to the restoration of the Ferdinand Building  a new police station has been built and a public library branch has been refurbished  The area is also home to the MBTA’s Dudley Station  one of the busiest transit stops in the city Several long vacant parcels around the square have attracted bold development proposals  At the former Bartlett bus yard  developers have won approval to build more than 100 residences  a parking garage  and commercial space  A vacant lot on Melnea Cass Boulevard has attracted plans for a Tropical Foods supermarket  stores  and residences Edna Freeman has been waiting to see signs of renewal for more than 60 years  The lifelong Roxbury resident attended the retail open house last Thursday and chatted with business owners she has known for years “It’s good to see that we have a diverse group and a lot of people

to continue to mentor them and help them find paths to success Then they listened to Roderick L  Ireland  the chief justice of the state’s highest court and a longtime member of the church  recall the story of a certain African American boy from the South Side of Chicago who worked his way to became governor of Massachusetts  nIreland and Governor Deval Patrick  the first African Americans to hold their respective positions  headlined a “Men’s Leadership Day” service at Eliot Congregational Church focused on helping African American boys set out on the right path as they become men Three judges from the community  including Ireland  led a responsive blessing as about a dozen boys and teenagers  from age 8 to 17  in the church’s mentorship program stood before the congregation “Lord  give us wisdom to stop the spread of crime  violence  and hate amongst our men ” one of the judges said “God help our young men to be instruments of transformation ” the congregation responded In his remarks  Patrick noted that in policymaking circles  boys such as those who stood before the church are described as being at risk  n“It’s at risk of the ravages of poverty  of violence  of despair  of broken neighborhoods and broken families ” Patrick said  “I’ve been there  I understand that risk ”But  he added  if the larger community  beyond the boundaries of any certain neighborhood  does not internalize the idea that we are all our brothers’ and sisters’ keeper  then we are all at risk “Being in a community is understanding the stake you have in your neighbor’s dreams and struggles as well as your own ” he said to murmurs of “Amen ” from people in the pews Patrick  the second black person to be elected governor in the United States  referenced My Brother’s Keeper   aimed at helping boys and young men of color get ahead  And the service on Sunday highlighted one of a number of  at steering young men away from violence One of the young men blessed by the Eliot community on Sunday was Stephen Reynolds  15  of Everett  who is also part of the church’s mentorship program After the service  Stephen said in a telephone interview it was “really nice” to hear from Patrick  who inspired the young man with his life’s story  He added it has benefited him to have a mentor to stay in touch with as he grows up The Rev  Evan C  Hines  the senior pastor at the church  said the service was held in part to respond to violence in the community that disproportionately affects black men and boys “The senseless killings that take place — we convene a lot of those funerals at Eliot Congregational Church and these are our children  our nieces  our nephews  our sisters and our brothers ” he said in a telephone interview Sunday afternoon “The cry that we so often hear is  ‘Why aren’t our elected officials doing more ’         But we recognize here at Eliot Congregational Church that it is all of our responsibility ” he said  “We have a responsibility to stand up for these young men  to mentor them and to account for them ”While the focus of the service was on the young men  there was also a political bent to Ireland’s remarks  as he hinted that Patrick’s journey might take him to a higher office “He has led our state for the last eight years ” said Ireland  who is retiring next month  “And many of us hope that  someday  he will lead us as president of the United States ”The crowd at the church rose to its feet  applauding and cheering Patrick  who has said he is not running for president in 2016  called Ireland “mischievous” for the remark after taking the podium In an interview following the service  the governor repeated what has become his mantra in recent months  He is focused on being governor and intends to join the private sector after his term ends early next year Yet his speech offered an anecdote that could be heard as having a double meaning Patrick told the story of L  Douglas Wilder  former Virginia governor and the first African American elected governor  introducing him at a breakfast during the 2008 Democratic National Convention “People always make a fuss about my being the first black governor in America ” Patrick recalled Wilder as saying  “Being first doesn’t mean a thing unless there is a second ”Patrick’s point was that it’s important for successful people to pass it forward  to reach out and guide those in younger generations to their own successes  But given Ireland’s introduction  it was hard for some in the audience  including Hines  not to hear a hint of what might come next for the man who was once

other his son — and surveyed the spacious sanctuary of the Mattapan church they helped build At the age of 68  Bishop Gideon Thompson is formally stepping away from the limelight of Jubilee Christian Church  after more than four decades in the ministry  t nHis second son  Matthew K  Thompson  will take over It is a signal moment  this changing of the guard marked last week by a three day succession ceremony  Jubilee has 7 000 members and five worship services at two locations in Mattapan and Stoughton  On Sunday mornings  the church is a main attraction for the city’s young black professionals and middle class families  And many are used to seeing both men preach “It passed by so quickly ’’ the bishop said  reflecting on the past 40 years  “It seems like only yesterday we were all living together ”Pastor Matt  as he is known  pledges to continue his father’s legacy and keep ministering to the faithful  while preserving the church’s vision for economic empowerment for the people it serves “My work speaks for itself ’’ the 41 year old Pastor Matt said  “I’m not huge on tooting my own horn  We are here doing the work and doing it for God ”The men  similar in stature and build  possess a rousing preaching style  The bishop is renowned for stalking the purple carpeted pulpit in a sweeping robe  while weaving a narrative with Scripture The son sometimes delivers sermons while running on a treadmill  demonstrating the hardships of sprinting through life  He tweets his sermons  taking his message to social media Keith Brian Thompson  a worshiper from Roxbury  said Pastor Matt has used more than 100 props on the Jubilee stage to illustrate his sermons  He has used a basketball stand and hoop  a ladder  and a couch — each to showcase the difficulty of overcoming obstacles in life Keith Thompson  who is not related to the bishop and pastor  knew Pastor Matt before he met his new bride  Duquinha Thompson  and the pastor has served as mentor and counselor  The couple said they are thrilled to see the pastor in his new leadership role “I feel proud as a member because I know him personally ” Duquinha said  “I have trust in him as my pastor  and I have trust in his vision for the members of this church ”As Pastor Matt takes charge of the nondenominational church  his father won’t go very far  the men said  The bishop will continue to assist his son and preach some Sunday mornings “My dad is not going anywhere ’’ the pastor said  “He’s still my right hand man ”Worshipers and ministers said the transition of leadership has been seamless  They have long been witness to the close bond between the bishop and his eight children  often displayed in sermons and songs on the stage at Jubilee  And through the years  they have watched the older Thompson groom and nurture Matthew for this pivotal moment “For me  this is very emotional ’’ said Pastor Chris Sumner  a member of the church for 27 years  “To see the bishop humble himself and be led is phenomenal ”Pastor Matt  the third of his parents’ eight children  became involved in his father’s ministries right after graduating from Morehouse College 18 years ago  Through the years  he served as his father’s personal assistant and executive administrator  working behind the scenes on the church’s real estate ventures The bishop’s seven other children all work in the ministry  some as pastors  others as worship leaders  Matt Thompson said at first he resisted what he describes as a calling from God to preach  He had always wanted to help people  but never preach He changed his mind about a decade ago during a trip to North Carolina  while helping his older brother open a church  At the time  he was thankful for his “miracle’’ boy — Thompson and his wife  Mona  had tried to conceive for years before they had their son  Matthew So there he was one day  praying to God and giving thanks for his son  He said he promised to devote that child’s life to God  but heard a call to preach In 2010  after consulting with his father  Thompson began to make the transition  taking on pastoral duties  By 2012  he was the lead pastor Pastor Matt said that while the two share animated preaching styles  he does not try to mimic his father “The other siblings felt the pressure of trying to be like him ’’ said Pastor Matt  who has an older daughter  Tyveshe Fernandes  “I’ve never struggled with that  I look to him for guidance ”Bishop Thompson  his short cropped hair graying  still delivers a biting sermon  He said the lightened workload will allow him to enjoy his older years and free him to preach in other churches  He’s still riding his motorcycle to church on Sundays  still living an adventure  Just two years ago  he went skydiving at age 66 A Philadelphia native  Bishop Thompson and his wife  Yvonne  moved to Boston in 1972  The young couple worshiped in Dudley Square  but by 1989 Bishop Thompson was ready to move on  He bought an old supermarket on Blue Hill Avenue  a stone’s throw from Mattapan Square  Over time  he transformed the church — then called New Covenant Christian Center — into a go to spot on Sunday mornings It is a singing church  with stirring choirs and worship service  and lyrics to joyous songs posted on giant TV screens The church stresses economic empowerment  and through the years its real estate ventures led to job creation for the community  It runs a bookstore  down from three   has a record label  and owns 45 acres of land in Dudley Square  Grove Hall  and at the Hyde Park Roslindale border The pastors said their job is to feed souls and give worshipers the spiritual lift they need to face another week “A lot of preachers see themselves only as trying to bring the lost to Christ  but I have a church full of believers ’’ Bishop Thompson said Pastor Matt said the church’s work is not done At the church recently  the two men crossed a threshold and walked under a massive tent where the succession ceremony would take place Pastor Matt led the way His father quietly followed', '2014_976')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('What the heck was I thinking That’s what I’m wondering as I

Massachusetts Chiefs of Police Association has thrown its support behind the measure  the State Police are considering a pilot program  and municipal departments are working to untangle questions of cost  privacy  and logistics  “There’s a lot of interest in the use of body cameras ” said A  Wayne Sampson  executive director of the police chiefs’ association  “We believe that if there is ever a question of what actually took place  it could be valuable information for the police departments ” t nIn the aftermath of the fatal shooting of Michael Brown  an unarmed black teenager in Ferguson  Mo   by police Officer Darren Wilson  President Obama on Monday proposed spending $75 million to help provide up to 50 000 body cameras for police officers across the country But  Sampson and other law enforcement officials say there are serious issues to be ironed out  Among them  Is it legal for police to record citizens without consent  How would cities and towns pay for the cameras  Would they run constantly  or would officers turn them on and off  Where  and for how long  would the footage be stored  Who could review it  “I think overall it’s a good thing ” said Colonel Timothy P  Alben  superintendent of the Massachusetts State Police  “I’m just concerned about all the collateral issues that go with it ”Alben said he is considering a pilot program with either body cameras or dashboard cameras for about six troopers  The State Police field tested dash cameras about 10 or 15 years ago  he said  but the volume of video footage — stored in those days on DVDs — was overwhelming  and there were concerns about the legality of recording citizens   nThese days  he said  data is easier to store  but still voluminous  and fielding public and media requests for the footage would be a massive undertaking  The department probably would have to negotiate with the unions to introduce the cameras  Alben said  and cameras are expensive  Still  he said  he believes that eventually  cameras are coming “I think that most people today walk around with a smartphone in their pocket or on their belt or in their bag  They’ve all got recording capability wherever they go ” said Alben  “I think the idea of technology expanding into this area — there’s a certain inevitability to that ”The question of the legality of recording by police remains  however   Sampson said the police chiefs’ group intends to file legislation in January that would create a specific allowance for the use of body cameras  Chelsea Police Chief Brian Kyes  who said he hopes to have his officers outfitted with body cameras by the end of next year  said he thinks the tide will soon turn  and many law enforcement departments will want to use cameras  “The premise is that in law enforcement  we have to treat people with respect and dignity ” Kyes said  “We have to  it’s essential  I think that this device kind of furthers that notion ”But not everyone agrees  On Monday  Mayor Martin J  Walsh of Boston said he is not ready to embrace the use of cameras by police  The Boston Police Department released a statement saying that while it is not dismissing the idea of body cameras outright  more details are needed  “Our main concern is that we have developed over the years a great amount of trust and cooperation with the community ” department spokesman Lieutenant Michael McCarthy said in an interview Tuesday  “By injecting a camera  that level of trust can be broken down ”In October  the American Civil Liberties Union recommended that Boston police begin using body cameras after a report showed that black residents were disproportionately observed  interrogated  or searched by police between 2007 to 2010  “When the government can surveil you  but you can’t watch your government  it turns democracy on its head ” said Carol Rose  executive director of the ACLU of Massachusetts The October report was controversial  Police called the data outdated  and said officers focused on high crime areas and individuals with criminal records  not race Rose said that continuously recording cameras would be best  because allowing police to turn cameras on and off allows too much subjectivity in what is captured  Privacy concerns could be alleviated  she said  by automatically deleting footage unless it shows a detention  arrest  or flagged incident “Body cameras on officers can really be a win win situation for both the police and for the public ” said Rose  “If the police officer and the public both know that they have clear notice that their interaction is being recorded  both the police officer and the civilian are likely to behave with much more civility ”Both police and community leaders caution  however  that recording interactions between police and citizens is not a panacea for frayed relations “I’m a little bit cautious in terms of saying that it will restore trust  because I think it will take more than body cameras ” said the Rev  Jeffrey Brown  associate pastor at the Twelfth Baptist Church in Roxbury  “I think that requires a command staff that continues to view the community organizers as partners ”Emmett Folgert  executive director of the Dorchester Youth Collaborative  said the city must focus on job and educational opportunities  and good relationships between officers and citizens  He supports body cameras for police officers in a limited capacity  he said  “But it’s not the answer ” said Folgert  “Community policing is the answer ”', '2014_250')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article',

bought his first real estate listing and described him as a “loyal  genuine  stand up guy” whom people admired “Everyone thought highly of him ” MacDonald said Pelrine’s girlfriend had said she would move in with him only after they were engaged  according to MacDonald  so his proposal coincided with the purchase of an old  two story schoolhouse on Hillsboro Road in Mattapan that had been converted into a family home  There  the two lived with her 9 year old son from a previous marriage  The plan was to renovate the home so that the boy could take piano lessons in one of its rooms  MacDonald said  Pelrine recently bought a piano  said Terry Webster  an ironworker and colleague who helped him move it inside Pelrine also wanted to put in a garage and possibly add more rooms In a recent conversation  Pelrine told MacDonald that he was budgeting money for the renovation and the wedding  There was “excitement in his voice ” MacDonald said  Despite their long friendship  MacDonald always refused Pelrine’s invitations to sky dive  “We joked about my fear of heights  versus his no fear of heights ” MacDonald said MacDonald said Pelrine told him he had made more than 450 jumps  and shared videos he shot during jumps  Webster recalled Pelrine’s love of sky diving in a phone interview Sunday  He said his friend told him he had jumped as many as 10 times in a day “He was always trying to get me to go with him ” said Webster  He said he was shocked and emotional after learning of his friend’s death  Pelrine’s new home was a few doors down from where Webster’s mother  Julie Gonzales  lives After Pelrine moved in earlier this year  he was often in the yard chopping firewood  Gonzales and Webster said Pelrine was a kind man — and a very good ironworker “He was very nice ” Gonzales said  “He showed us all around the house and said we could come back anytime ”Neighbors recalled seeing him play soccer with neighborhood youths at a park nearby In Pepperell on Sunday

always knew she would follow them  She picked Stonehill for its strong education program Along the way to becoming a teacher she became passionate about educational opportunity  and addressing the achievement gap  She read Jonathan Kozol’s “Savage Inequalities” and started thinking about where and whom she wanted to teach “I was lucky enough to get this great public school education  but I realized that people in Bridgeport were not getting that education ” she said  “The more I grew up and learned  the more I thought if I have all this energy and talent for teaching  the place to use it is a place where I can really have an impact  Once I realized I could make a difference I was really committed to working in urban education ”So she’s in Dorchester  a passionate advocate for her students and for charter schools in general “You know what was here  in general  it wasn’t working  and when things aren’t working they need to be fi  ” she said  “I would say I’m pro kid  I’m pro education  Like whatever we can do to educate kids and close that achievement gap  that’s what I’m for ”The school has yet to work out what exactly her gift will be used for  besides the books that have already been promised  Bollerman said she would like for some of it to fund a computer lab for students  There are plenty of good uses for it “They got their wish granted  but there’s a lot of

his honor  while Jack  his mother  Elizabeth  and brother  Matthew  have cheered them on  offering support and words of encouragement along the way   nBut for this weekend’s installment of the annual bike a thon  Jack won’t be on the sidelines  he won’t be holding up a sign or calling out to his father and uncle  he’ll be riding beside them  helping to raise money for adult and pediatric care and research at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute  It will be a  feat that’s not only impressive in that he is a cancer survivor with a prosthetic leg  but also because he is a teenager who will be riding mostly among grown men “It shows strength of character and his determination to accomplish something ’’ and the two day PMC ride “is very hard ” said his father   t n“I mean let alone a 16 year old         anybody to try to go out and ride 192 miles is a tough challenge ”But Jack is willing to tackle any challenge that comes his way  and  npedaling his way from Sturbridge to Provincetown will  pale in comparison with the struggles that he has overcome In 2006  Jack broke his left femur while kicking a ball in a soccer game  After doctors examined the X rays at Norwood Hospital  he was sent to Boston Children’s Hospital  where it was confirmed that he had a tumor in his leg  He was diagnosed with osteosarcoma  a form of bone cancer “It’s devastating to hear that your child has cancer  and it just opens up a world of unknowns ” said Vincent  “Unfortunately there aren’t immediate answers  you’re having to wait hours and days for test results to come back  and so in the meantime  you’re prepping for the worst and hoping for the best ”The diagnosis left Jack baffled and confused  he said  recalling that he “didn’t really understand what it was  I wasn’t thinking it would be anything long term ”He went through three months of chemotherapy  until doctors decided they would have to remove a portion of the leg  They performed rotationplasty surgery  A section of his leg from mid thigh to the shin was removed  and then his left ankle was rotated and attached to his thigh  and now serves as his knee joint He then went through four more months of chemotherapy  before the road to recovery began  After a year of physical therapy  in which he relearned how to walk  run  and maintain balance  Jack returned to the baseball diamond  which served as a haven for him “It definitely shows how strong he is ” said Elizabeth Manning  “He’s always been very competitive since he was little  before he got sick  so it definitely helped him get through this and get back into sports  and be so successful at everything ”Now heading into his junior year at Roxbury Latin School  he serves as a pitcher and third baseman for the Foxes  and plays linebacker for the football squad  He plays town basketball in the winter  is an avid snowboarder  and  of course  has developed a passion for biking Jack began training for the PMC with his father in the early spring  starting off with 10  to 15 mile rides  and has worked his way up from there Billy Starr  founder and executive director of the PMC  says Jack’s perseverance and his family’s compassion perfectly represent what the event is all about “It is a typical story in how the PMC can help elevate everybody’s role in an individual struggle ” said Starr  who established the fund raiser for the Jimmy Fund at Dana Farber  in 1980  “I mean  what could be more normal than to ride your bike  It’s a great statement for Jack to be able to make ”Last year  the PMC raised $39 million  accounting for approximately 60 percent of the Jimmy Fund’s annual revenue Over the last five rides  the Mannings have raised well over $50 000  as of Monday  they were well on their way to meeting this year’s goal of $17 200  according to the Team Jack page on the PMC website Elizabeth says the support “has been amazing  and we’ve been so grateful for it  We just get contributions from people we barely know or don’t know or haven’t heard from in years  and people who can’t afford to give us money ”One of their top supporters on multiple fronts has been Jack’s prosthetist  Mike Amrich  nAmrich has known the family since Jack was diagnosed eight years ago  and rode for the team last summer  He is no stranger to the disease  either  his twin sister  Michele  died of thyroid cancer in 2008  the same illness that his wife Shelagh is currently battling “He is just a really strong minded and just a great kid ” said Amrich  “When I first met him he had no hair  he was a frail small boy         To watch him get stronger and healthier has been great ”Not only did Jack gain back his health and strength  he has served as a mentor to other kids battling similar cancers  On occasion he will travel into Children’s Hospital and speak to patients “Usually they just like seeing what I can do because they’re worried ” said Jack  “But I just tell them that they can do whatever they want  they just have to go through all the steps  The physical therapy is very important ”And now he will further serve as an inspiration  as he takes on the biking challenge on Saturday and Sunday  He will ride on the four member team  along with Dave Kaple  a family friend and triathlete from Arizona  and his uncle and  of course  his father “We’ve looked forward to it the whole year  so I’m glad I can share it with him ” said Jack  “He’s wicked good at it  too  I’m a little nervous he’s going to be way ahead of me  but it’ll be fun ”But his dad will be by his side the whole time  He’s been awaiting this moment  and plans to spend every second of it with him “I can’t wait to watch him experience the PMC through his eyes and just being a part of it ” said Vincent  “For the past four years  he’s been at the rest stops  at the finish line  and helping raise awareness and cheer and support us  but this year he’ll be there  and I just think it’s going to be an energizing and uplifting experience for him         one that I think will have a positive impact on him and everyone around him ”', '2014_706')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article',

down to neighborhoods and parishes and streets and which end of those streets So Tom Menino was from Hyde Park But within our neighborhoods there are smaller neighborhoods So Tom Menino was from Readville I walked around Hyde Park in the hours after news of Menino’s death spread  and it would be great and amazing to tell you that everybody I talked to had met him  Many had  But it was nowhere near that amazing statistic  which his successor  Marty Walsh  noted on City Hall Plaza in paying tribute to Tom  that half of the people in the city had met him at some point during his 20 year tenure as mayor That stat was always misleading  It wasn’t that Tom Menino had met half the people in the city  It’s that he met almost everybody in the city who bothered to vote Most of the people I talked to in Hyde Park are immigrants  They aren’t from Hyde Park  They are Hyde Park  They were exactly the people Tom Menino identified with  those who some might judge for the way they look or the way they talked  Tom Menino didn’t dress like Tom Brady  He didn’t talk like Tom Brokaw The people in Hyde Park talked about Menino like he was one of the few people in this world with real power who actually cared about them as much if not more than he cared about the suits downtown My favorite story in Hyde Park came from a 26 year old waitress named Dawn Martin  Last fall  Tom Menino and his wife Angela walked into the Fairmount Grille on Fairmount Avenue on a quiet Sunday  They were the only customers The then still mayor told Martin he’d like a burger  Angela ordered the pasta Dawn Martin turned to put the order in  but then she turned back “When I was in fifth grade ” she told Tom Menino  “I sang a song for you with my class at the Blackstone School ”Tom Menino  already struggling with his health  sat up in his chair “You know ” Martin continued  “you’re the only mayor I’ve ever known  My whole life ”Tom Menino smiled and looked at his wife “How long have you been waitressing ” he asked Dawn Martin  “I just started ” she replied  “Well ” he said  “you’re very good at it ”It was a small kindness  But it was something Dawn Martin  just a young woman working to get ahead  will never forget  “I’m so sorry he died ” Martin said  “I wished he got a chance to spend more time with his family  He deserved it ”There is the likelihood — nay  a certainty — that Tom Menino’s death will unleash a communal grieving  which is absolutely appropriate  and severe bouts of hagiography  which are not Tom Menino was not a saint  He was a politician  And long before he was a politician  he was a human being  Sometimes he could be vindictive  His feud with the developer Don Chiofaro was positively juvenile  The first Boston mayor of Italian heritage  Tom Menino could sometimes act like a well balanced Irishman  with chips on both shoulders But you should measure a politician against the people he cared about  and Tom Menino cared about those on the fringes  whether they were homeless or poor or living on Bowdoin Street or dying on Blue Hill Avenue Some people made fun of his malapropisms  He told me all that mocking didn’t bother him  but I know it did  Of course  it says more about the bullies who would mock and laugh at him than it says about him  Like all of us  insecurities drove Tom Menino in both directions  but it almost always drove him in the right direction He had enormous empathy for gay people who were ostracized by family or verbally and physically abused by strangers  He was a monitor at Hyde Park High during the desegregation of the city’s public schools in the 1970s  and he detested racists and racism Tom Menino was human and he wasn’t right all the time  but he was almost always on the right side  And that was almost always with those who were  like the physical location of Hyde Park  on the edge  on the fringe  as far removed from the center of power and the center of the city as Readville is from Beacon Hill We all have regrets in our life  One of mine will be that I was supposed to spend last Monday night on the stage at First Parish Church in Cambridge with Tom Menino  talking to him about the memoir he wrote with Jack Beatty It would have been a lot of fun  One of the things I wanted to ask Tom was whether he thought he could have been elected in Cambridge  which is separated from Boston by a river and a lot of stereotypes I’m guessing he would have said yes  that his values would have resonated  that he would have had as much credibility in Central Square and North Cambridge as he did in Cleary Square and the North End  People are people  Values are values We could have had a rap about the irony of sitting in the First Parish Church in Cambridge when it was the First Parish Church in Dorchester where Tom had his first debate as a mayoral candidate in 1993  Last year  in one of his final events as mayor  Tom went back to the First Parish on Meetinghouse Hill and recalled that debate I asked him what he most remembered about that debate  He said there were so many candidates  about a dozen  that it was too crowded  He was sitting next to Rosaria Salerno  one of the candidates  and she moved her chair  nudging him  Being a Hyde Park guy  of course  his chair was on the edge of the stage“I almost fell off ” he told me  “I coulda died ”And now he has I got a call from somebody last week  saying that Tom’s health was such that he couldn’t do the book event  A day later  we found out that he had decided to stop treatment for his cancer It was classic Tom Menino  Like when  after the Marathon bombs  he got out of bed against a doctor’s advice  He had stuff to do  Tom wasn’t the kind of guy to put off the inevitable  This wasn’t the first time he told doctors  “Thanks  but no thanks ” but it was the last He did things his way  He was like that his whole life  Why would he change at the end He loved the Frank Sinatra version of “My Way ” The Paul Anka version  he could take or leave  Once  over dinner last year at Joe Greene’s place West on Centre in West Roxbury  I encouraged the then still mayor to listen to the Sid Vicious cover Tom put his fork down  turned his attention away from his veal  tilted his head  and gave me that look “Who the heck ” he asked  “is Sid Vicious ”I think Sid Vicious was the only guy who could vote that Tom Menino

one week before the star tight end reported to training camp Daniel Abreu  28  and Safiro Furtado  29  friends who worked together as housekeepers  had a “chance encounter” with Hernandez at Cure  a Theatre District nightclub  that ended with Hernandez shooting the two men to death after they left the club and were waiting at a traffic light on Shawmut Avenue  Suffolk District Attorney Daniel F  Conley said Thursday  n nConley and other officials described Abreu and Furtado as innocent victims  The charges against Hernandez were handed up Thursday by a grand jury “For us  this case was not about Aaron Hernandez ” Conley said  “This case was about two victims  who were stalked  ambushed  and senselessly murdered on the streets of the city they called home ”Conley spoke at a press conference at his office  where he announced the indictments Two of Hernandez’s lawyers  Charles W  Rankin and James L  Sultan  released a statement in response to the charges “Unlike the district attorney  we are not going to try this case in the media ” the statement said  “Under our system of justice  Aaron Hernandez is innocent of these charges  and he looks forward to his day in court ” nHernandez is already jailed  charged with the fatal shooting of a Dorchester man  Odin Lloyd  a year after Abreu and Furtado were killed At the Furtado family home in Dorchester  a cousin  Susan Vicente  said relatives were trying to absorb the news of the charges  “This is a very hard time for all of us ’’ she said   nWilliam T  Kennedy  who is representing the families of Abreu and Furtado in a wrongful death lawsuit against Hernandez  said he doubts the victims even knew Hernandez was a player for the Patriots “Danny and Safiro were just two very good guys who were just trying to make their way in this world ’’ Kennedy said  “These are just a couple of hard working guys who had dreams like any other  They worked together cleaning toilets at the Quincy YMCA ’’It was Lloyd’s shooting that helped Boston police detectives connect Hernandez to the killings of Furtado and Abreu  officials said Investigators knew that Hernandez  24  had been at Cure on July 16  2012  but initially did not pursue him as a suspect because he had left about an hour before the victims  But when news broke about the Lloyd slaying  Boston detectives took a closer look at Hernandez’s moves that night  They studied earlier surveillance camera footage at the club and on the streets According to documents filed in a Connecticut court  video from inside and outside the nightclub shows Hernandez and an acquaintance entering directly behind Abreu and Furtado  Shortly afterward  Hernandez and the other man  identified in court documents as Alexander Bradley  are seen leaving and getting into a silver sport utility vehicle Abreu and Furtado and three of their friends left the club around 2 10 a m   and video shows Hernandez’s silver SUV circling the block as the victims go to their BMW Conley said Hernandez pulled up to the car and began firing a  38 caliber Smith and Wesson at the car  striking Abreu  who was driving  in the chest and hitting Furtado in the head  A third man  who was in the back seat  was shot in the arm but survived  The other two friends jumped out of the car  Bradley has not faced charges for having a role in the slayings Last June  officers tracked down Hernandez’s silver SUV to a house in Bristol Conn   the home of a cousin of Hernandez  officials said  The cousin  Tanya Singleton  was offered immunity in exchange for her testimony  but Conley said she never showed up before the grand jury  She has been charged with criminal contempt of court Singleton is also facing conspiracy and contempt charges in her alleged actions after Lloyd’s killing  Bristol County prosecutors have said she helped an alleged Hernandez accomplice flee and talked about helping another alleged accomplice  She was held for six months in jail and was recently released on bail Singleton’s lawyer  E  Peter Parker  decried the contempt charge  saying Singleton faces a resurgence of breast cancer since her release in January “This is an aggressive and unnecessary prosecution ’’ Parker said  “She has had numerous health setbacks since her incarceration  and her breast cancer is no longer in remission ’’Parker declined to say why Singleton failed to appear before the grand jury Conley did not describe in detail the encounter between Hernandez and the victims in the double homicide At the press conference  he said there were many details of the investigation he could not discuss  but he suggested more would be revealed at Hernandez’s arraignment  which could take place as early as next week Kennedy  the attorney representing the victims’ families  has told the Globe that he believes there may have been words exchanged between Hernandez and his accomplice and the victims’ friends  Kennedy has said he did not know if Abreu and Furtado had any contact with Hernandez that night The survivors of the shooting have told police that they could not remember problems with anyone that night On Thursday  Kennedy described Abreu and Furtado as two young men enjoying a night on the town “They went out with a couple of other fellows         danced with a couple of pretty girls  had a couple of drinks  and  were heading  home ’’ he said Officials would not say whether there is a link between the killings of Abreu and Furtado and that of Lloyd  Officials have not proposed a motive for Lloyd’s killing Lloyd was not at Cure nightclub the night that Abreu and Furtado were shot  but investigators have looked into whether Hernandez believed Lloyd knew something about the shooting and had talked to authorities  the Globe has reported  citing law enforcement officials and court records Lloyd was killed the same weekend he went out with with Hernandez to Rumor  another nightclub in the Theatre District A tipster identifying himself as a security officer at Rumor told police that Lloyd’s killing was directly linked to the unsolved 2012 double killing  According to court documents  the security officer  Sherif Hashem  told police he knew this because “someone accidentally spilled the beans in front of me ”Court documents also showed that there were Boston police officers at Rumor the night Lloyd was there with Hernandez In a motion filed Thursday in Bristol Superior Court  where Hernandez has pleaded not guilty to Lloyd’s murder  one of Hernandez’s lawyers  Sultan  called for Bristol prosecutors to release the names of those Boston officers Jake Wark  a spokesman for Conley  declined to comment on Sultan’s motion or to answer questions about the presence of police officers at the club  including whether they were interviewed by detectives investigating the slayings of Furtado and Abreu A spokesman for District Attorney C  Samuel Sutter declined to comment on whether there is any connection between the killings  nSultan also asked Judge

move that would bring faster and more frequent service to the Fairmount Line and possibly open up a direct train link from Allston to Assembly Square  Governor Deval Patrick said Thursday morning The purchase of the cars  known as diesel multiple units  or DMUs  was just one of a quartet of announcements made in the parking lot of Jubilee Christian Church in Mattapan   t nThe governor also announced the proposed December 2017 opening of a new Blue Hill Avenue Station in Mattapan  weekend hourly commuter rail service on the Fairmount Line starting next month  and the agency’s commitment to keeping the Fairmount commuter line’s fares equal to the subway’s cheaper fares Patrick said the first DMUs would be deployed on the Fairmount Line  but acquiring the trains could also open up other opportunities  such as a link from Assembly Square in Somerville to a recently announced commuter rail station in Allston  near the Massachusetts Turnpike tolls “Basically anywhere there’s an existing rail line  to be able to run an efficient  lower density  more regular subway type service opens up all kinds of possibilities ” Patrick said Transportation Secretary Richard Davey said the state expects the new railcars to cost about $240 million  and that the state will seek bids for proposals before the end of the year The governor  the transportation secretary  and T general manager Beverly Scott were joined by local officials  most of whom deemed the 2017 opening of the Mattapan station a strong investment in an area that has long been neglected The Blue Hill Avenue station will cost about $25 2 million  funded by an intergovernmental service agreement related to the Central Artery Project  Construction on the station is expected in November 2015  with a projected opening date of December 2017 The station is the last currently scheduled for construction on the Fairmount Line  which is the only commuter rail line that runs entirely in the city of Boston  The station has had its share of opposition  Mattapan resident Barbara Fields has stood against the project for a number of reasons  including the damage that construction could do to the foundation of nearby homes such as hers  She also said the noise  traffic  and lighting accompanying the station will negatively affect the quality of life in the area  and argues that residents already have ample access to public transportation “We just don’t think it’s needed ” she said The crowd at Thursday’s session disagreed  State Representative Russell E  Holmes recounted how growing up in the neighborhood meant sometimes taking as long as 45 minutes to an hour to take public transportation downtown  With the new stop  officials say that trip could be cut to eighteen minutes State Representative Daniel R  Cullinane said the opening of the line and more frequent service means more economic development and access to opportunity for the neighborhood “Quality rapid public transit  like what is being announced today  is fundamental to the equality both in our neighborhoods and in every community of the city of Boston ” he said  The weekend service  scheduled to start Nov  29  will be the first time such a schedule has been offered on the Fairmount Line Coupled with the lower fares  it appears to be another way that T officials are attempting to make the line look as convenient as the subway

complaints prompted a federal investigation into troubling lapses in reporting campus crimes  while the state auditor’s office launched a review of financial mismanagement at the college s athletic center The financial aid program was in such disarray the US government refused to distribute funds directly  forcing the school to cover grants  then seek federal reimbursements  Under siege on multiple fronts  the college seemed to be coming apart at the seams  t nBut president Valerie Roberson  who arrived last summer  has led an aggressive turnaround plan  paring a budget that was millions in deficit  cutting administrative staff by about 20 percent  and taking a hard look at the entire academic operation Roberson has begun to reach out to area high schools in hopes of boosting enrollment  She is also seeking to strengthen relationships with area colleges  hospitals  and businesses to help students land internships and jobs  nRoberson said she took the job with the understanding that the school had plenty of problems  But over the past year  the full extent of its troubles became clear  she said “It was just the tip of the iceberg ” she said in an interview  “You find out the challenges are much more systemic  and we had to start at the foundation ”Gerald Chertavian  chairman of the college’s board of trustees who was appointed by Governor Deval Patrick last year  likened Roberson’s first year to a kind of triage  given the host of immediate problems the college faced Despite the sweeping overhaul  Chertavian and Roberson agree the college  long

services — making it simpler for students to find the right classes and receive financial aid — and reaching out to area high schools to rebuild a sense of trust “The college has to have a stronger relationship with college counselors and principals ” Roberson said The college has begun distributing an informational magazine called “Career Focus ” which highlights specific academic programs and their potential jobs  For example  a feature on the nursing program notes that licensed nurses earn more than $50 000 a year  while nursing assistants earn close to $30 000  nRichard Freeland  the state’s commissioner of higher education  said Roberson moved quickly to address the repeated shortcomings that had drawn state and federal scrutiny  and made sweeping changes to the staff  “She

reimbursements has accelerated  she said “We’re making significant progress ” she said  “They are gaining confidence ”The college was also facing a substantial deficit  with little money left in reserve  In the spring  the Legislature authorized $3 million to shore up the school’s finances Roberson said the college was not spending efficiently and she tried to cut costs without hurting academics The college’s administration is aggressively seeking more grants  and is working to bolster fund raising  she said  Chertavian said financial stability is crucial to the college’s success “This college both deserves and needs resources ” he said The newfound sense of progress stands in stark contrast to recent years  when the college faced a series of controversies that led to president Terrence Gomes stepping down in June 2012  nThe state auditor’s office found a range of financial lapses at the college’s Reggie Lewis Track and Athletic Center  and Roberson found the facility had been run with little oversight from the college  Under a new chief financial officer  the center has been brought into the fold  she said RCC had also come under investigation for failing to investigate and report sexual crimes on campus  including allegations against two employees In March 2013  the college released a report that found that senior administrators had not properly reported allegations of sexual assault and in one case had apparently paid a student to keep quiet  nNow  all mandatory reporters have received training on the proper procedures for handling allegations of sexual assaults and reporting them as required under federal law  n“We’re in full compliance ” she said  nIn its most recent information required under the Clery Act  RCC said it had received no reports of sexual offenses on campus in 2013  As a commuter school with a small campus  the college will typically have fewer reports of crimes than a residential campus  Roberson said  nStudents and recent graduates say they largely felt removed from the controversy swirling around the school  and that they didn’t believe it affected the quality of the classes  Kevin Small Jr   20  who graduated in the spring with a degree in business administration  said his overall experience at the school was extremely positive Small grew up in Dorchester and chose Roxbury Community College to help him adjust to college academics  He initially thought he would take just a few classes before transferring to a four year school  but wound up staying the full two years “I didn’t want to leave because the experience was so strong ” he said Now a student at Suffolk University  Small said his time at RCC prepared him well Roberson said that while handling immediate problems has consumed much of her time  it gave her greater insight into the college s inner workings “It’s been a tough year ” she said  “But in a strange way  it helped  It forced me to get into the weeds ”',

burial  which will be at Fairview Cemetery in Hyde Park  as well as attendees Vice President Joe Biden will be among them  He is planning to attend Menino’s funeral  his office announced Friday evening  but it’s unclear if other national political figures  including President Obama or former President Bill Clinton or Hillary Rodham Clinton may be there “This is the toughest ticket in town  The mayor would have loved it ” Menino’s longtime spokeswoman Dot Joyce said with a tiny melancholic chuckle Most Precious Blood Church  a Gothic style church with a graceful spire where Menino was baptized  can accommodate about 700 people in the main sanctuary and another 300 in the basement chapel Joyce said Menino was emphatic that family members be “front and center” at the service  and that Mayor Martin J  Walsh and Governor Deval Patrick be among the speakers “The mayor made his arrangements and we’re fulfilling his wishes ” Joyce said  “He’s just giving us another challenge ”“We have a crackerjack team  and we’ll make sure everyone we can fit into the church will be there ” she said Joyce declined to say who  specifically  is being invited to attend the funeral  but she said the former mayor made his wishes well known  and she and others are working to contact people  A website — TomMenino org — has been created with details about the funeral  The details of the service

mayor’s inquiring about attending the service He said the list of attendees is likely to include many of the same people who were invited to Menino’s annual State of the City address  That event at Faneuil Hall typically drew a crowd of 800 people  including the governor  members of Congress  and scores of elected officials  community leaders  and businesspeople Biden released a lengthy statement Friday praising his longtime friend “Tommy ” whom he characterized as “without a doubt one of the finest mayors this nation has ever seen ”As details for the official memorials began to fall

federal guidelines issued this week by the Environmental Protection Agency may force the state to update the standard it uses to measure water quality at beaches  potentially resulting in more red flags to alert swimmers to unsafe conditions  The warnings would be required when bacteria counts are as much as 40 percent lower than what the state considers safe today  t nThe state would be obliged to follow the new regulations  which would take effect in 2016  if it wants to continue receiving nearly $250 000 in federal aid for monitoring water quality at beaches  The state could also qualify for an exemption if it persuades federal officials it has a better way to monitor bacteria in water The rules are “intended to strengthen protection of the health of America’s beachgoers through safer water standards  improved beach monitoring  and better notification of advisories or closures ” said Emily Zimmerman  an EPA spokeswoman She said the rules would help improve identification of the sources of fecal pollution and encourage same day notification when the bacteria exceeds the new standards for safe swimming  The state now considers it unsafe to swim when a single sample is found to have 104 bacteria colony forming units per 100 milliliters of water  the new standard would lower that threshold to 60 or 70 units  depending on what the state chooses as its standard Officials from the state Department of Public Health declined to answer questions about the new federal standards In a statement  Suzanne Condon  the department’s associate commissioner  said  “We are in the process of reviewing these new guidelines to determine whether our current regulatory standards should be amended ” t nShe added that federal aid for the state’s beach program “is critical to our overall efforts on beach water quality monitoring ”Massachusetts has 571 public and semipublic beaches along 204 miles of Atlantic coast Last year  6 percent of samples collected from 497 Massachusetts beaches exceeded the state standard for safe swimming  according to a report of the nation’s beaches released this year by the Natural Resources Defense Council  an environmental advocacy group based in New York  If those beaches had used the new federal standard  10 percent of the samples would have triggered red flags  according to the report Fifty seven state beaches had samples that would have exceeded the new federal standard more than 20 percent of the time “New scientific evidence has shown that public health is at risk above the levels” when bacteria counts are higher than the new standards  said Steve Fleischli  the water program director of the Natural Resources Defense Council  “If states want to do right by the public and protect them from swimming with bacteria  they’ll use this” standard Swimming at beaches with higher levels of bacteria — often the result of sewage overflows or runoff from roads — could lead to stomach distress  ear infections  pink eye  fever  diarrhea  and neurological disorders In the Boston area  where state officials have spent years and some $5 billion cleaning the waters off local beaches  officials and advocates are sensitive to changes that might curb the number of days when it is considered safe to swim Just this year  state officials began using a new water monitoring policy in an effort to reduce the number of unnecessary beach closures  They estimated some 80 percent of beach closings over the past 13 years were unnecessary  mainly because the samples were taken the day before officials posted red flags At most of the state’s beaches  the new policy requires samples taken from two consecutive days to show elevated levels of bacteria before any action is taken  Those with a history of high bacteria counts can still be closed after one sample exceeds the current standard Bruce Berman  a spokesman for Save the Harbor Save the Bay in Boston  said few beaches along Boston Harbor would be significantly affected by any change in standards  But he said those beaches with a history of high bacteria counts  such as Wollaston in Quincy  King’s in Lynn and Tenean in Dorchester  would be closed more often under the federal standard He argued that state officials should focus more on the amount of rain than on collecting samples  n“The pollution is almost always associated with rain ” he said  “That would also allow us to not have to wait for a test  We could post the flags right away  based on how much rain we have ”He said the state should use years of data about how much rain causes elevated bacteria counts at specific beaches  rather than applying a blanket new standard  He said he expects the state to seek an exemption If the state chooses to apply the new standard  he said  that will mean more beach closures “I am definitely concerned more beaches will be flying red flags — and more wrong red flags — and that’s not a good thing ” he said  “It could be a dramatic and inappropriate increase  It would be based on yesterday’s test results ”', '2014_819')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no

busing When busing polarized Hyde Park High School  student Marsha Joan Galvin found herself in a lonely place  the middle  t nBy Scott Helman   Globe Staff nEach school morning  Marsha Joan Galvin followed the same routine  She met three neighborhood friends at 7 40 and they walked together to Hyde Park High School  First over the Neponset River  through the main square  and then up Central Avenue At the start of her senior year  in the fall of 1974  that final block on Central became a gantlet  School buses packed with black students arriving from Dorchester and Mattapan lined the street  a wall of yellow along the western edge of the building To the newcomers peering out of those bus windows  Galvin must have looked like any other neighborhood white girl — one more adversary in the us versus them climate that had set in at Hyde Park High and other newly integrated Boston schools  Walking the last block of sidewalk  jeers and insults flew “Honky ” “White trash ” “White bitch ”“It’s not a nice way to go to school every day ” said Galvin  whose maiden name was Aylward  The best response  she found  was to grit her teeth and keep walking  After all  this was her neighborhood  her school  She wasn’t about to change her route One morning  the heckling was worse than usual  Then she heard an unsettling noise  She felt something hit her back  She turned her head and confirmed it  A student had spit on her from an open bus window Galvin was incensed  Yes  lots of people had suffered worse  But  for her  this crossed a line “There’s no way you’re going to get away with that ” she thought  She marched toward the open bus door  Her friends tried to stop her “What are you doing ” they yelled  “Are you crazy ”The yelling from the bus grew louder as she approached  the black students no doubt amused by her moxie  What was she really going to do At the last moment  Galvin heeded her friends’ pleas  She halted at the steps  turned and stomped inside the school to clean herself off Had a photographer captured the scene  the image would have suited the era’s assumptions perfectly  race against race  violence a hair trigger away — a fitting snapshot of the fraught environment that was Hyde Park High in 1974 But here’s what that photograph wouldn’t say  While Galvin  17 years old and proud of her seven eighths Irish Catholic heritage  wasn’t one to shrink from provocation  she wanted no part of the hardening black and white divide  nhating someone for who they were and what they looked like appalled her  That wasn’t how she’d been raised  The black students on that bus knew nothing of that  “I was so the opposite of a ‘white bitch’ and ‘white trash’ and ‘get out of my neighborhood ’ u200a” she said She was equally bothered by the abuse some white neighbors and fellow students directed toward the buses  “They made such huge assumptions ” she said  “And it was so wrong ”Galvin’s rejection of both extremes left her feeling caught in the middle  seemingly without much company  Her sense of confusion and relative isolation  together with a horribly disrupted senior year of high school  would set her adrift  Just how much she wouldn’t know for a long time  nPrior to desegregation  she’d had some black friends  She was cool with different cultures  When busing hit  racial politics largely pushed people to opposing sides  Between them  a river of animosity flowed “I was on the bridge ” she said  “And that’s when it broke ” n“Welcome to the country club ”Those were the headmaster’s words to Ruth O’Day when she took a job teaching science at Hyde Park High School in 1966  Nestled between Dedham and Milton  Hyde Park — Boston’s southernmost neighborhood — felt almost suburban  with trees  space  and single family homes It was also  by Boston standards  relatively heterogeneous  Hyde Park had Italian and Irish families  as well as some black ones  Students from nearby Mattapan  a neighborhood in transition from heavily Jewish to largely African American  came to Hyde Park for high school  too By 1970  black teenagers composed around 7 5 percent of the student body  Thepercentage would more than double by the time of Garrity’s desegregation order   South Boston High School  by comparison  was nearly 100 percent white before the buses rolled  Black and white students did not always coexist peacefully at Hyde Park High  however  Racial violence closed the school early on one day in January 1970  for example  Unrest persisted into the next year Then busing began in September 1974  bringing in hundreds of new black students from Dorchester and Mattapan  Smoldering resentments flared  Things got ugly fast  even though Hyde Park would never become quite the tinderbox South Boston was “When it came  it came with such force ” said Adelaide Williams  a white physical education and health teacher at Hyde Park at the time   Williams would later suffer a career ending injury when struck by a black student in the locker room  On Sept  19  just a week into that historic school year  violence cut classes short  The city’s incident report from that day is a catalog of aggression  buses stoned all around the school  ambulances ferrying students to Carney Hospital  racial jibes  an arrest warrant for a black male accused of assaulting a white girl  and so on Less than a month later  on Oct  15  a 15 year old white student  Joseph Crowley  was stabbed in the abdomen during a melee in the school’s main corridor  At least six other students and one teacher went to the hospital  Students recall being locked in their classrooms  “I remember being scared to death ” said Stephanie Damata  a Hyde Park senior that fall Boston’s entire 125 member Tactical Police Force flooded the neighborhood  Governor Francis Sargent called up 450 National Guardsmen  over Mayor Kevin White’s objection  That night  some 1 500 people gathered at a Hyde Park municipal building to hear speakers demand an end to busing The Boston School Department soon installed a magnetometer  borrowed from United Airlines  to scan all students coming into school  An 18 year old black youth from Dorchester was ultimately arrested in Crowley’s stabbing Inside the classrooms  peace usually held  Trouble often started in the day’s seams — before and after school  at lunch  and between classes  You kept your coat with you  in case you had to flee  You wore sneakers for speed  You avoided the bathrooms  even if it meant limiting your liquids at breakfast  After school — often the day ended early — black and white students went their separate ways Several teachers said they don’t remember white Hyde Park parents being as openly hostile as those in South Boston  But there were protests  threats  and rocks thrown  including  on at least one occasion  by the parent of a white football player — a sight that left the biracial team badly shaken  “One of those things you’ll never forget ” said Anthony Lamar  a black senior on the squad There was also the nearby house where an effigy of a black ape hung from the front porch  said Lena Taylor  a youth worker for the city stationed at Hyde Park High  The black students got upset when they saw it  Taylor said  and so did she  “I just couldn’t show it ”Gail O’Reilly  who taught English  remembers going outside one day and being exasperated by a TV reporter’s question  Who had started that day’s fight — the white kids or the black kids  She found such accounting foolish  “There was plenty of blame to go around ”In this charged environment  relationships among white and black people — the sort that Marsha Joan Galvin and others had known before busing — became unsustainable Times had changed  Whose side were you on  nIt was their sweet evening ritual  a dad and his middle daughter stealing a few minutes together at the end of the workday Al Aylward  Marsha Joan’s father  would pull up to the house in his Pontiac Bonneville  She’d hop in and they would drive around the corner to Hy Way Spa  the local convenience store  She would eagerly run inside to fill dad’s order  one copy of the Boston Evening Globe  four packs of Camels  Then they’d drive back home for dinner Her father was a tool and die man  first for United Carr and then TRW when the companies merged  Working at factories in Cambridge and Newton  he retired as a plant manager  Earlier in his life  he had helped care for younger siblings after his own dad died young Now  as a father himself  he was loving but quiet  He read the newspaper cover to cover  and prized cars  Galvin held the flashlight while he tinkered in the carport  “He was a gear head ” she said  She learned to how change a car’s oil The second of four  Galvin had an older sister  a younger sister  and a younger brother  Their mother  Mary  enforced homework rules and kept the house  On frenetic nights  Mary Aylward established a dinner time rule she called 20 Minutes of Silence  She’d set the oven timer  and no one could talk until the bell For the first seven years of Galvin’s life  the family rented in Mattapan  where her mother had grown up   She and her siblings had attended Hyde Park High   The family bought a house up on Fairmount Hill in Hyde Park in the mid 1960s  where Mary Aylward still lives with Galvin’s younger sister  Michele As Galvin got older  her neighborhood crew included a black friend  David  and an Asian friend  Peter  David and Peter were at the birthday parties  too  David and Peter kissed whomever the bottle landed on during Spin the Bottle  Nobody’s parents seemed to have an issue  Galvin said But she started to become aware of prejudice and racism  White flight from Mattapan troubled her  “If everybody kept running ” she said  “it wasn’t going to cause people to understand each other better ”To Galvin  you could be both proud of your own heritage and accepting of others’  It wasn’t either or  Any racial epithet  in any direction  was contemptible  “We didn’t grow up like that ” said Michele Aylward  52  now a teacher in West Roxbury In high school  Galvin was studious and heavily involved in the Catholic Youth Organization  going to pie eating

began running with a faster crowd  They’d use their Boston Public Library cards to get into clubs  She told her mother they were bowling The summer of 1974 would be her last as a high schooler  She had just turned 17  A driver’s license had given her a taste of freedom  She wanted to enjoy her senior year  to soak up the final rays of youth  Real life would arrive soon enough Then real life showed up early  nThe yelling  the irate neighbors lining Metropolitan Avenue  the rancor — it shocked Galvin as she arrived at school as a senior  Busing was turning her world upside down  How had she failed to see it coming The busing plan wasn’t exactly a surprise  Parents had known its contours for months  Classmates had gone up to the State House with their families that spring to protest While other Hyde Park parents actively fought desegregation  though  Galvin’s did not  That may explain why she was caught off guard  “My parents didn’t prepare us for that  because they didn’t feel there was a reason to ” she said Indeed  Galvin remembers her mother promoting conciliation  She joined a biracial parents group  driving to Mattapan for meetings  She would later sign the Covenant for Justice  Equity  and Harmony  part of a controversial interfaith push in 1979 for peace and tolerance But Galvin was angry at Garrity  too  How could he order all of these high school students together without proper preparation  Why not start with younger grades and integrate gradually  Plus  busing had taken friends away from Hyde Park High “I remember thinking  like  ‘What the hell  How can you do this ’ u200a” Galvin said  If someone had asked her to sign a petition to stop busing  she said  she would have  That didn’t mean she was in league with the antibusing crowd  however  She didn’t blame or target black students  as some did  When white classmates shot racial epithets  Galvin said  she did not  When they started trouble  she steered clear  privately disgusted She wasn’t one to lecture others about injustice  It was more her way to walk away quietly On one occasion  however  she willed herself to act more forcefully  It was one of the bad days  School had let out early — again  Galvin was walking home with a friend on River Street when they saw a black woman  maybe in her 30s  driving alone in a sedan Galvin worried the woman would turn toward the high school — maybe she was picking someone up  Galvin feared what might happen to her   Galvin told herself So Galvin and her friend stepped off the curb  They walked toward the woman’s car  waving their arms “Stop ” they yelled  “Don’t go up there ”The woman looked over with alarm  She saw two white girls coming at her and misunderstood  She rolled up her window with urgency  hit the gas  and was gone  Their good intentions had backfired Galvin may have been sensitive and shy  but she was not meek  She had a stubborn pride  The day after she was spit on  she insisted on walking the very same route to school Her nerve nearly got her hurt on one tense day in the hallways  when she accidentally opened her locker door into the open locker of a black classmate  The other girl threw the door back and Galvin’s locker closed  The two slammed their doors back and forth  Their words grew heated Galvin thinks she probably called the girl a “stupid bitch ” But not “black bitch ” “If you hit me  I would hit you back ” Galvin said  “It wasn’t an issue of color ”The classmate had a soda bottle in her locker  She threatened to break it and cut Galvin with the glass  Galvin was steaming but scared  A senior boy whisked her away  The two girls avoided each other after that  nIn his year end letter to seniors  headmaster John Best wrote of the many kinds of people they would encounter in their lives  “You will work with them  live near them  belong to the same groups or clubs or churches ” he wrote  “Your children will play with their children and go to school with them ”If there were any silver lining to busing  Best suggested  it was that Hyde Park had prepared the class of 1975 to function in diversity That was true  to a degree  Galvin enjoyed a class trip to Bermuda that some black students went on too  They had their prom  she wore a green halter dress  Anthony Lamar found ways to bring black and white students together through football and the yearbook Still  the 1974 75 school year left lasting damage  Dom DiMare  a senior that year  said the busing strife derailed his college plans  costing him earning potential later in life  “My study habits were shot ” he said A guidance counselor had suggested to Galvin that she pursue forestry at University of Massachusetts Amherst  The idea held some appeal  She liked the outdoors  She decided to do it What no one told her was that forestry required a heavy load of science classes  such as botany and chemistry  At Hyde Park  she’d been forced to drop chemistry to take typing  because administrators needed racial balance in the classes Once at UMass  she discovered how unprepared she was  She’d always considered herself a good student  She began questioning her high school education  even though she remained proud to be from Hyde Park  stigma and all  For the first time in her life  she was getting D’s and F’s Busing had broken her arc  Lost on the massive campus  she felt a world apart from other students  who couldn’t understand what she’d been through  Any sense of direction or momentum she’d once had — that was gone now  She hated the idea of being labeled stupid  “That was a bad hit for me ” she said Galvin largely kept her struggles quiet  She was paying for her education anyway  so it wasn’t exactly her parents’ business  She lasted two semesters before UMass put her on academic suspension  In a letter appealing the decision  she argued that the violence and tension at Hyde Park had robbed her of so much  UMass denied the appeal She moved home for the summer and fall of 1976  She told people she was taking time off to make money to pay for college  She went backto UMass in January 1977  After one more semester  the university kicked her out for good Galvin felt humiliated  She was reeling  her self confidence gone  She couldn’t blame her poor grades entirely on busing  She had partied  too  Plus she was working a lot  But the shock waves of desegregation had buckled the ground beneath her feet  nWhen busing began  Galvin quickly understood its significance in the history of her city  She started cutting out newspaper articles  just like she’d done five years earlier when Neil Armstrong walked on the moon What she hadn’t anticipated was how deeply busing would affect her  and how long it would take to recover  That confusion she’d felt at 17 still hovered  a few years later  like a dark cloud  nAfter leaving UMass Amherst  she got a job cooking for a sorority  her first taste of working in food service  She took a few months to travel and then returned to the kitchen  finding work at a Brookline hospital  She discovered that not only was she passionate about food  she was good at it The smart  hard working kid began to reemerge  “All the sudden  there was this awakening ” she said  “Like  ‘I’m not an idiot ’ u200a”She soon felt limited by not having a college degree  “I got frustrated that I only had hands ” she said  In her 20s  she enrolled in a chef training program at Bunker Hill Community College  also earning an associate’s degree in hospitality  At graduation  she learned she had the highest grade point average in the program  She was back on track Galvin grew hungry for bigger  supervisory roles  While working at Milton Hospital  she started taking classes at Northeastern University  When she made the dean’s list  she would frame the certificates and hang them in her living room At age 37  that elusive bachelor’s degree — now in business administration — was finally hers  “I didn’t need to prove it to anyone else  because nobody else knew I flunked out of college ” she said  “I needed to prove it to myself ”She would go on to beat cancer at age 40  leave Milton Hospital  and eventually find the job she has today  as food service manager at a residential school for children with special needs  It’s her way of giving back These days  Galvin  now 57 and living with her husband  Dan  in Needham  still thinks about the busing years sometimes  especially when she’s back in Hyde Park  The fear  the strain  the flaws in Garrity’s plan — it’s all fresh in her memory  She  like many others who suffered quietly  paid a price that’s never been fully tallied When Galvin looks back on it  she sometimes regrets not being more outspoken about what was right  and what was wrong  “I felt that I observed for too long ” she said In the 40 years since  she’s grown more comfortable speaking her mind  Not always about racial equality  About anything that demands more than quiet protest  She found her voice  n n',

 At Roxbury’s Twelfth Baptist Church  the Rev  Jeffrey L  Brown prayed that God would “stay the hand of violence” in all the city’s neighborhoods   n“I pray          that you talk to these young people who are at risk of violence  who are ensconced in the violence  Lord ” Brown said from the pulpit  “And Lord  speak to us today  help us to stand          in our neighborhoods  in our community ” Brown  a cofounder of the anticrime Boston TenPoint Coalition  was among a group of clergy who met Wednesday with Boston Police Commissioner William Evans and Superintendent in Chief William Gross to discuss ways to end the killings   nA spate of shootings during the previous weekend brought Boston’s homicide total for January to nine  the highest number for that month in years  Statistics provided by Boston police show that the January death toll has not been comparably high since 2008  when it reached eight  Police have said the killings and other  nonfatal  shootings appear to be gang related  Parishioners leaving Twelfth Baptist said police and community members need to step up to end the violence  Dorchester resident Charlotte Burton  53  called on police to send a message to young people  “The police should meet with the gang leaders and express the need to stop the violence for our future youth  because the children are seeing that  and feeling that  and thinking that’s the way things ought to be ” Burton said Eva Grant said she is sometimes afraid to leave her Roxbury home after dark to come to the church’s Friday evening prayer service  She said she would like to see more police walking beats and speaking directly to residents in the troubled sections of the city  “Introduce the kids to them  because the kids are very important  they’re the key to the violence that is going on ” said Grant  48  nEvans said shortly after being sworn in as commissioner that assigning more officers to walk beats is one of his top priorities Police said Sunday that increased patrols and a greater focus on suspected drug and gang activity had led to the seizure of six illegal guns on Friday and Saturday  “This should send a strong message to those who possess illegal firearms that when it comes to combating gun violence  our officers are out there and fully committed to making our city the safest city it can be ” Evans said in a statement And  despite the rise in homicides  statistics provided by police show that serious crimes  including robberies  assaults  and rapes  were down 9 percent overall through Jan  26  compared with the same period last year  In interviews Sunday  faith leaders from three Dorchester churches offered suggestions for ways to stop the slayings The Rev  Bruce Wall  of Global Ministries Christian Church  said he would like to see a sociological study  “We’ve been missing the fact that there are clergy who are actually chaplains in the jails ” he said  and those clergy could contribute to leaders’ understanding of urban violence  Wall said he wanted to see a long term plan developed that would not only reduce homicides in the near term  but maintain peace  He said Wednesday’s meeting with Gross was “inspirational ” and he appreciated “having a chief of color who knew us and knew us by name  who understood us  who could crack jokes with us “But if all of this is a press conference  if this is just for the media to show the police and clergy together  I don’t want to be a part of it ” he said  Mark V  Scott  associate pastor of the Azusa Christian Community  said in a phone interview that he spoke to his congregation Sunday about the need to work with the judicial system to ensure that people with criminal records are kept in check  Scott said he emphasized “concrete  specific” action  Police “shared the list of the groups  these gangs  that are involved with this  It’s not a long list  There are maybe a half dozen groups that are involved ” he said  “We can go talk with them ”At Greater Love Tabernacle Church  the Rev  William E  Dickerson II  who also attended the meeting with police  told a reporter that he is pleased to see officers interacting with community members “They’re out of their cars  they’re in the gyms  they’re engaging  It means a lot ” he said  He said he would like to see more job training programs  or an expansion of existing programs  People need to care for their families financially  he said  and can turn to gangs when there are no other options  Pointing to the so called Boston Miracle  when antiviolence efforts led by a coalition of police and clergy reduced homicides in the city from 152 in 1990 to 31 in 1999  Dickerson said effective techniques already exist  “It’s not rocket science ” Dickerson said  “Some of the stuff that worked for us years ago can work now  And whatever needs to be modified  we can modify ”', '2014_441')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article',

morning while sky diving in Pepperell had recently gotten engaged  was dedicated to the sport  and had made hundreds of jumps over the years  friends and authorities said Daniel Pelrine died of blunt trauma from the accident  which occurred just after 11 a m  Sunday  said John Guilfoil  a spokesman for the Pepperell Police Department  It is unclear whether an equipment malfunction led to his death  he said   t nA woman who answered the phone early Sunday afternoon at   the business that operated the sky diving trip  said the company was not commenting at that time  No one answered when a reporter called again last night A small plane was parked on the narrow runway at Skydive Pepperell on Sunday evening  about a half mile down a dusty path off Nashua Road  An open field surrounded by woods lies in front of tents and what appears to be a small hangar Police and employees at the scene were tight lipped about the death  saying that family members and the company would not be giving statements Sunday  Reporters and onlookers who tried to drive up to the airport were turned back MaryBeth Long  a spokeswoman for the Middlesex district attorney  said her office is investigating Pelrine’s death but did not disclose any additional details Sunday night  State Police  the Federal Aviation Administration  and the state medical examiner’s office are also investigating  Pelrine proposed to his girlfriend about six months ago  said Kris MacDonald  Pelrine’s friend of 14 years  The couple had been dating for at least five years  he said MacDonald  a realtor  said Pelrine bought his first real estate listing and described him as a “loyal  genuine  stand up guy” whom people admired “Everyone thought highly of him ” MacDonald said Pelrine’s girlfriend had said she would move in with him only after they were engaged  according to MacDonald  so his proposal coincided with the purchase of an old  two story schoolhouse on Hillsboro Road in Mattapan that had been converted into a family home  There  the two lived with her 9 year old son from a previous marriage  The plan was to renovate the home so that the boy could take piano lessons in one of its rooms  MacDonald said  Pelrine recently bought a piano  said Terry Webster  an ironworker and colleague who helped him move it inside Pelrine also wanted to put in a garage and possibly add more rooms In a recent conversation  Pelrine told MacDonald that he was budgeting money for the renovation and the wedding  There was “excitement in his voice ” MacDonald said  Despite their long friendship  MacDonald always refused Pelrine’s invitations to sky dive  “We joked about my fear of heights  versus his no fear of heights ” MacDonald said MacDonald said Pelrine told him he had made more than 450 jumps  and shared videos he shot during jumps  Webster recalled Pelrine’s love of sky diving in a phone interview Sunday  He said his friend told him he had jumped as many as 10 times in a day “He was always trying to get me to go with him ” said Webster  He said he was shocked and emotional after learning of his friend’s death  Pelrine’s new home was a few doors down from where Webster’s mother  Julie Gonzales  lives After Pelrine moved in earlier this year  he was often in the yard chopping firewood  Gonzales and Webster said Pelrine was a kind man — and a very good ironworker “He was very nice ” Gonzales said  “He showed us all around the house and said we could come back anytime ”Neighbors recalled seeing him play soccer with neighborhood youths at a park nearby In Pepperell on Sunday afternoon  Brian Beek  47  said he often sees sky divers launch off planes above his house  about a half mile from the airport  About two years ago  a man landed  with no injuries  in the woods behind his house on Nissitissit Lane  walked up to the porch  and asked to use a phone  Beek said Sometimes  he said  he can hear the wind filling up the parachutes as the sky divers glide down He went sky diving with Skydive Pepperell a few year ago and said they “run a good operation ”“It’s times like this one you get bad press ” he said  “Accidents happen ”The company has been in operation since 1991

scoured Copley Square on Saturday afternoon  some 1 300 mourners gathered at Trinity Church to say a final farewell to the Rt  Rev  M  Thomas Shaw  who served as bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Massachusetts for two decades He died last month after a 17 month battle with brain cancer  He was 69  and his diagnosis came shortly after he announced plans to retire  t nShaw was a professed monk of the Society of St  John the Evangelist  a religous community based in Cambridge  His funeral reflected both his vaunted office and his preference for simplicity  In an unforgettable moment near the end of the service  Trinity’s rumbling organ and enormous choir were quiet  As incense wafted around them  Shaw’s religious brothers  clad in their black robes  surrounded his wooden casket and chanted the dismissal sung at the monastery each night in the last service before sleep   n nA number of mourners who attended the service spoke afterward about Shaw’s profound spirituality “You felt like you were talking to heaven when you talked to him ” said Frankie Brescia of Dorchester  a member of the Cathedral Church of St  Paul downtown  cracking a rueful smile  “He had a pretty direct line up there ”But they also recalled his sense of humor  “He got what mattered ” said the Rev  Jep Streit  dean of the cathedral  “And he also got when to hold lightly to things           I’ve never met anyone who was more holy or more unpretentious ” Brother Geoffrey Tristram  the superior of Shaw’s order  who presided over the service  recalled in his homily how Shaw used to remove his bishop’s pectoral cross upon returning home to the monastery in the evenings  One night  he forgot  and a woman who had come for the evening service asked why he was the only brother wearing a cross  “And he said straightaway ” Tristram recalled  “ u2002‘Oh  I’m the monk of the month ’ u2002” Tristram remembered Shaw as a visionary  a bishop who was especially good at seeing potential in people  and the possibility of making a difference  of transformation  He found perspective on the world through early morning prayer in his monastic cell  His daily attention to prayer was “not out of virtue  but out of need ” Tristram said Shaw’s passion for social justice and love for young people led him to find ways to end street violence  Tristram said  He redoubled his efforts after young Jorge Fuentes  a 19 year old star graduate of a diocesan youth program  was gunned down outside his home in September 2012  Tristram said he had never seen Shaw so utterly devastated as he had been after Fuentes’s death “He saw that every single individual had been wonderfully created in the image of God  and anything which stopped them          reaching their full glory was not just unjust  but sinful ” he said  Shaw spoke out in the public square  Tristram said  testifying at the State House  protesting outside the Israeli embassy about the plight of Palestinians  and traveling to Zimbabwe   The presiding bishop of the Episcopal Church of the United States  Kathleen Jefferts Schori  attended the funeral  as did a half dozen other bishops from around the country  But there was a distinctly familial sensibility to the gathering  Virtually all the Episcopal clergy in the diocese came — not processing  but sitting among the people in the pews  Shaw’s religious brothers served as pallbearers alongside his two biological brothers  Sam and Stephen Jackie Drapeau  Shaw’s assistant for 11 years  carried Shaw’s crozier  or bishop’s staff  into the service  where it was placed atop his casket “I’ll miss his companionship  his deep spiritual intellect  his love  his sense of humor ” she said in a brief interview earlier Linda Davidson  a member of Trinity Church who lives in Newton  said she would recall Shaw’s “gentle spirit and his concern for all humanity ”Shaw was present when Bishop Alan M  Gates was consecrated as bishop in early September  one of his final public appearances as bishop “There is deep grief across the diocese ” Gates said in an interview before the service  “But I think also people are grateful for the time that they have had to make goodbyes  and say thank you ”Gates said he thought Shaw would have wanted those who attended the funeral to “take away         what he wanted people always to take away from his life  which is the sure and certain conviction that God is with us in all times and places ”  The Rev  Kelly O’Connell  who served as an aide to Shaw from 1998 to 2000  traveled from Los Angeles to be at Trinity to say goodbye  “It was beautiful ” she said  “It was perfect ”', '2014_286')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no

Like nine million other Americans  Moffett got support during the lean years of the Great Depression from the government’s Works Progress Administration  which commissioned him to produce patriotic artwork for the WPA’s new federal buildings  His 1937 mural  “A Skirmish Between British and Colonists Near Somerville in Revolutionary Times ” depicting a clash that helped ignite the Revolutionary War  still graces the wall of the post office in Somerville’s Union Square  Moffett’s mural  and the building that houses it  are a tiny part of our national patrimony — proceeds of the country’s last major investment in the public realm  In the decade between 1933 and 1943  the WPA and other New Deal programs supported tens of thousands of artists  funding 2 566 murals and 17 744 pieces of sculpture  That’s in addition to constructing 65 000 buildings  46 000 bridges  and countless parks  train stations  dams  housing developments  and roadways  Historic structures range from Johnny Cash’s boyhood home in Arkansas to  irony alert   the Ronald Reagan National airport near Washington   t nNow a California based group called— including 219 in Massachusetts alone — in an effort to preserve both the physical structures and the civic impulse undergirding the program  Just within Route 128  a quick scroll locates the metal truss bridge at Farwell Street in Waltham  the George Wright Golf Course in Hyde Park  the Great Blue Hill observation tower in Milton  the Mary Ellen McCormack housing project in South Boston  and US post offices in Everett  Arlington  Brookline  Dedham  Milton  and more  All of these projects put idle Americans to work and modernized the nation’s infrastructure so it would be ready when the recovery came Sturdily made  architecturally significant  the New Deal’s public buildings project a sense of authority and even grandeur  but with the clean  stripped down lines of the Art Deco style  Even simple cabins in state parks creatively used natural materials to blend in with their settings  They are artifacts of a time when government institutions — schools  courthouses  even waterworks — commanded a certain respect  and the quality of design and craftsmanship reflected that  Many WPA era buildings are still in use  but others are in jeopardy  We can’t seem to find the money to repair our crumbling public works  so several are on a demolition list  The facades of those on the National Register of Historic Places can’t be altered without official approval  but the interiors are fair game  One historic WPA post office in Greenwich  Conn   was sold in 2011 to a private developer who turned it into a Restoration Hardware store  We have traveled a long way from a time when public buildings were revered precisely because they belonged to everyone  Now public facilities from schools to swimming pools are being privatized  Corporations “adopt” highways that the taxpayers won’t pay to maintain  We rely on private developers to pay for roads and streetlights  The disdain for government intervention in the economy was evident in the reception President Obama’s rather tentative stimulus program received in 2009  The idea that government might be “here to help” is a lame punchline Today  the Union Square post office and Moffett’s patriotic mural have been sold  as the US Postal Service embarks on a liquidation program to reduce its $20 billion deficit  The building was purchased for $2 75 million by the music impresario Don Law  who is expected to develop it into an arts or entertainment venue  and who promises to preserve the painting  Still  it’s unclear what kind of access the public will have to the property Robert Reich  the former US labor secretary who sits on the board of The Living New Deal  has written that “we need a new WPA to rebuild the nation’s crumbling infrastructure and put jobless Americans back to work ” True enough  But we also need it to restore a sense of shared pride in a

Megan Costello  who headed Walsh’s mayoral campaign  is leading a “woman to woman persuasion training” session  Around her  dozens of volunteers are making calls  Their targets are independent  or so called unenrolled  Boston voters  t nCostello  on leave from her Walsh administration job  rattles off numbers  Since Sept  29  some 150 Boston volunteers have made 100 000 telephone calls and knocked on nearly 25 000 doors  But Costello knows the numbers mean nothing unless they add up to a Coakley victory  “We know where every single vote is  We just have to chase it ” said Costello What’s happening in one union hall on one night is a small piece of the vaunted statewide get out the vote operation that Democrat John Walsh put together for Deval Patrick in 2006  It has been working smoothly ever since for Democrats from Barack Obama to Elizabeth Warren  Now the test is whether it will also work for Coakley Walsh  no relation to the mayor  insists he’s not worried about the get out the vote machine Republicans claim to be building for Charlie Baker  Republicans  said Walsh  identify “data ” Democrats identify people who vote for Democrats However  Baker is trying to tweak the usual Republican election formula by  like Lowell  Lawrence  Springfield  and Boston  He last week went to Blue Hill Avenue to announce an urban agenda  “It doesn’t cause me to worry so much ” said Walsh  “What it does for us is make people step up their game ”Coakley needs a stepped up machine  Some Democrats  like Quincy Mayor Thomas Koch  are   and there are troubling signs of waffling by others  Former attorney general Tom Reilly is supposedly supporting Coakley — yet he still  for an ad that claims Baker outsourced jobs as chief executive of insurer Harvard Pilgrim Health Care The downtown business crowd    the ex chairman of Partners HealthCare  is firmly with Baker  Democrats say that’s good for fund raising and headlines  but it’s no substitute for hard core  grass roots organizing  “The part that is underappreciated ” said Walsh  “is the mechanical piece of collecting all the elements of our coalition that make it work on election day ”That is  put together campaign organizations for all the Democratic candidates on the statewide ticket  Add in congressional and state legislative candidates  Throw in popular  high profile Democratic officeholders — from Patrick to Walsh — and turn out voters for Coakley on election day Or so the Democratic election equation usually goes Since primary day  Patrick has been  of the Coakley campaign effort    At first  Mayor Walsh played coy  saying he thought Baker would be a good governor  But  in the end  the mayor   and his supporters say they are now working hard for Coakley “When the mayor endorsed Martha Coakley  that told me that was his focus ” said Dan Manning  another Marty Walsh loyalist who showed up last week at the IBEW hall  Baker signs in Boston don’t scare Manning  “They look great in windows  They don’t vote ” he said Still  political machines can deliver only so much  Warren Tolman  Walsh’s pick for attorney general  lost Boston to rival Maura Healey  Maybe that’s not so bad  given that Tolman lost the overall primary by a huge 62 to 38 percent margin Labor is a key part of Mayor Walsh’s coalition  But union leaders can’t guarantee rank and file votes  Unions backed Coakley in her 2010 loss to Republican Scott Brown  but  taken after the election showed that members voted for Brown over Coakley Ultimately  however  what fires up voters is not a machine  It’s an inspirational candidate  Coakley is no Patrick  neither is Baker  That reality is probably harder on Coakley  though  since Democrats expect more poetry from their candidates “Is Martha Coakley or the Democratic Party perfect  No ” said Costello  “But in my heart of hearts  I believe government is good and does good things for people  That’s who Marty is  and that’s why he’s with Martha ”Now she and the Walsh machine must get a large number of Boston voters to reach the same conclusion — and turn out for Coakley on election day', '2014_696')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article',

might cry  His first stop was the Mattapan Square Mobil  where owner Stacey Thomas blinked in the gray light of morning  unaccustomed to seeing Moore at that hour or dressed like this  crisp white

picking up more Jamaican beef patties for the warming case by the register or taking her deposits to the bank  dressed in sneakers and jeans  “Where you going  Funeral today ” Yes  he told her  for the mayor  He took one of the “Thank You Mayor Menino” signs she had at the counter  put it on his back dash between two American flags  and drove up Blue Hill Avenue toward the Mattapan library  He had seen on the news that the branch libraries had condolence books  and he wanted to sign one  His heart had plunged when he heard Menino was stopping cancer treatments  and he had cried off and on since Thursday  when the mayor died  thinking of Mrs  Menino and the mayor’s too short retirement and his own father  20 years gone  He thought of the six funerals he had been to this year  mostly because of cancer  He loved that Menino had been true to his word about urban neighborhoods  the way he had invested in Mattapan Square  Grove Hall  and Dudley and built buildings like this  a gleaming new library of glass and stone  “One of the best there ever was ” he thought  “A heart for everyone ” He had seen Menino at events but never approached him  not wanting to bother him  In his own way  though  Monty Moore considered himself like Menino  able to connect with all kinds  At Charlestown High during school busing  he had gotten along with everyone  a polite kid from the Cathedral projects with an easy charm  Maybe he could have been class president  if he had not been so busy selling papers  serving ice cream from a Mr  Frosty truck  and working at Mike’s Meat Market  on Washington Street  The customers there adored him  telling him with his smooth manner and close cropped beard that he reminded them of R B singer songwriter Teddy Pendergrass  He had a smile and kind words for all of them  and when Mike gave him a chance to buy the shop at just 21  some 2 000 neighbors signed a petition to help him get a loan  He got it  and for three years he was in heaven

knee and his neck — a bulging disc and mix of numbness and pain  despite fusion surgery — throbbing in the November cold  forcing him to abandon plans to see Menino lying in state on Sunday  But he would not miss this  the procession He had time still  and he steered his Mazda to Fairview Cemetery in Hyde Park  The woman there told him it was good he came early  with the mayor getting buried that afternoon  He found his father’s marker  Robert Wayne Moore  1920 1994  and his heart swelled  wearing his dad’s rosary beads  he told him that Menino would be buried somewhere nearby  a mayor

saluted  holding it steady as the motorcycles  the flower car  the hearse  and all the limos passed  His knee throbbing  his neck aching  his fingers numb  still he saluted  The last car rolled by  he

Henriquez did at his Dorchester home was to watch a historic video clip  the one of his fellow legislators expelling him from the chamber earlier this year The experience  Henriquez said in his first interview since he was released on parole Wednesday  was “a little surreal ” nSo is much of life for the former lawmaker as he makes the transition from a jail cell back to the community he represented on Beacon Hill for more than three years  He was convicted of two misdemeanor assault charges in January and expelled by his colleagues in February  Speaking by telephone from his home Thursday  he maintained his innocence and said he was considering another run for public office  He explained that the experience of being incarcerated had reaffirmed  in the most profound way  his belief that the state is not doing enough to reduce the number of people who end up in jail and to rehabilitate those who do “It’s only been a glimpse — and I don’t want a longer glimpse — of what incarcerated” people experience  he said “You realize that the correctional system is not correcting ” he said The Democrat insisted he harbored no animus toward the elected officials  including Governor Deval Patrick and Mayor Martin J  Walsh of Boston  who called on him to resign after he was convicted  nHe did not heed those calls and became the first Massachusetts state representative in almost 100 years  Henriquez  37  said he had “entertained the idea of running” for his old seat  which includes parts of Dorchester and Roxbury  but “as of  Thursday   I am not ”To begin the process of qualifying for this year’s ballot  he would have had to submit 150 signatures from registered voters to the Boston Election Department by 5 p m  Tuesday  He was not released from the Middlesex jail in Billerica  where he served his time  until the next day But Henriquez did not rule out a write in campaign this year  or another bid in the future “Being home less than 24 hours  I have to at least be open” to running  he said  adding he had received encouragement from friends and neighbors to try to return to the State House  But  he said  he still considers himself a young man and believes he has time to consider his next step “Public office is not the only way to serve your community ” he said Evandro Carvalho  32 and a Democrat  will succeed Henriquez in the seat representing parts of Dorchester and Roxbury  Carvalho won an uncontested special election Tuesday  after coming out on top in a competitive Democratic primary contest earlier in April  Henriquez said he had not spoken to Carvalho since getting out of jail Henriquez was convicted Jan  15 of holding down a female acquaintance and punching her in the chest when she refused to have sex with him  A jury found him guilty of two misdemeanor counts of assault and battery  while acquitting him of other charges  A Cambridge District Court judge sentenced him to 2½ years in the House of Correction and ordered him to serve six months of the sentence The jury  Henriquez said  got it wrong in convicting him “The thing about the truth is  It doesn’t change ” he said  Henriquez added he was working “toward an appeal” of his conviction  now that he has access to more resources than he did in jail  including being able to use a telephone for extended periods of time In the half hour interview  Henriquez repeatedly returned to how the experience of being in jail — living with another man in “a 7 foot by 13 foot cell that includes your toilet and your sink and a desk” — had deepened his sense that the state needs to focus more on better rehabilitating those who are incarcerated and making sure fewer people are Jail  he said  is at odds with the idea of rehabilitation “If you think about spending 20 hours a day in a room maybe a little bigger than your bathroom  with little sunlight         it kind of runs contrary to everything a professional would tell you is needed to have a healthy mind and body ” he said Henriquez added he was struck by how much the state spends on keeping people behind bars  but how little it spends on working to make sure people do not end up incarcerated “We keep treating the symptoms  but we’re not really treating the root causes ” he said  citing poverty and schools that do not prepare students for careers that can allow them to support themselves and avoid poverty',

projects to fruition Plans for the $70 7 million Dearborn STEM Academy  which will replace its existing building in Roxbury and serve grades 6 to 12  have stalled so frequently during the past seven years that many supporters began to question whether it would ever be built  t nBut Wednesday  after the Massachusetts School Building Authority approved the project  one supporter wept at the meeting  The vote marked the first time the agency approved funding for a new school in Boston since a moratorium on reimbursements ended in 2007 “It brought tears to my eyes ” said Sheila Gunn  a trustee at the Roxbury Presbyterian Church  which pushed for the project  “This will just add to the revitalization of Roxbury and the Dudley Street area  Good things come to those who wait ”The school’s focus on science  technology  engineering  and math is expected to be a boon in a neighborhood with high unemployment  equipping students with the skills to succeed in a more technologically advanced economy  It will replace a more than century old building  designed as an all girls’ high school and plagued recently by aging electrical systems and other problems Construction is expected to begin next year  school officials said “This will change the lives of generations of students ” said Jose Duarte  the Dearborn’s principal  calling the vote historic  “Imagine a STEM school in the heart of Roxbury ”In a city where some school buildings date to the late 1800s  the lack of new construction has long frustrated students  parents  and teachers  They wonder why new schools have been going up in places like Newton  Norwood  and Wellesley  but not in Boston Boston opened its last new schools in 2003  the Orchard Gardens K 8 in Roxbury  the Frederick Middle School in Dorchester  and the Mildred Avenue K 8 in Mattapan Earlier this year  Mayor Martin J  Walsh vowed in his inaugural address to ensure Boston receives its fair share of state construction money “as part of a plan to rebuild its long neglected and antiquated school buildings ”Many factors have contributed to  nthe School Department’s failure to advance projects Vacant land is scarce  making it difficult to find locations for new schools  a problem that has stalled efforts to give Boston Arts Academy and the Quincy Upper School new buildings  The most recent proposal calls for a $261 million facility that would house both schools on Kneeland Street  which would break a state record for the most expensive school Some observers say overlapping oversight between the School Department  City Hall  the specific schools involved  and the state building authority has led to differences in ideas and execution  causing projects to languish Walsh  as a mayoral candidate  picked up on this issue  calling for  a school building oversight council to “break the silos that stand in the way of planning and realizing school construction projects ”State Treasurer Steve Grossman  who oversees the school building authority  said Friday he was delighted that a new school is on its way  The state will cover $36 6 million of the construction costs “This one took a good deal of time to bake  but the recipe is a sound one ” Grossman said  “This is the first project that will be built from the ground up exclusively as a STEM early college school ”It took an incredible amount of tenacity for the Dearborn and its supporters  including the Greater Boston Interfaith Organization and the Trinity Episcopal Church in Copley Square  to make their dream a reality  The project has evolved from a renovation to an entirely new building and is credited for helping save a school on the brink of closure Enrollment had been sliding for years  In 2010  the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education designated the Dearborn  which educates many Cape Verdean immigrants still learning English  as “underperforming” because of low MCAS scores Although test results and enrollment have been rising  organizers believe a new school could cement its turnaround  Through the years  they have canvassed the neighborhood drumming up support At one monumental meeting in April 2010 that drew hundreds  organizers called in the mayor  superintendent  head of the school building authority  and the state treasurer to make commitments to the new school  Two years later  when the project was waning once again  organizers pressed the officials to promise a groundbreaking by spring 2014 School officials  however  do not expect to meet that deadline  Razing the current building will be a big job  involving the removal of asbestos and the challenges of demolition on a narrow  dense Greenville Street  Supporters understand “This is very exciting and concrete and people understand we are moving along ” said the Rev  Liz Walker  pastor of the Roxbury Presbyterian Church  “People who have not known how to trust are learning now to trust promises and their own potential ”Bruce Thatcher  whose son is a Dearborn eighth grader  said he cannot wait for the new school and plans to send his daughter there  as well  The family lives seven blocks away “Science  technology  engineering  and math — that’s where the new jobs are going to be ” Thatcher said  “Both of my children are very excited to be able to partake in this kind of education ”The project still faces one more hurdle  In the coming weeks  the City Council will decide on a loan order for the project  Support is already emerging “It is absolutely critical that we support this project and the opportunity it will provide for young people in Roxbury as well as the city of Boston to get the best education possible in the latest and greatest facility ” said City Councilor Tito Jackson  who represents Roxbury and chairs the

Center for minor injuries  another MBTA employee heard a cellphone ringing in her purse  police wrote Police said surveillance video that captured eight angles inside the bus showed that Shaw had an object in her left hand as the bus turned  The camera also showed the object  which appeared to be a cellphone  falling to the floor during the crash  then getting kicked by an exiting passenger  “Shaw is observed  on surveillance video  checking her pockets and her bag as though she is looking for something ” the report said  She later boarded the bus to retrieve it  police said After reviewing the video  investigators interviewed Shaw again  She acknowledged having a cellphone at the time of the crash  but said she had innocently left it in the pocket of a jacket stashed inside the driver’s compartment  Later  she told police that while the bus was in motion  she put it in her pants pocket  She later acknowledged the phone was in her hand  police wrote in the report  Shaw offered her cellphone to investigators  The phone had no record of calls or text messages made or received from 5 to 9 30 a m  that Sunday  according to court documents After the crash  Higgins told police he did not hear the driver sneeze  and did not notice her using a cellphone  He said Tuesday that he did not see Shaw board the bus after the crash As they waited for paramedics to arrive  Shaw  with glass in her hair  whimpered in pain  Higgins recalled  Another passenger tried to comfort her  Higgins encouraged her to sit down  but she said her leg hurt too much At one point  he looked over the guard rail and saw pieces of metal strewn about on a lane of the Turnpike “It was lucky that it happened at 7 30 on a Sunday morning ” Higgins said  “Otherwise  she could have hurt somebody

the promotion is an important step “I’m grateful to stand on the shoulders of those who came before me ’’ Stallworth said in a phone interview after the ceremony  “I know a lot of people made it possible for me to be here  who paved the way for me ”Acting Fire Commissioner John Hasson hailed the promotion as a great day for the department  Hasson praised Stallworth for his hard work  dedication  and years of study “It shows that the department offers an opportunity for everybody ’’ Hasson said  “It shows that with hard work and dedication you can get to any grade you want ”In his new role  Stallworth will serve as fire marshal and head the department’s fire prevention division  Based at 1010 Massachusetts Ave   he will oversee code enforcement  permitting  education  and inspection  n“It’s tremendous ’’ said Lieutenant Rayshawn Johnson  president of the Boston Society of Vulcans  which advocates for the recruitment  retention  and promotion of black firefighters  “This lets some of these younger firefighters know that they can aspire to be a deputy on the job ”Stallworth  a 23 year veteran of the force  grew up in Roxbury and went to the James P  Timilty Middle School  which has a storied reputation of honing young black boys  He was raised in Roxbury near Columbus Avenue  “You learned to keep your head down and your nose to the grind ’’ he said He knew early that he wanted a way up to something better  he said  After graduating from high school in Charlestown  he joined the Army Reserve and then the Fire Department in 1991  getting his start in firefighting at Grove Hall’s Ladder 23  one of the busiest fire houses in the city During his two decades in the department  Stallworth built a reputation as a team builder  a hard worker  and a person who never gives up “He always had his head in the books ’’ said Richard F  Paris  president of Boston Firefighters Local 718  who has known Stallworth since 1991 Stallworth said he took nine civil service promotional exams to climb through the ranks and was successful in four  He moved up from lieutenant to captain to district chief and now deputy chief He would go to a local McDonald’s or Dunkin’ Donuts to read books on hydraulics  fire science  building construction  and state general laws “People said it’s so noisy  how can you study there ’’ said Stallworth  “But it was the interruption that helped me ”He got joy from walking into an exam room knowing he could compete and eventually beat the other test takers  he said  “Where other people study for such things like power  I studied for the joy of the competition ’’ he said   I studied because I liked it ”Paris  the union chief  said the strain of studying can be a deterrent  and many people quit because it is tough  But Stallworth stuck with it “He earned it ’’ Parish said of the promotion  “He studied hard  It wasn’t given to him ”Stallworth’s promotion comes six days after Mayor Martin J  Walsh announced his administration is launching a national search for a new fire commissioner and as the Society of Vulcans begins its push to help increase the pool of new minority candidates  n', '2014_415')","('no

next five years The fact that there are a lot of banks getting ready to go public is an encouraging sign for our economy  Massachusetts banks that go public must remain independent for at least three years before they are merged or sold The line forming at the moment suggests that many bankers believe the economy of the next several years will be strong enough for them to grow and avoid serious

Polumbaum was careful to stress that by charging him as a youthful offender  prosecutors were not accusing the teenager of purposely killing his brother “It’s not an allegation of intentional murder ” said Polumbaum  “It’s a charge of wanton and reckless conduct causing death  Our view is  when you squeeze the trigger of a gun pointed toward a child less than a yard away  that even a minor would or should know the reasonable risk of harm inherent in that conduct ”Peña’s lawyer  Michael Doolin  declined to fight the bail amount  saying he understood the prosecution’s reasons for wanting to hold his client The teenager has a long history of trouble in school and with the law  At the time of the killing  Peña had stopped going to classes  though he was enrolled at Mildred Avenue Middle School

Colleen Ritzer  to move his case to juvenile court  rejecting his attorney’s contention that to try him as an adult would be unconstitutional “I think there is no case law either nationally or locally which supports the contention that our current statute governing juveniles charged with murder is unconstitutional ” said Judge Howard Whitehead  after a hearing that lasted about 35 minutes  t n“I think the argument is going to have to be presented at least to the SJC  maybe to the Supreme Court of the United States  and  frankly  might be more appropriate to the state Legislature ” he said Chism was 14 years old when he allegedly attacked Ritzer in a girls’ bathroom in October 2013 at the high school  raping and murdering her  and then dragging her body to a nearby wooded area  Hours later  Chism was found walking on Route 1 in Topsfield and was taken into custody Chism is being tried as an adult under state law and has pleaded not guilty to murder  aggravated rape  and other charges  He is being held without bail Defense attorney Denise Regan challenged the state’s juvenile offender law  which requires 14  to 17 year olds who face murder charges to be tried as adults “The Massachusetts system is wrong and it’s unconstitutional ” Regan said  “Children are different ” t nShe argued that the juvenile offender law violates Chism’s rights of the constitutional protections of equal protection  due process  fundamental fairness  and freedom from cruel and unusual punishment In court documents  Regan argued that Massachusetts’s juvenile offender law places it in the company of  “such stalwart defenders of human rights as Sudan and Somalia with regards to how we treat our children ”But Essex County Assistant District Attorney Kate MacDougall said Tuesday that the law was a “good law” that the state Legislature was entitled to enact  and in court documents called the comparison to Sudan and Somalia “ill informed  badly off base  and shameful ”She said in court Tuesday that Chism was accused of “objectively speaking  one of the most heinous and brutal murders that a person could possibly commit ” And she noted that under the state law affecting teenage murderers  Chism could be eligible for parole in as few as 15 years — before he is 30 years old “This defendant’s rights are amply protected ” MacDougall said Court documents filed by prosecutors Tuesday provide more detail on the brutality of his alleged attack on Ritzer According to the documents  on Oct  22  2013  Chism allegedly stayed after school with 24 year old Ritzer  who was in her second year as a math teacher  He was 6 foot 2  and 150 pounds  she was between 5 foot 3 and 5 foot 4 and weighed 135 pounds  He allegedly followed her into a bathroom  overpowered her  and asphyxiated her repeatedly while slashing her with a box cutter In the document  prosecutors graphically described the extent of wounds on her body Chism then allegedly raped Ritzer  put her body into a recycling bin  and then dumped her in the woods behind the school  prosecutors said On Tuesday  shackled hand and foot and dressed in khakis and a button down shirt and tie  Chism walked into court with his head down and did not look at anyone  He was composed and still throughout the proceedings Chism’s mother attended the hearing  and sat in the back row wearing sunglasses and a scarf  Members

lifted a history book  In fact  we’re still cashing in on the extraordinary achievements of the late 19th and early 20th centuries  a few short decades of radical innovation in every field — science  technology  economics  art  literature  religion  These breakthroughs rewrote our textbooks and rewired our cities  According to Steven Cassedy’s engaging new book  they also revised Americans’ self image  As the 20th century dawned  people could no longer imagine themselves as isolated creatures  beholden perhaps to family or church but otherwise quite independent and self determined  t The new technology bound us to one another through electric wires  water and sewer pipes  and transcontinental railroads  The new biology revealed deep genetic ties that bound all people to one another and to all living things  The economics of global trade put every workingman in direct competition with European and Asian rivals  As surely as present day city dwellers logging onto Google from their Roxbury living rooms  the Americans of a hundred years ago learned to think of themselves as wired into a series of networks  It’s a fascinating notion  though one that plays less of a role in the narrative of Cassedy  a professor at the University of California at San Diego  than I’d expected  Sometimes it seems he harps on the concept mainly to give an overarching theme to his lively work of scientific and intellectual history  Still  he’s on to something  While every human society has always been made up of social and economic networks  the technical innovations of a century ago bound us to brand new ones  while revealing longstanding connections we’d never noticed before As he surveys a 40 year period of relentless change  Cassedy divides his book into three sections to show how the new networked way of thinking first transformed our understanding of our own minds and bodies  then the economic system  and finally our view of culture and society  The work of Charles Darwin demonstrated that humans  far from being unique  were biologically bound to all other living things  Apart from the challenge this idea posed to traditional religion  evolutionary biology led to new ideas about human relationships  On the plus side  Darwinian ideas encouraged humanitarian movements aimed at the uplift of people of every class and nation  But the same ideas led progressive thinkers like Planned Parenthood founder Margaret Sanger to embrace eugenics  the idea of purifying the human network by preventing the birth of the “undesirable ”Luckily  most of the new network effects cited by Cassedy were far more benign  He shows how a new understanding of public health resulted in the complex water  power  and sewer systems we take for granted today  National railroad networks drove the development of a single national standard of timekeeping to ensure that trains could avoid slamming into one another  In the process  the railroads brought new consistency to the measurement of time and encouraging and making possible the precise synchronization of human activity — commercial  political  and personal Meanwhile  the expansion of US economic and military power connected the nation to new networks of worldwide trade  Globalization is an older phenomenon than you might think  Cassedy reminds us that by the early 20th century  American consumers routinely purchased products from every region of the earth — ivory from Congo  wool from Australia  bananas from Panama  We were learning to take for granted the benefits of life on an interconnected planet Cassedy regales us throughout with unexpected insights  There’s his observation that the late 19th century trend toward shorter hemlines began as a public health measure to prevent long dresses trailing unsanitary dust from city streets  Or the revelation that Americans got a head start on the sexual revolution  with one fifth of the nation’s high schools offering sex education courses as early as 1920 Indeed  this book is best read as a sprightly survey of social and technological transformation set in an era that makes our current high tech age seem relatively dull  America probably changed more between 1880 and 1920 than at any other time in the nation’s history  Cassedy does a fine job of showing us how and why', '2014_529')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article',

distinguish themselves and they associate with two nearby street gangs  the Rosewood Cardinals and Fabyan Falcons  Awad said The affidavit describes how street gangs are increasingly turning to sex trafficking as an easy way to make money and avoid the risk of criminal prosecution and stiff penalties that go along with selling illicit drugs and guns “Street gang members have become very wary of other means of illegal income  such as drug or gun sales ” she wrote  “In contrast  street gang members view pimping as unlikely to result in criminal prosecution and  in the event that it does  unlikely to result in any kind of penalty ”The Thetford Avenue Buffaloes are not thought to run a sex trafficking operation  Awad wrote  Rather  Pledger and Kizzie are believed to have acted

one of the most dangerous spots in Boston  when you talk about Morton Street ” nA neighbor who identified herself only as Elizabeth said she was in her back bedroom watching “Jerry Springer” when she heard a woman wailing outside  She ran to her second floor front porch and saw swarms of police cars outside “It’s just sad ’’ said Elizabeth  who lives next door to the victim’s family  “They should have been in school instead of home playing with guns ”Jason Milton  a 24 year old young father who also lives next door  said that when he heard of the shooting  he thought of his own family “I have

stopped by Morton Street following the incident State Representative Gloria Fox  who represents Roxbury  came by the home with a grief counselor  saying the tragedy cuts across the district and exemplifies the need for stricter measures to crack down on guns in the hands of young people “I don’t know where that gun came from  but it should not have been in that young boy’s hands ’’ she said  “We’ve got to stop the trafficking of guns into our neighborhoods ”State Representative Russell Holmes  who lives near the crime scene  pointed to the quadruple slaying on nearby Woolson Street in 2010 as an example of why new legislation on cracking down on gun trafficking is so critical “We don’t know if this was an illegal gun ’’ said Holmes  standing in front of the crime scene  “That will

Congressional District  struck a populist note as they rallied supporters inside a YMCA gymnasium to turn out the vote for Democrats at Tuesday’s election Appealing to the working class ethos of Lynn  a city Moulton lost in the September primary  Biden focused on income inequality and restoring opportunity to all Americans  t n“There used to be a level playing field ” Biden told the crowd of about 500 people  “There used to be a basic bargain in America supported by Republicans and Democrats alike  If you contributed to the success of the enterprise you worked with         you got to share in the profit ”The bargain has been broken and increasingly skewed to favor the rich  the vice president said  During Ronald Reagan’s presidency  a chief executive made an average of 42 times a worker’s wages  he said  today  he takes home 331 times the employee’s pay “Restoring the bargain is the defining issue of our time ” Biden said Moulton  a Harvard graduate who served four tours in Iraq before getting a dual graduate degree from Harvard’s Business School and Kennedy School of Government  focused on similar themes  demanding equal pay for women and minorities and increased resources for fellow veterans “I won’t mince words  Veterans’ care in America is a national embarrassment ” he said Advocating for universal prekindergarten  he said  “Your chance at success in life should not be dictated by the ZIP code in which you’re born ”Introducing the vice president  Moulton said  “Like me  he wasn’t born in privilege  but he’s had a passion for serving others his entire life  He’s someone who — no matter where he is — he never forgets the families that he’s served ”In a nod to the venue  Moulton said the Lynn YMCA “represents so much of what’s right in America  It’s a place where anyone can come to work  play  and be a part of the community  It’s a place where anyone can come for help  It’s a place where we take care of one another ”Moulton  who just turned 36  is a first time candidate who unexpectedly toppled 18 year Congressman John F  Tierney in the September primary  In Tuesday’s election  he faces Republican Richard Tisei and independent Chris Stockwell “A year ago  not many of us imagined we would all be here today ” Moulton acknowledged  “But we are here because we believe that we can help change Washington with some new leaders and new ideas ”Biden was scheduled to attend a fund raiser for Democratic gubernatorial candidate Martha Coakley at the Banshee in Dorchester later Wednesday  and a fund raiser for Moulton in Cambridge that an aide said was expected to raise up to $100 000 Tisei  who nearly beat Tierney two years ago and was considered a strong contender for a rematch  is waging a feisty battle and increasingly acrimonious ad war

happenstance that  and that his funeral at Most Precious Blood Parish in Hyde Park coincided with the closing hours of all the campaigns whose outcomes would be decided on Tuesday  But that unplanned juxtaposition couldn’t have illustrated more vividly the emotional extremes we resort to when it comes to political figures A newcomer watching the local TV news broadcasts in Boston early Monday morning might reasonably have concluded that the former mayor had been a hero of mythic proportions  a saint and a superstar whose goodness was unbounded and whose shortcomings were nonexistent   t nHours before the funeral began  the coverage was already wall to wall Menino  Reporters and camera crews were stationed not only at Faneuil Hall  where Menino had lain in repose on Sunday  and at the church where his funeral Mass would take place  but also at various locations along the route to be followed by the procession bearing Menino’s remains through the city  Bystanders were interviewed  and praised the late mayor unstintingly  Dignitaries were seen as they arrived to pay homage  Archival video clips showed Menino in moments of triumph and celebration  Appreciation and admiration overflowed for the politician who had ruled City Hall for two decades  Then the stations went to a commercial break  so that viewers could be told how rotten politicians are  With the election just a day away  one campaign spot followed another  and the bottom line in most of them was that the other guy stinks  If all you knew about  were what you picked up from their opponents’ ads  you would be revolted  Who could possibly want to vote for such vile cheats and greedy liars and haters of the common good  Why  they’re nothing but lackeys in the pocket of Wall Street  or stooges who ask “How high ” when Barack Obama tells them to jump  Richard Tisei is a right wing hater of veterans  Seth Moulton is a hypocrite backed by out of state billionaires  If Charlie Baker wins  everyone else loses  If Martha Coakley wins  taxes are going up  up  up  And then it was back to the  for Menino Voters worship politicians — or despise them  We extol them as demigods who can accomplish everything we crave — or revile them as crooks  drunk with power and self aggrandizement  Scandals involving public officials seem never ending  So do the outpourings of acclaim and adoration when powerful officeholders retire or die  The fulsome Menino coverage  interspersed with so many pre election attack ads  was a neat demonstration of the public’s bipolar response to those we entrust with political power  In a different way  the coverage also illustrated the contrast between the importance society and the media attributes to the death of politicians vs  the much more common shrug of insignificance when someone whose life wasn’t consumed with politics is laid to rest Watching the TV news early on Monday  I learned that Menino’s wasn’t the only funeral Mass at Most Precious Blood Parish that day  More than once  I heard a reporter or anchor mention that another burial was taking place first  which was why a hearse could be seen there long before Menino’s cortege had made its way to Hyde Park    Apparently no one thought that detail was important enough to mention  Her name was Mary Ann Carty  She was 75 and had been sick for years  but her physical weakness took nothing from her personality — or from her passion for Irish culture  She had been   the Irish Language Society of Boston  and remained an active member more than 40 years later  “My God  she was sassy ” her friend Molly Hester  a 24 year old graduate student in mechanical engineering who shared Ms  Carty’s love of Gaelic  told me on Monday  “She had such a great sense of humor  We would sit and have a pint together — I would drink Guinness and she would have a Sprite ” Another friend described her as “a great soul ” dryly funny and possessed of a remarkable memory — and always happy to “geek out” about the most effective ways to teach Irish Was Mary Carty’s death newsworthy  Granted  she wasn’t the longest serving mayor in Boston’s history  She didn’t wield political power  She wasn’t a celebrity  But she lived and was loved and left her own mark on this town  She and Tom Menino resided in the same neighborhood  died on the same day  and lay before the same altar as the prayers for absolution were said  Within hours of each other  they were buried in the same cemetery  Her passing may not have merited Page 1 coverage  Would it have been so hard to mention her name',

Common Core Curriculum standards  a potential ballot question on repealing the state’s casino law  and health care  a debate that was streamed online  nThey then gathered again  meeting Tuesday night at Roxbury Community College for a forum held by seven Democratic wards in Boston that stretch through the middle of the city and much of the black community “We have over 100 delegates from three wards that will be going to the convention ” Victoria Williams  the Ward 12 chairwoman  told the crowd gathered in the college’s media arts center  “Residents of Roxbury  Jamaica Plain  South End  Mission Hill  Dorchester  and Mattapan want to know who the candidates are  how they will tackle the issues facing us  and the agenda they will advance for the next four years ”About 200 people listened to the five candidates Tuesday night — and three lieutenant governor candidates before them — talk about the need to shrink the achievement gap in education  reform a criminal justice system with a disproportionate number of black men imprisoned  and reduce the number of guns at the root of so much urban violence The candidates each discussed their personal efforts to combat racism by leveling the proverbial playing field in jobs  housing  and education The two hour long forum  called “A Community Conversation with Democratic Candidates for Governor and Lieutenant Governor ” was moderated by Latoyia Edwards of NECN and Peniel Joseph  founding director of Tufts University’s Center for the Study of Race and Democracy  nUnlike earlier in the day when most of the gubernatorial candidates were uncharacteristically pointed in their criticism of Governor Deval Patrick and the state’s faulty health insurance website  there was near universal praise of the state’s first African American governor as the hopefuls answered the first question of the night about which of Patrick’s policies best aligned with their platform Donald M  Berwick and Attorney General Martha Coakley both applauded Patrick’s ability to combine efforts to reduce climate change with economic development  pointing to the state’s growing green tech industry Juliette Kayyem  a former Globe columnist  praised the governor’s work in veterans affairs  Joseph Avellone said Patrick has “an exciting vision  and I think we’re on the right path” with closing the achievement gap  And State Treasurer Steve Grossman extolled Patrick’s proposal to limit people in Massachusetts to buying one gun per month There was rousing applause from some sections of the auditorium when Berwick pledged to move Massachusetts to a single payer health insurance system  which is essentially like Medicare for all  It is a cornerstone issue for his campaign The mention of Coakley’s battle against the federal Defense of Marriage Act and her efforts to end predatory lending in communities of color received an equal response Still  there were those delegates in attendance Tuesday night who remained unsure

think I have a little more thinking to do ” said Shaikh Hasib  who helped coordinate Tuesday’s forum and is a member of the Ward 12 Democratic Committee in Roxbury But listening to the candidates’ views on such things as figuring out how to provide funding so that all the state’s youngsters can attend prekindergarten  gave the 26 year old valuable insight “on where the candidates stood on

morning  Dorothy Boswell kept an eye on the clock  For the first time in two decades  Boston had a new mayor  and Boswell wanted to get home to watch his inauguration speech on television Boswell did not vote for Martin J  Walsh  but she is hopeful he will do well   n“If he does like Menino  he’ll be all right ” said the 80 year old Across the city Monday  many echoed that sentiment  saying they were optimistic Walsh would prove to be a worthy successor to the popular Menino — at least in time  They celebrated the first victory by a Dorchester native in half a century and said they looked forward to change that lay ahead “The groundwork is there ” said Dave Johnson  51  of the South End  “He doesn’t have to be Menino  as long as he is good to the people ”In Savin Hill  where Walsh grew up and still lives  excitement over his inauguration ran high  At Dorchester Tire Service  a small group gathered around a television to watch Walsh being sworn in “There he is ” said John Mullaney  a city worker who brought his truck to the shop with a flat tire “Is that his mother  Johnny ’’ asked Joe Dillon  a fellow city worker  as he stood close to the screen Mullaney  from Adams Corner in Dorchester  said he has come to admire Walsh  his labor pedigree  and his roots in the neighborhood  As he watched him become mayor  he spoke with pride “He’s from Dorchester  he’s a local guy  and he’s a working guy ’’ said Mullaney  a supervisor of construction in the city’s public works department At the shop  and elsewhere across the city  Walsh’s inauguration was cause for celebration and a time to look ahead “There is a lot of hope here ’’ said David Skirkey  a South Boston resident who works as a guard at the Museum of Fine Arts  “It’s that kind of day ”Amid the excitement  however  was the keen awareness that succeeding Menino could well be daunting for Walsh and that expectations are often dashed by political realities “It’s a huge task that is before him ’’ said Al Flynt  an advocate for the homeless who lives in Dorchester  nFrom Dudley to Copley Square  many people said they were confident that the city is headed in the right direction  But they urged the new mayor to be aggressive with plans to reduce crime  spur job growth  and improve the public schools “We need a better education system ” said Theresa Garrison  61  “A lot of families have to leave the city for better schools  and that’s not right ”Garrison  who lives in Roxbury  said she expected Walsh to bring new ideas to City Hall and hopes he will listen to a wide range of constituencies “You have to reach out to everybody ” she said  “You can’t just hear one voice ”Like many residents  Garrison said she had mi  emotions about Walsh’s inauguration  She said she would miss Menino  who after so many years in office had become a familiar  reassuring presence  At the same time  Walsh’s arrival holds the promise of a new era “I think he’ll do great ” said Charles Leon  34  as he paused along Washington Street in the South End On the heels of the busy holiday season and a snowstorm  many city residents admitted that the inauguration had slipped their mind and said they had given little thought to city politics since the November election  But now that Walsh has taken office  they said they look forward to seeing the kind of mayor he will be At McKenna’s Café in Savin Hill  where Walsh is a regular  diners described him as a neighborhood fixture with a down to earth quality they said would serve him well “He’s been a real part of the community  and not in a showy way ” said Larry Pryor  who has lived in Savin Hill for 30 years  “You get the feeling that he’s one of us ”But now that Walsh is Boston’s mayor  his everyman appeal will only take him so far  some warned “I

centers to breathe new life into  t nThat’s a big change from where he found himself last fall  After losing the preliminary election  he no longer had a job  He could not return to his role on the City Council  He said he felt at once liberated and scared about his prospects “It was the first time that I didn’t have a plan as to what my next step would be ’’ said Arroyo But he regrouped  He called the two top contenders  Walsh and John Connolly  both of whom were trying to woo him  And he wasted little time in throwing his support behind Walsh Both he and Walsh were strong advocates for marginalized residents  including the poor and addicts in recovery  Arroyo said “In the campaign  I just went in feet first  I went in as hard as I could to help in his election because I really believe what he was about ’’ Arroyo said Walsh rewarded Arroyo for his efforts  He picked him to help lead his transition team  and surprised many when he named Arroyo  along with his chief of staff Dan Arrigg Koh  among his first two Cabinet picks Arroyo said he was surprised by the appointment “I didn’t ask him too much about how everything else was shaping up  and so I was surprised when it was Dan Koh and then me  But I’m very grateful  I’m happy to be on his team ’’ Arroyo said  “I’m a kid from Hyde Park living the dream right now ” n nJohn Barros didn’t win the mayoral race but works

and licenses  small  local business enterprises  jobs and community service  and tourism  sports  and entertainment “Running for mayor allowed me to hear from all parts of the city  from residents in all of our neighborhoods  about the things that they care about particularly around economic development ” Barros said He rattled off a list of concerns heard out on the campaign trail that included jobs  access to capital  lending practices  government services  overdevelopment  underdevelopment  and the permitting process “In many ways  I heard about many of the same issues that Mayor Walsh is trying to address ” he said Not only does Barros’s new role mean visiting the city’s neighborhoods  it also involves travel around the country and the globe  He’s been to Las Vegas  California  Washington  D C  China  Israel  and Dubai “We’re putting more of an emphasis on strengthening our city’s relationships across the globe         to open up business relationships and foster education

months since his unsuccessful bid for mayor “I’m going to keep doing what I’ve always done and that’s advocate for my people  advocate for my community  and advocate for the underserved ” he said recently in an interview  “Nothing really has changed ”Except  perhaps  for one thing  TOUCH 106 1 FM  the unlicensed radio station Clemons cofounded based in Grove Hall  was shut down by the federal government  Now  the only place to catch the so called fabric of the black community is online But Clemons is fighting to bring community radio to Boston’s black neighborhoods  which currently do not have a 24 hour station  He used the skills he picked up on the campaign trail to help push for the successful passage of ballot question Number 5 in the Seventh Suffolk Representative District  which is represented by state Representative Gloria Fox The question  Shall the state representative from this district be instructed to vote in favor of legislation to facilitate the licensing of low power radio stations in underserved communities “We were out at the polls  We had fliers and robocalls going on ” Clemons said  “I guess running for mayor did increase my civic engagement  Look at that ” nSuffolk District Attorney Dan Conley went straight back work soon after losing the election “I was putting in 18 hour days on the campaign  but I could never take my eye off the ball on what was happening in my office ’’ Conley said in an interview recently Indeed  less than a week before the Sept  24 preliminary election vote  Conley was overseeing prosecution of the largest Ponzi scheme in a century  His attorneys indicted Steven and Lori Palladino and their son Gregory  alleging the West Roxbury family fleeced 42 families of more than $10 million  Conley alleged they used their clients’ money to finance their own lavish lifestyle The Palladinos pleaded guilty in January and were sentenced In the year since the race  Conley also won the convictions of two Roxbury men under the state’s new human trafficking law  And in September  Conley made headlines when he hired Indy  a 2 year old golden retriever and Labrador mix  whose job is to comfort people in emotional distress A year after the campaign  Conley said he is happy to be back fully focused on the job he loves “I was able to catch my breath ’’ Conley said  reflecting on the end of his mayoral bid  “I just went back do doing what I’ve always done for the past 12 years ” nFormer city councilor John Connolly has steered clear of politics after losing a razor thin general election contest with Walsh He has spent the year focused on his passion for education reform and spending more time with his family “I’ve gone to a lot of youth soccer games and spending a lot of time at the ice rink with my kids ’’ he said  “And that’s been great ”He also joined the board at Fuel Education  a group that helps low income families save for college  And he joined with the National Center on Time   Learning  where he’s working on launching his own nonprofit The former councilor from West Roxbury was an early front runner in the mayoral race when Thomas M  Menino announced he would not seek a sixth term  He was seen as the best established  best financed candidate in the large field  He trounced most of his opponents  placing second in the preliminary election and was a favorite to win the general election But then the tables turned  Walsh began lining up a series of key endorsements  including many of Connolly’s colleagues on the council  and secured a surge of union money Connolly came close  but Walsh won “I came out of it wiser  ‘’ Connolly said of the campaign  “I learned a lot about myself  I learned a lot about the city  I learned a lot about politics ”He is not ready to share what he has learned just yet but insists he has no regrets about charging ahead and seeking the office of mayor “I wish I had won  but there is a lot of blessings in losing ’’ Connolly said  noting the extra time he now has to devote to his young children Connolly did share a few kind words for the man now serving as mayor  saying he is confident Walsh will do a good job for the city  nRob Consalvo  a former Hyde Park district councilor  is settling into his new role as deputy director of the Home Center  a crucial link to the execution of Walsh’s housing policy A councilor for more than a decade  Consalvo returned to City Hall recently to work with city housing chief Sheila Dillon as her new deputy director for the center Consalvo will oversee a staff of 37 employees and manage a divisional budget of $11 million  Based in the Department of Neighborhood Development  Consalvo will lead efforts to help create financial initiatives to help seniors stay in their homes  increase the access of more middle income Bostonians to home ownership opportunities  and assist residents in making their homes greener and more energy efficient “I am very excited to return to city government ” Consalvo told the Globe after his appointment Consalvo left his council job to run for mayor  but was never able to break free from the pack and lost in the preliminary election  Afterward he dropped out of public view  but was seen last month outside a Hyde Park polling station urging voters to support Attorney General Martha Coakley for governor Then late last month  Walsh tapped Consalvo for the new $96 000 a year post  nSince finishing third in last year’s mayoral race  Charlotte Golar Richie has kept a somewhat low profile In the days immediately following the preliminary election  Golar Richie  the only woman in the 12 person race  used her standing — she finished just 3 889 votes behind the number two — to help Walsh get elected to office and then helped with his transition Then she retreated from the public eye  making select appearances at events such as the Whittier Street Health Center’s Black History Month Celebration and the Louis D  Brown Peace Institute’s annual Mother’s Day Walk for Peace  In March  she was elected to the Tufts Health Foundation Board  where she provides counsel on grants and policy But this summer the former aide to Mayor Thomas M  Menino and Governor Deval Patrick returned to public service as one of three commissioners of the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination  Patrick appointed her to the commission in June and she was sworn in with her husband and two daughters by her side in August  In her new role  she investigates discrimination in employment  housing  and public accommodations  nThe last year has brought a lot of change for Mike Ross  who was a city councilor before running for mayor For starters  he no longer lives in the district he represented for 14 years  moving from Mission Hill to East Boston “I now live on the water in East Boston  in a new loft condo that was just built ” he said  “I go running on bike paths and running paths throughout East Boston  I eat some of the greatest food that exists anywhere  I love the people  It’s exactly where the city is heading in a very positive way ”Ross  an attorney since 2007  is practicing construction and real estate law at firm of Prince Lobel  and says the work puts him back in City Hall and before community groups often He worked with the MBTA’s and Walsh’s late night service and transportation efforts  helping to organize the first post midnight event — a food truck festival on the Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy Greenway — in recent memory  And he has become a regular contributor to the opinion pages of The Boston Globe And  recently  Ross  whose father is a Holocaust survivor  was appointed by the president to be a member of the US Holocaust Memorial Council “So  I’m a council member again ” he said  nBill Walczak was healthy before he ran for mayor  But as soon as his campaign was over  he realized he’d lost weight  He had developed a nasty respiratory infection that wouldn’t go away  And he felt totally broken down  It was like his body was trying to tell him something  The executive at Shawmut Construction and Design got to thinking that it was time for a change Walczak  whose blood runs deep in community activism  decided to return to the work he loves  On Nov  3  he became president of the Lewis Family Foundation  which aims to ensure that students in Mattapan  Dorchester  and Roxbury make it through college  He is also heading the global charitable initiative Grand Circle Foundation Walczak said that in some ways  his run for mayor opened his eyes to the challenges facing Bostonians “I’m never going to run again ’’ he said  “I learned so much about the city  I got to meet some great people who care so much about this city  And I learned a lot about myself ”A “big ideas” man  Walczak spent more than four decades as an activist in his beloved Codman Square  where he founded the now thriving health center and Codman Academy Charter Public School He was president of Carney Hospital and  most recently  vice president of community relations at Shawmut Design and Construction After the campaign  he took up singing  a beloved pastime  He paused briefly last week to reflect on the year after his failed bid for mayor  saying returning to advocacy has been the best post campaign gift “It felt natural for me ’’ he said  “It feels like I’m back in the area I know well ” nThe most elusive candidate in the mayoral race returned to the ballot this month  this time in an unsuccessful challenge to state Senator Sonia Chang Diaz  who represents Jamaica Plain  Roxbury  Mission Hill  and the South End Like last year  David James Wyatt essentially did not campaign  There was no campaign literature to speak of  and his now defunct website remained outdated for much of the election cycle  saying in May that he was running for mayor of Boston His platform during the mayor’s race was boiled down to this  He was the only Republican in the race and he was against abortion The Roxbury resident  who could not be reached for comment despite attempts by phone  rarely appeared on the trail in 2013  making only a handful of public appearances  The same was true in this year’s Senate race His campaign account is negative $3 125  according to campaign finance records  and he’s amassed $50 in fines for failing to fill out his reports on time  nCharles Yancey did not give up his long held council seat when he ran for mayor  But when voters went to the polls  it was clear how they wanted him to serve  He received three times more votes for City Council than for mayor And that’s fine with Yancey  who has spent 31 years as a councilor from Mattapan  He’s seen disappointments before  having run twice unsuccessfully for the council as well as for Congress and state auditor “I was humbled ’’ he said in an interview this week  “I truly appreciate every vote I received in that election and all the other previous ones          Maybe they did me a favor for not voting for me for mayor  I don’t know  but I certainly enjoy representing the people of Boston in whatever capacity they want me to represent them ”Yancey  dogged in his pursuit for the causes he champions  went right back to work on the council after the preliminary election And he picked up where he had left off  calling at least a half dozen audit hearings to press the new administration to address race and gender disparities at the upper ranks  He sought answers about the city’s fiscal practices and pushed to block a high security research laboratory from opening in Boston He has not always been successful in his efforts  but Yancey is known for not giving up  Recently  he got some traction in his bid to open a high school in Mattapan  though that effort has since stalled Will he run for another office Yancey said he’s not sure “I haven’t had an opportunity to think about that  I gave people an opportunity and they clearly  had their say  ’’ he said  “I’m not going to rule anything in or out at this stage ”',

he wasn’t out  n“Good hit ” “Nice catch ”To the cheers and applause of parents and coaches  Hollywood took a home run trot around the bases at Kelly Field in Norwood  blowing imaginary smoke from the tip of his finger as if it were the barrel of gun At Norwood’s Little League Challenger program  where the players are special needs children and young adults  everyone can run the bases no matter where their ball ends up The baseball season ends Sunday  but there will be more games to play  Flag football  cheerleading  basketball  and soccer are part of the program to keep the participants busy year round The Norwood  and Foxborough based program  which began in 1992  is part of the Challenger Division of the national Little League organization  and its 80 or so players come from two dozen communities stretching from Easton to Holliston to Hyde Park in Boston  nChallenger groups are sprinkled throughout Massachusetts  but Norwood’s is the largest in the state  said Margaret Chaisson  Norwood Challenger’s communications director “Most of them are 20 kids or less  and we’re about four times that size ” Chaisson said  “It’s partly because we’re regional and we reach out to the whole area  and partly that we’ve been around for a long time ”The longevity of the group  which she attributed to committed parents and coaches  has allowed it to make connections with other groups and hold games and small tournaments regionally  she said Norwood’s program is also unique in that it offers sports throughout the year  while most Little League Challenger programs stick to baseball  said Bob Smith  one of the local group’s organizers The group began with baseball and “it took off just like wildfire  we had six teams in a matter of a few years ” said Smith  “There is a need for it  and there is always going to be a need for it ”Smith’s special needs son  Rob  was 10 when the program began   He had been in a traditional Little League program  but the play was beginning to get competitive “Once you get around 10 years old  kids are pitching now and they want to compete ” Smith said  “Although they were nice to my son  my son would be a sure out  and that’s not fair to them  and not fair to my son ”Now 31  Rob doesn’t play anymore  Players in the Challenger Division range in age from 6 to around 30  but no one is forced to stop playing when they reach a certain age  Smith said At the game in Norwood this month  parents and coaches said that people hear about the program mostly through word of mouth  with a big assist from Chaisson Chaisson uses her extensive e mail list to keep parents notified  Before Chaisson got involved  organizers had to make about 100 calls before every game  said Rick Reardon  one of the organizers Geri Sheehan of Mansfield  watching the game from the bleachers  said her son Tom is nearly 30  As he ran to first after hitting the ball  she cheered  “That’s my guy  Good job ”Born with a coordination disorder called dyspraxia  Tom Sheehan lacks motor coordination and was 7 years old before he could speak  his mother said  His two sisters participated in sports  but she couldn’t find a way to get Tom involved until she heard about the Challenger Program from another Mansfield parent “What was wonderful about this program was he was able to get up there with the tee at the beginning and be encouraged ” Sheehan said  “He never felt badly about what he was doing  and 17 years later  he is still participating in all of the sports they do ”Barbara Richardson of Norwood said her son Brian has likewise taken advantage of the program for many years  Now 19  he looks forward to it every year and never misses a game unless he is sick  she said “Everyone has a chance to hit the ball  no matter how long it takes  and feel that sense of accomplishment of running the bases and making it to home ” Richardson said Nanci Walsh of Walpole said her 7 year old son  Coleman  has done well in his first year with the program Coleman has learned how to play the game because coaches broke it down into steps he could understand  Walsh said  In school  Coleman is in an integrated classroom  but Walsh said there are advantages in a recreation program consisting entirely of people with special needs “It’s great to see he can be satisfied and achieve success at a basic level ” Walsh said  “If it’s a program that’s not accommodating  he’ll get very discouraged by it ”Norfolk resident Tom Klejna has been bringing his 18 year old son  Thomas  to Challenger sports for five years   n“We started with basketball and went on with baseball and now he’s involved with soccer ” Klejna said of his son While his son is the one playing  Klejna said he gets a lot out of the program as well  In speaking to parents of special needs children  he has learned about other programs and activities  and can compare notes about education and parenting The games also give parents a break from caring for their children  Richardson said  Her son has epilepsy and requires attention throughout the day  but during sports he is supervised by the coaches and Richardson can be a spectator “Coming here  it’s almost like taking a breath of fresh air ” Richardson said  “It’s a time we can let all of that go for an hour and be in a community of people who understand and accept  I can rejuvenate and become more energized before I go home and deal with what I need to deal with ”The program has helped volunteers who aren’t related to the players Sarah Lussier  a freshman at Bridgewater State University  said her involvement with the Challenger teams has led to her decision to pursue a career as a special education teacher Lussier started while she was a student at Norwood High School and said coaching has been both enjoyable and meaningful “I love these kids — they bring more joy to me than I could bring to them ” Lussier said Smith said high school students often help out with coaching and that regular Little League teams sometimes watch the games and cheer on the players Community support is also provided by such donors as the Norwood Elks  Harvard Pilgrim Health Care  and Ernie Boch Jr   nBoys and girls can participate in any of Norwood’s Challenger sports  but coaches Julie and David Price decided five years ago to split the girls into a softball team  which plays weekly after the baseball game Through that team  the girls have formed closer friendships  with campfire outings  pizza nights  and social dances  Julie Price said David Price added that even in the world of special needs sports  girls can get marginalized  “This  softball  team allowed them to be themselves a bit more and relax a bit more ” he said Once per season  the girls play against the boys  which gets players on both sides pumped up for the competition  But like all Challenger Division games  no one keeps score   n“Every game is a tie ” Reardon said  “Everybody wins ”', '2014_749')","('no article',

summer vacation  our tireless  selfless  oh so humble representatives in Congress managed to pass a bill that will inject some $17 billion and a measure of flexibility into the Veterans Administration After clearing the House  the bill passed the Potomac Millionaires Club  otherwise known as the Senate  91 to 3  which means all but a few of those 41 Republicans who enthusiastically sent Americans to war but cynically refused to pay for their wounds suddenly got religion  t nThe same people who five months ago refused to give more money to cut down the disgraceful waits vets face at the VA changed their minds  Maybe they finally got the memo that an average of 22 vets a day are killing themselves nationwide The $17 billion amounted to a compromise between the chairmen of the veterans services committees in the Republican led House and Democrat controlled Senate  Senator Bernie Sanders  my favorite Vermont socialist  wanted $25 billion  Representative Jeff Miller of Florida wanted it capped at $10 billion  After some bickering  they split the difference  Given what passes for compromise on Capitol Hill these days  I am nominating Sanders and Miller for the Nobel Prize for common sense That said  all the money can’t undo the VA’s biggest problem — it has become a huge  unwieldy bureaucracy  and bureaucracies are not made to deal with crises like the one facing American veterans It is beyond disgraceful that those of the next greatest generation  the men and women who served in Iraq and Afghanistan  have returned to a country that can’t or won’t take care of them  They are victims of politicians who love to send other kids to fight wars they wouldn’t dream of sending their own to fight As Sanders put it the other day  “Planes and tanks and guns are a cost of war  So is taking care of the men and women who use those weapons and fight our battles ” t nJames Palmer could have told him that  Palmer grew up in Milton  just over the Mattapan line  He tried college for a year but it wasn’t for him at the time  Nine years ago  with two wars raging  he walked into the Army recruiting office on Tremont Street  across from the Common  and asked the guy behind the desk  “What have you got for me ”Quite a challenge  it turned out  Army Rangers are as good as they get  and Palmer wanted to be a Ranger  He earned his tab in the searing heat at Fort Benning  and in being assigned to the Third Battalion  75th Ranger Regiment  he became part of an elite force that worked only at night  seeking what they call high value targets  bad guys who kill Americans and anybody else who crosses them Palmer did four combat tours in Afghanistan  Over the last five years  he spent as much time in Afghanistan as he did in the United States  He saw Afghanistan almost exclusively through the green fog of night vision glasses  chasing bad guys  He used a shoulder fired  84 mm recoilless rifle that boomed next to his head like a cannon When he got home  Palmer had trouble socializing as he had before  An acquaintance came up to him and said  “So sorry you had to be there ” Palmer was angry “This is something I signed up for  I’m proud of my service ” he said  “More than anything  I’m proud of the people I served with  People say stuff and don’t realize it’s really insulting  But  with our military training  we’re not going to go off on someone  Instead  we withdraw  We isolate ourselves ”Palmer found himself doing just that and simultaneously developed a case of debilitating migraines  His head pounded  When he managed to fall asleep  his vivid dreams were punctuated by screams Palmer was lucky in two respects  First  he had a supportive partner  his fiancee  Courtney Clayton  Secondly  and in part because of Courtney  he found   the program that helps vets suffering from the invisible wounds of war   nPalmer had gone to the VA in March  complaining of symptoms that were classic signs of traumatic brain injury and post traumatic stress  The VA said it couldn’t give him an MRI until June “I couldn’t wait three months ” he said  “I was really hurting ”Instead he went to Home Base and immediately got an MRI  a diagnosis  and a full work up with a terrific young doctor named Seth Herman  He got meds for his headaches  He got his life back “Home Base is what the VA should be ” Palmer said  “Your first contact is with fellow vets  It’s small enough to be personal  It’s not a bureaucracy  It’s responsive  In combat  you have to improvise  Same in health care ”The VA can’t handle it all  We need more Home Base type programs  everywhere  We need light infantry units of care  in every state I asked Palmer why he was willing to talk to me  to forfeit his privacy  and he spoke simply and directly  like a Ranger “The stigma has to go  If one vet reads my story and says  ‘Hey  that guy seems OK  If he can admit he needed help  I can admit it ’ If one vet comes forward and gets help  that would be worth

described the crash that ended the life of Grendalee Alvarado’s 7 year old daughter  the heartbroken mother wiped tears from her eyes  When the defense attorney for Olivia Mora said Mora has only

chapter stemming from their unexpected meeting Nov  26  when an allegedly drunk Mora careered through a Dorchester neighborhood before crashing into Alvarado as she walked along Olney Street holding the hand of her daughter  Brianna Rosales  n nAfter seeing Mora for the first time since the crash  Alvarado said she had hoped that Mora might try  in some way  to apologize for killing her daughter “But I don’t see sorry ’’ Alvarado told reporters after Mora’s arraignment  where Mora was held on $150 000 bail Alvarado said she has only limited memories of the moment  captured by a surveillance camera  when the light colored Chevrolet Tahoe veered from the street in the Fields Corner area and bore down on mother and daughter “She was a nice girl ” Alvarado said of her daughter  as she broke down again  “Always happy  Always taking care of everybody ’’Accompanying Alvarado  26  was her family and Revere attorney Joseph Machera  who said he has been trying to find a way for Alvarado to pay off the hundreds of thousands of dollars in medical bills for injuries sustained in the crash  She has had multiple surgeries and four strokes since the crash  he said  n“Every day is a nightmare for her ’’ Machera said  He said Alvarado often dreams that her daughter is alive  but then wakes to the bitter reality “She’s not so much angry as she just wonders why it had to be  them  ’’ Machera said In court  Suffolk Assistant District Attorney Masai King said police concluded that Mora was driving her sport utility vehicle well over the 30 mile per hour speed limit at the time of impact King also said that after the crash Mora insisted to police that she had not been drinking  But he said a blood sample showed that her blood alcohol level nine hours after the crash was  125  well above the legal limit of  08  King noted that a State Police chemist calculated that Mora’s blood alcohol level was between  188 and  386 at the time of the crash Mora  who walked slowly into the courtroom with the aid of a cane  spoke only when she replied not guilty to numerous charges  including manslaughter by a motor vehicle Defense attorney John Pavlos told Trial Magistrate Gary D  Wilson that the State Police report contained a factual error  a wrong time element in describing the blood tests  leading him to question how many more he might discover once an expert on alcohol toxicity examines the report At the time of the crash  the 36 year old Mora was thought to be living in Dorchester  Pavlos said Mora is a California native who has lived in Massachusetts continuously since 1999 after she was granted a full scholarship to Babson College  from which she graduated  He said Mora was trained in “guerrilla marketing’’ and had incorporated a company in New Hampshire It was Pavlos’s discussion about Mora’s love for her own daughter and the loss she has felt since her arrest  that prompted Mora’s tears  Pavlos said that at the time of the crash  Mora was a single mother who devoted most of her days to caring for her daughter Since last November  he said  Mora has seen her daughter for just 20 minutes  The child is in the custody of the Department of Children and Families Alvarado said she understood the importance of Mora being able to mother her own child  “For one point it’s fair  for another point it’s not ’’ she said  “because she took the life of my daughter ’’',

Neapolitan style pizzeria with marble tables and cool gray walls A rooftop garden provides the duo with organic herbs  several varieties of lettuce  kale  beets  carrots  heirloom tomatoes  dandelions  radishes  and eggplant  The crop supplies the kitchen with about half the produce it uses in summer and fall  “We’re roof to table ” says O’Toole  35  What they don’t grow comes from local farmers  t

dome shaped brick oven behind the bar  The 6 000 pound  wood fired cooker came from Naples  and was handmade by Stefano Ferrara  a third generation Neapolitan oven builder revered by pizza makers worldwide  The 1 000 degree oven bakes a pizza in 90 seconds  and turns out a remarkably tender  chewy crust  beautifully charred and blistered  There are about 50 Ferrara ovens in this country  says O’Toole  His is the only one on the Cape A pistachio pesto pie  spread with the creamy sauce  made with spinach and pistachios  is layered with fresh mozzarella  When it’s cooked  a mound of arugula  ground pistachios  and a drizzle of lemon vinaigrette goes on top  The crust warms the greens  the combination of textures and tastes is delicious  The finely ground flour the chef imports from a family mill in Northern Italy gives the crust flavor Another pizza is made with wild mushrooms  garlic cream sauce  and smoked mozzarella  then sprinkled with truffle oil  A deep  earthy fragrance fills the restaurant when it comes out of the oven  “Customers say the smell is intoxicating ” says Ali O’Toole  34  who runs the front of the house House made ricotta  mozzarella  caramelized onions  black olives  and tender meatballs crown another pizza  A margherita pie with fresh San Marzano tomatoes  mozzarella  Parmesan  and basil is a simple and light rendition of the classic The restaurant’s crop is also used for salads and appetizer specials  They might include a dish of roasted baby carrots  and shaved chioggia  golden and red beets with herb buttermilk dressing  Or

the source of DNA found after an alleged rape  While the judge may harbor doubts about the reliability of new tests  the scientific evidence appears compelling enough to warrant the 12 week continuance of the case requested by the prosecutors A suspect  Dwayne McNair  has been charged with raping two women at gunpoint in 2004  just eight days apart  One alleged victim  who was abducted while walking on a Roxbury street  had the presence of mind to retain a condom used by the perpetrator  That sample eventually identified McNair as a potential source of the DNA  But prosecutors couldn’t differentiate between that sample and one offered voluntarily by the suspect s identical twin brother  Dwight  It’s the same dilemma faced by law enforcement worldwide when confronted with cases involving one of a pair of twins who develop from a single fertilized egg    nBut Suffolk prosecutors now believe that science has caught up to any criminal who tries to hide behind a genotype shared with an identical twin  Earlier this month  according to court documents  the trial prosecutor learned of a new procedure by a genomic testing company  Eurofins  proclaiming a “ ’’ A scholarly journal   as did a Harvard genetics professor who reviewed the paper at the prosecutor’s request McNair is scheduled to go on trial on April 29  But the DA wants a 12 week continuance  which will allow sufficient time for Eurofins to test his DNA sample  Judge McEvoy  however  has become impatient  In her April 16 ruling denying the request  she cited the novelty of proposed evidence “that has never been permitted in any court in the United States’’ and “is not generally accepted in the scientific community ’’McEvoy is a highly respected jurist  But the best path to justice in this case would be for her to examine expert witnesses as to the reliability and accuracy of the new testing procedures  Simply stating that the next generation sequencing test is not “generally accepted’’ by scientists does not make it so Whichever inconveniences arise from a delay of a few months in this case  they pale if compared with the public’s interest in seeing that the best available evidence of a defendant’s guilt — or innocence — is presented at trial', '2014_1047')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article',

with the Securities and Exchange Commission  and David Cotney  the state’s commissioner of banks  expects at least one other to convert from private to public ownership  nBlue Hills Bank of Hyde Park filed with the SEC last week for a stock sale to raise nearly $240 million  It was the largest of the community banks to file for IPOs last week  joined by Melrose Cooperative Bank and Pilgrim Bank of Cohasset  which expect to raise $28 5 million and $17 7 million  respectively East Boston Savings Bank  which sold a minority share in stock in 2008  announced earlier this month that it will sell more stock to become completely shareholder owned This rush to go public is another sign of the tough conditions facing banks these days  Low interest rates continue to eat into bank profits  while the costs of complying with new regulations and investing in online and mobile technology to compete with larger institutions are only growing  It has forced many community banks to raise more capital  particularly through IPOs  said Daniel Forte  president of the Massachusetts Bankers Association “It’s an evolution of the banking industry ” Forte said  “Clearly this environment is a challenging one   Profit  margins are thin ”But bank conversions to stock companies aren’t always good for customers  said Suzanne Moot  a Milton bank consultant  Many of these banks will probably be sold to larger institutions after the required three year waiting period  she said  leaving local businesses and residents with fewer banking options  nThe state has lost a quarter of its banks since 2000  according to the Massachusetts Bankers Association  Of the 175 banks left  nearly three quarters are mutually owned for the benefit of depositors Moot said there’s no evidence that the new capital raised by the banks in stock offerings benefits the community  in terms of increasing lending  introducing new products and services  or hiring more workers “It’s not about the community ” she said  “It’s about the management and the board ”Sales after conversions can lead to big payouts for shareholders  including the bank’s top executives and directors  For example  three years and 11 days after Danversbank became publicly traded  People’s United Financial Inc  of Connecticut announced that it had agreed to buy the bank  In 2011  the year of the sale  Kevin Bottomley  the former Danvers chief executive  earned $12 4 million in compensation  got $3 6 million for canceling some unexercised stock options  and also received shares of People’s United  according to the bank’s filings Not all mutual banks go public to sell to bigger institutions  said Kenneth Ehrlich  an attorney and cochairman of the banking practice at Boston law firm Nutter McClennen   Fish By raising additional capital  some of these banks can hire more loan officers to increase lending  invest in technology  or even finance new branches and acquire other banks  he said  Many smaller banks are still struggling in the aftermath of the recent financial crisis and recession  he said  and without the additional capital some may not survive “Anything that happens that hurts a community bank’s viability isn’t a good thing for a community ” Ehrlich said  “But I can’t draw a connection between going public and hurting the community ”Still  with relatively few publicly traded banks in Massachusetts  larger institutions that are looking to grow will watch the ones that have issued IPOs  Ehrlich said  By going public  mutual banks can be bought by other institutions  otherwise they are only allowed to merge with other mutual banks “A small bank that converts is likely to be an acquisition target reasonably soon after three years from the conversion date ” Erhlich said  “Because bigger banks want to grow and there’s a relatively small inventory of stock banks for sale ”Forte  with the Massachusetts Bankers Association  said this recent flurry of IPOs is unlikely to spell the demise of community banks in the state  There are several community banks with shareholders that have remained financially strong and haven’t been sold  Forte said “Everyone has forecasted the demise of community banks ” Forte said  “I think they’ve been adaptable  they’ve found ways to succeed ”', '2014_654')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no

suggest turning a former library into a youth center  several neighbors stood to voice their opposition  Teens would inevitably misbehave and disrupt the quiet residential area  they argued At the other end of the table  then 15 year old twin sisters Melissa and Vanessa Simplice sank lower in their chairs  quietly seething  n“They were saying  ‘We don’t want this  When the library was here  the teens did bad stuff like loitering ’ ‘Oh  the kids act wild ’ u2002” Melissa remembered on Saturday  “We were like  gosh  we’re not that bad ”“We got kind of mad ” Vanessa said  Fighting their nervousness at the thought of rebuking a roomful of adults  she said  the girls stood up  “We had something to say ”Saturday  the Simplices — along with Mayor Martin J  Walsh  other city officials  elected representatives  and supporters — attended a groundbreaking ceremony for a new Boys   Girls Club of Boston teen center at the former Mattapan library on Hazelton Street Renovations to the compact but elegant 1930s era library building are underway  The center  slated to serve 125 teens each day when it opens this fall  will include a quiet space for doing homework  a kitchen  a technology room  a stage for arts performances  and even a music studio  The work is being funded by a $2 5 million grant from the Richard and Susan Smith Foundation and will preserve many of the building’s original architectural details When the center opens in October  “we’ll be coming to try to be leaders in our community ” Melissa said  “We’ll be going to apply to college  doing homework  You’re not going to see any of that  misbehavior  around there ” nThe groundbreaking was a victory not only for the Simplices  now 16  but also for community leaders  who say the space is a symbol of a prideful and ascendant Mattapan that will nurture a new generation of leaders — and keep teens away from street crime “Mattapan has a new energy that it didn’t have before ” said Boston City Councilor Tim McCarthy  whose district includes parts of the neighborhood  “Pride is rising by leaps and bounds  This whole section of the city is really just turning around at a fast pace ”McCarthy and other officials said the new teen center and  recent improvements to Almont Park are helping to change the image of Mattapan as an overlooked corner of the city that struggles to land projects and funding “Mattapan is an outlier ” said Sheila Dillon  director of Boston’s Department of Neighborhood Development  “It’s physically removed from the center  of the city   so it’s really important that the city maintains centers  assets  and programs that are targeted for Mattapan residents ”In keeping with the Mattapan centric character of the teen center  the Boys   Girls Club said 65 percent of the people working on the project were residents of Mattapan  Dorchester  or Roxbury  and that the vast majority of subcontract jobs had gone to minority  or women owned businesses Standing on a rough plywood stage inside the building  Walsh directly addressed the teens in the room “There’s going to be space in here so that you can come in here and enjoy it as your space  because you are the leaders of tomorrow ” he said  “There’s going to be people at this microphone in a few years from now who are going to be the mayor of the City of Boston  and they’re going to be able to say they went through the Boys   Girls Club of Mattapan ”Mattapan’s upward trajectory is apparent even to the young Simplice twins  Vanessa recalled an incident 10 years ago  when she watched out her window as a man was shot on the sidewalk in front of the family’s home  Only 6 years old at the time  she remembers thinking the gunshots were fireworks  and watching through the glass as the man bled out and died despite the efforts of neighbors who ran outside to try to save him “But you don’t see that anymore ” Melissa interjected  “Now  all you hear about Mattapan is  they’re doing some community service  they’re building a garden  there’s more job opportunities where teens can work ”Neither girl is sure whether she will live here as an adult  but both say when they grow up they want to give back to Mattapan  And in the meantime  they will proudly defend their home to anyone who dares malign it “People call it ‘Murderpan’ because it used to be violent ” Melissa said  “But we’re like  ‘No

sell its main sanctuary to the highest bidder  along with the other properties it has agreed to sell The church’s lawyers rejected the notion as outrageous  and even the judge noted the request was contrary to the point of reorganizing under Chapter 11  nIt’s the debtor’s right  Judge Frank J  Bailey said  “to retain for its own use the core property that is fundamental to its mission ’’But the bank’s counsel  Douglas Gooding  said the two bids the church had received so far from nonprofits  for $2 million each  were not high enough  The church needs to hire a more aggressive broker  he said  and market the properties more widely  into June  The bank also wants the right to bid on the properties  using the debt it is owed “The marketing process has been woefully deficient ’’ Gooding told the judge The fight between two prominent black Boston institutions erupted more than two years ago  when OneUnited threatened to auction off the Roxbury church because Charles Street had fallen behind on another loan  OneUnited had loaned the church $3 3 million in 2006 to build a nearby community center  and Charles Street struggled to repay the loan during the financial crisis Now  the congregation has given up its dream of having a Roxbury Renaissance Center next door  Facing financial realities — and the judge’s rejection of their first reorganization plan last fall — the church has offered to sell the nearly completed center  an adjacent parking lot  and storefront space  as well as a house in Milton  nBut the bank continued to take a hard line  by casually raising the idea of Charles Street’s merging with another nearby African Methodist Episcopal church  or leasing back its own church space  n“That’s offensive ’’ said Charles Dale  a lawyer for the regional church of

partner of Ropes   Gray  serves as an honorary board member of Horizons  which is looking to house an early childhood center for 200 homeless children at the site  Another lawyer from the firm serves

nonprofit’s broker who had found the church’s community center space and suggested a bid The US bankruptcy trustee agreed that the bidders’ ties to Ropes require greater disclosure  He also defended the bank’s right to bid on the properties as a creditor  nRosner refuted the bank’s contention that the Roxbury properties could fetch far more money from a commercial buyer  “This property has really a not for profit  public mission use ’’ he said He also said allowing the bank to bid on the properties would be unfair to the other parties  because the bank would have an edge  Rosner said Horizons had been in talks to buy the space for a year and cannot wait for an extended sale process “We can’t continue to do this dance ’’ he said  “Timing is important ’’The judge indicated that with two

efforts to revitalize Roxbury  In addition to helping fill parcels that have been vacant for decades  the transportation building would bring thousands of office workers to the neighborhood  at a time when several developments would add dozens of retail stores  several hotels  and hundreds of homes to that section of Roxbury Governor Deval Patrick has been trying to finalize the deal in the waning days of his administration “The governor is committed to doing for Roxbury what the current transportation building did for downtown Boston ” spokeswoman Cyndi Roy Gonzalez said Wednesday  “It revitalized a neighborhood in desperate need of economic opportunity  The governor has trained his eyes on a community like Roxbury to do something similar ”A spokesman for Governor elect Charlie Baker said the incoming administration is aware of the proposal and generally supports the idea of moving state offices to support development in struggling parts of the city Several major projects are already moving forward in Roxbury  including construction of a science and engineering building for Northeastern University and relocation of the Boston School Department to a remodeled commercial complex at the heart of Dudley Square  Other major projects are planned along Melnea Cass Boulevard and at a former bus yard on Bartlett Street   nBut the Tremont Crossing project would bring the most sweeping change to the area in decades The development by Feldco Development Corp  and Elma Lewis Partners would revitalize 7 25 acres of parking lots and vacant land that is now a dead zone between the South End and Dudley Square MassDOT would occupy up to 800 000 square feet of office space in the project  which would also include a hotel  300 residences  offices  and 350 000 square feet of retail and restaurant space  It would probably take several years for the new transportation building to be constructed BJ’s Wholesale Club has committed to anchoring Tremont Crossing’s retail space with a 90 000 square foot store  The project would also include a museum for the National Center of Afro American Artists  two public plazas  and a 1 500 space parking garage The Tremont Crossing project has suffered fits and starts over the years  The developers were close to striking a deal to host a new regional headquarter with Partners HealthCare  but a year ago Partners opted to move to the Assembly Row development in Somerville Negotiations to bring MassDOT to the property have been going on for several months  A law signed by Patrick on Oct  31 signaled the state could be gearing up to sell its downtown property  The law calls for the transfer of ownership from the Division of Capital Asset Management and Maintenance to the Department of Transportation The transfer ensures that if the property is sold  the revenue would go to the cash strapped transportation agency  which would need the money to help pay for the new Roxbury headquarters   nAn item on the agenda for the BRA’s monthly board meeting proposes a land swap with the Transportation Department that would allow it to move to the Tremont Crossing location The agenda does not indicate what land the agency would get in exchange  BRA officials declined to comment When it was constructed in the early 1980s  the Transportation Building was meant to spur private investment at the edge of the old “Combat Zone ” which contained numerous drug infested bars and strip clubs Though the transformation did not happen immediately  the eight story red brick facility now sits at the center of a bustling neighborhood that includes hundreds of luxury condominiums  renovated theaters  and hundreds of new hotel rooms The city’s Assessing Department values the Transportation Building at $121 million  though it would probably sell for significantly more State transit agencies have the largest presence in the building  with some 1 600 MassDOT and MBTA employees working there  The facility also has office space for other state government workers  and Emerson rents a small amount of space in the complex', '2014_1195')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article',

party’s economic agenda for equal pay  affordable child care  and paid sick leave for women Pelosi’s bus tour  which included US Representative John F  Tierney and other members of the Massachusetts delegation  stopped at a Hyde Park industrial park where Pelosi was greeted by a warm  cheering crowd  After the event  the Democratic leader stressed that her visit to the Hub was about sending a strong message to Republicans about key bread and butter issues  rather than mere politics  n“We are hoping to go back to a place where it is a given       that women should be paid equally for equal work  that women should have a decent wage and shouldn’t have to raise their children in poverty  that we have paid sick leave  and that we have child care ’’ she said  “This is about the issues more than it is about politics  It’s about our country ”But Pelosi’s trip was also clearly geared toward boosting Tierney  a Salem Democrat fighting to hold his seat  with challenges coming from inside his own party and from the Republican who nearly unseated him in 2012 Just last week  the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee booked more than $1 4 million worth of television time this fall to help Tierney  In Hyde Park  Pelosi spoke glowingly of Tierney  saying the veteran congressman knows what is central to women’s work  including access to education Pelosi also helped headline an afternoon tea Monday at the InterContinental Hotel with Michelle Obama and US Representative Steve Israel  head of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee  which aims to wrest control of the House of Representatives from Republicans The committee said 200 people paid from $500 a person to $32 400 a couple to attend the tea  US Representative Katherine Clark  who introduced Obama  said Republicans have “consistently blocked every single attempt at making life better for American families ” nStanding in front of a blue curtain and six American flags  Obama noted that Democrats are 17 seats away from taking back the House and urged more people to vote in the midterm elections “We need to call them and remind them that the midterms are coming  and we need to give them a ride to the polls to make sure they get there ” the first lady said to loud applause Earlier in the day  shortly after noon  Pelosi arrived outside the offices of Roxbury Technology Corp  on a bus bearing the slogan “When Women Succeed  America Succeeds ” the theme for the Democratic economic agenda for women and families The bus carried 15 Democrats  most of them women  Championing an increase to the federal minimum wage  speakers said that 50 years after President John F  Kennedy signed the Equal Pay Act into law  women still earn less than men  Women make only 77 cents for every dollar earned by men  and for black and Latino women  the pay gap is even wider  Black women average 64 cents and Latinos earn 55 cents on average for every dollar earned by white  non Hispanic men  said US Representative Joseph P  Kennedy III  who spoke at the event “We have been trying to get reforms that will make these statistics a thing of the past ’’ Kennedy said  citing data from a study by his cousin  Maria Shriver  “We’ve been fighting from the day I got into office and long before       to raise the minimum wage and establish paycheck fairness ”During his speech  Tierney saved his punches for the current House leadership  saying that “the wrong team’’ is in power and that bills ensuring equal pay  paid sick leave  and affordable  good quality child care will not pass with Republicans in power “We have a situation here  and this is having the wrong team in charge ’’ Tierney said Ian Prior  spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee  shot back in an e mail  saying Pelosi and Tierney are peddling “phony statistics” and not focused on real solutions “Women should absolutely receive equal pay for equal work  and we need to find real solutions that can provide better opportunities while improving our economy ’’ Prior said Republican Richard Tisei  who is mounting another challenge after narrowly losing to Tierney in 2012  also took aim at the incumbent’s record on women  saying public records show he underpaid them “He says he’s for pay equality  but in his own Congressional office he’s only paying women 82 cents on the dollar compared to men  according to public records ’’ said Tisei’s spokesman  Charlie Szold  “It’s not surprising that today’s bus tour skipped the Sixth District  because people here have been missing his leadership for 17 years ”Loren Soltani  a spokeswoman for Tierney  said that two thirds of Tierney’s staff is made up of women and that their average salary and benefit packages were 2 percent more than their male counterparts Tierney is also facing a candidate in the Democratic primary  Marine veteran Seth Moulton', '2014_490')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article',

has placed three administrators at Boston Latin Academy on paid administrative leave  just two weeks before the new school year begins  as the department investigates allegations of harassment  discrimination  and intimidation School officials did not identify the individuals  but said they were program directors  who typically oversee academic departments and evaluate teachers  Other staff members will fill the roles temporarily  t nA “leadership coach” will be assigned to work with headmaster Emilia Pastor and the rest of the school team to resolve a variety of issues  according to a  Interim Superintendent John McDonough e mailed to staff Wednesday night  Copies are also being sent to parents “I view these efforts as collaborative and productive  not administrative or prescriptive ” McDonough wrote  “We share the same goal of ensuring that Boston Latin Academy continues to be a school that reflects  the Boston public schools  at our very best  We share your sense of urgency that requires us to make changes to position all students for success in a wide range of higher education opportunities ”Latin Academy  located on Townsend Street in Dorchester  is one of the city’s exam schools  where admission hinges on passing an entrance exam  The school  which currently has an enrollment of 1 700 students  originally opened in 1878 as an all girls college preparatory school and is often confused with the better known Boston Latin School  which initially taught only boys  Both schools went coeducational in the 1970s McDonough’s actions stem from concerns raised three months ago by dozens of Latin Academy teachers  who say the school’s administration was creating a hostile work environment and was forcing teachers to lower academic standards  through tactics such as mandating they award more As and Bs to students If teachers refused to comply or asked too many questions  they said  school administrators often targeted them for removal  stepping up classroom observations and writing nuanced evaluations that picked apart performance and offered little constructive feedback for improvement Adding further anxiety  teachers said  the administration appeared to be developing a pattern  whether intentional or not  of pushing out older teachers and black teachers  Staff outlined their concerns in a  to McDonough in May  which was later reported by the Globe Teachers reached for comment Thursday said they were relieved to return to school next month with certain administrators out of the building “We are pleased ” said one teacher  who asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the allegations  “There was tremendous trepidation and fear what happened last school year would continue this year  The term bloodbath was being thrown around ”The dispute flared after the school system rolled out a revamped evaluation system over the last two years that is intended to provide more constructive feedback to teachers  administrators  and other educators with an eye toward improvement But teachers at some schools across the city  as with those at Latin Academy  say adminstrators are using the evaluation in punitive ways and may also be discriminating against teachers of certain demographics  In fact  the first batch of districtwide data  released last year  showed that teachers across the system who are black  Hispanic  or older were more likely to receive a low rating  prompting school district officials to step up training At Latin Academy  school district officials met with dozens of staff members on the last day of school  fielding their concerns for about three hours  Representatives from the School Department’s Office of Academics  Office of Human Capital and Office of Equity  which handles discrimination complaints  then investigated throughout the summer McDonough said in his letter that “additional changes remain a possibility” at the school “We will monitor the situation closely in the months ahead ” McDonough wrote  “We are taking these steps so we can effectively address the concerns that have been raised by faculty  staff  and students  Our work is not yet finished ”McDonough declined an interview request through a spokesman “He tried to put everything he can say about the topic in the letter to be as open as possible about the actions we are taking while also respecting the confidentiality of the process ” the spokesman  Lee McGuire  said in an e mail  “For now he is going to limit his comments to what is in the public letter  so everyone has the same information ”Councilor Tito Jackson  who chairs the City Council’s Education Committee and has raised concerns about the situation at Boston Latin Academy  said he believes the School Department acted decisively “I believe the changes in administration are justified so Boston Latin Academy can move forward ” he said  “I’ve spoken to many teachers  as well as staff members  at Boston Latin Academy and I’m taken that every single person who I spoke with were squarely focused not on their own job but the future of the city of Boston and the preparation of the talented young people who go to BLA ”Teachers said they appreciated that school district officials took their concerns seriously “They really listened to us and were supportive ” said another teacher  “I do feel confident that they are going to help us make this school year a better one and we can just get back to teaching and learning ” n•  n', '2014_331')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no

library while it was being renovated and wondering how the “big  empty” space would ever become a meeting place for teens  Once the work was done  however  Williams said the new Mattapan Teen Center run by the Boys   Girls Clubs of Boston was better than anything she imagined  t n“The walls were vibrant and there were flashing lights and there was a beautiful kitchen and I walked in and I felt comfortable ” Williams said  “I felt like I just walked into my living room  I could just sit down and watch TV and enjoy life and be home  And I think I love that about this place ”Williams was among hundreds of teens  city officials  supporters  neighbors  and Boys   Girls Clubs staffers who gathered Saturday to celebrate the opening of the center on Hazleton Street  It offers a study space where homework can be done  a kitchen  a technology room  a music studio  and a performing arts area that can be used for fitness activities  The building has soaring ceilings accentuated by arched windows  columns  and a white and gold City of Boston seal  which hangs over the common room  The walls are painted bright shades of blue  orange  and rose The Richard and Susan Smith Family Foundation and Robert and Dana Smith each donated $2 5 million to the center  In total  the Boys   Girls Clubs of Boston raised $5 5 million to build  endow  and pay for five years of operating costs at the site  said Alexandra Fuchs  the organization’s executive vice president of development   “This is exactly what we need in Mattapan ” said Joyann Yarde  who lives near the center  “I think it is so open and so welcoming ”Her daughter  Aaliyah  16  who has been going to Yawkey Club of Roxbury  remembers the Mattapan building when it was a library “It was very dark and kind of gloomy ” Aaliyah Yarde said  “This place is very bright ”The building was used as a library from 1931 to 2009  when a new Mattapan branch opened on Blue Hill Avenue  The Boys   Girls Clubs of Boston then purchased the vacant building from the city The center opened two weeks ago for youths age 13 to 18 and is the first standalone facility for teenagers in the Boys   Girls Clubs of Boston system  Fuchs said About 125 teenagers are expected to attend programming there each evening and more than 250 teens are likely to use the center every year  according to the city  On Saturday  teens spent time recording beats on computers  practicing dance moves  and playing video games Boston Mayor Martin J  Walsh  who attended the opening  said the city is working to create more opportunities and economic development in Mattapan “This is an unbelievable way to start ” Walsh said  “This is a place where people come and learn         We need to continue to create great spaces ” Also at the celebration was Jay Ash  Chelsea’s city manager   who was recently tapped by Governor elect Charlie Baker to lead the state’s housing and economic development agency in the next administration “It’s been my experience that places like this where kids can come together to better their lives and enjoy everything that a facility like a Boys   Girls Club can produce makes neighborhoods stronger ” Ash said  “In making neighborhoods stronger  we make regions stronger  we make the entire state stronger ”Boston Police Commissioner William B  Evans said he was recently in Charlestown where people are mourning the

the youngest of her five children  lying on the sidewalk  Struck down on his way home from a basketball game  by a bullet meant for someone else  Odom’s faithful  sensitive  drum playing 13 year old was gone   t nAnd so she doesn’t remember what Tom Menino said to her when he stopped by in the days after her son was murdered in October of 2007  She recalls the mayor sitting in her living room  on a dining room chair somebody had brought in for him  talking with her husband and father in law  but that is all  “I remember thinking  ‘Wow  the mayor was here ’” she recalled  “I don’t think I really knew the depth of that ’’ The depth of Menino’s presence only came clear in the months and years that followed those first awful days  Because the mayor kept coming back  delivering on a promise he surely made in Kim Odom’s grief filled living room — to be there for them  to give them whatever they needed Most mayors would have visited the Odoms that October  when the whole city reeled from the death of a sweet boy just steps from his own front door  But Menino’s strength as a mayor and a man lay not in such big gestures at critical moments  important as they were  His greatness was in the follow through  in countless quiet acts of kindness and shows of support  offered long after most of the city had moved on  The mayor made the Odoms feel as if they belonged to him  and he to them Much more than the urban mechanic he was so often touted as  Tom Menino was a master of the heart  He took Steven’s death personally  This man  who wanted to control everything that happened in his city  was utterly powerless in the face of this senseless death  and it shook him  “I as mayor have the most responsibility ” he said  speaking at Steven’s funeral  at Morningstar Baptist Church  “But everyone in this room must take responsibility…Today is the day  the beginning  to say  enough is enough ”Kim Odom and her whole family were determined to make her son’s death count for something  to make his memory last  And Menino  though he had an entire city to run  always seemed poised to help them do it Kim was pained by the impromptu shrine that grew on the Dorchester sidewalk where Steven fell  Passing the teddy bears and notes and candles every day made her feel as if her son was still lying there “I was determined that his life did not end on that sidewalk ” she said  She wanted a memorial that spoke more to life than death  She wanted a tree  Menino ordered one  showing up on a rainy Spring day to see it planted  Year after year  he and his wife Angela returned to that tree to mark the anniversaries of Steven’s death  When Steven’s brother Brandon organized an annual basketball tournament in Steven’s memory  Menino was there to watch the games Sometimes Kim felt guilty  wondering if others had this direct a line to the mayor  Many did  of course  The man had met half the city personally  Still  she worried that her family might be getting more than their fair share of his attention  and she mentioned it one day  wondering if he should keep a lower profile with them “I don’t care who knows what I’m doing ” she recalled him telling her  They never talked about why he was so committed to her family  They did not have that kind of relationship  and the mayor was not much prone to such introspection  Kim learned early not to talk to him about Steven in ways that would make her cry  Menino seemed uncomfortable when she was too emotional  Looking back now  she is convinced that Menino was a blessing from God  a gift she should have embraced without hesitation  but sometimes couldn’t  The mayor wasn’t put off at all by her hesitation  he barreled right through it   When she did not go to him for help  Menino went to her  She remembers being at the airport in Washington with her husband Ronald  arriving for a violence prevention event  when his phone rang  It was the mayor  wondering what they were planning for that year’s memorial  “What is it you need ” He called them out of the blue sometimes  to offer congregants at the Odoms’ True Vine Church tickets to the Big Apple Circus  Or to make sure they had turkeys to give away at Thanksgiving  This man with six hundred thousand constituents was chasing them down  trying to give them things  In 2011  the mayor got wind that Brandon had graduated from UNH and the family had had a block party to celebrate  He buttonholed Brandon’s brother Tyrone  a DPW worker who happened to be in City Hall one day  The mayor said he was hurt he hadn’t been invited  When Ron’s mother died in 2012  Menino showed up  unannounced  at State Temple church of God in Christ on Fessenden Street  for the wake  Nobody had asked him to be there  “I think you don’t realize how much those things mean to you until you add them all up ” Kim said  crying  She worries that she did not thank Menino properly for all he did for her family  that she didn’t reach out to him after he fell ill  the way he had reached out to the Odoms  But being able to help her family was Menino’s reward  He loved gratitude  but he lived to make things happen for people  Especially for families like the Odoms  whose loss was on his mind even in his last days in office “I did my job ” he told the Globe  just before he left City Hall  ticking off the tragedies to which he’d borne witness  “It goes on and on and on  Odoms  All those folks  But I just did what I was supposed to do  Not to be melodramatic  but if you’re mayor  you should be there ”Tom Menino was there  He was always there

was shot and killed in his family’s Mattapan apartment by his 14 year old brother Friday morning  anguishing neighbors and prompting a plea from the city’s mayor for residents to surrender unwanted guns Just before noon on a school day  the older brother was playing with a gun when it fired  striking the younger boy in the chest  police said  The boy was rushed to Boston Medical Center  where he was pronounced dead  nThe older boy left his Morton Street home  but was apprehended nearby still carrying the weapon police said was used to shoot his brother “He was very remorseful for what he did ” William Evans  the city’s police commissioner  said at the scene  adding that the boy appeared to have panicked  “I think he realized the gravity of what he had done ” nThe victim is the youngest person killed in the city since 2010  when 2 year old Amanihotep Smith was shot in his mother’s arms after a home invasion in Mattapan The mother of the boys was not home at the time of the shooting  Evans said  It was not clear why they were not at school  The younger boy  found by police lying on his back in the hallway of his home  was in the fourth grade at James W  Hennigan Elementary School in Jamaica Plain  The school notified parents of the shooting in a voice mail and counselors were on hand for students Authorities charged the 14 year old with unlawful gun possession and involuntary manslaughter  saying that he was handling the gun recklessly when it fired There was no evidence that anyone else in the home knew he had the gun  they said Authorities were quick to call the shooting an apparent accident  but homicide detectives continued their investigation Friday   Last June  police responded to the same address for a domestic violence report in which the 14 year old allegedly slapped his younger brother in the face and threw him to the ground  His older teenage sister told police that he then pushed his mother to the ground and threatened to kill her In a police report on that visit  the sister stated the brother had “been very aggressive toward the family lately and that this was not the first time the police were called to their residence ”The mother also told police that it was “not the first time” she had problems with her 14 year old  according to the report  The older brother was charged with assault in the June incident Neighbors and police also said that officers had been previously called to the three decker on Morton Street because of loud parties and  in one case  a shooting A law enforcement official briefed on Friday’s shooting  said that “everything we are looking at it indicates it was accidental ”“The brother was playing with the gun  pulled the magazine  and there was one bullet in the chamber ” said the official  who spoke on the condition his name not be published Authorities were attempting to determine how the brother acquired the gun and whether he knew a bullet was in the chamber The name of the older boy was withheld by authorities because of his age  Investigators also did not release the name of the victim Evans said he arrived at the home just as emergency responders were rushing the younger child to an ambulance “To see a young boy  curly hair  with so much life to live ’’ Evans said  his voice wavering with emotion  “Having three children myself  it just breaks your heart ”Evans said the boys’ mother was “extremely distraught ”In a prepared statement Friday  the Department of Children and Families  the state’s child welfare agency  declined to say whether it had any involvement with the family At the scene  Mayor Martin J  Walsh called the death a tragedy and urged residents to turn in guns to police “A 14 year old should not have access to a gun ” he said  “There are far too many guns in our streets ”“I’m calling for the community to step up to the plate and report these guns  Parents  siblings — we need to get these guns off the street ” he added Daniel Conley  the Suffolk district attorney  said investigators would work to determine how the boy acquired the weapon “In the meantime  I want to make something crystal clear  If you know about an illegal firearm in this city  help us prevent another tragedy like this one ” he said The 14 year old was scheduled to be arraigned Monday in a closed hearing in juvenile court US Attorney Carmen M  Ortiz also said members of the community need to do more to track down guns in their homes and turn them over to police “You have to get the message out into the community that we share a sense of responsibility ” she said “The solution is not just law enforcement  The community has to be involved  do what they can  and cooperate with police ”State Representative Gloria Fox  who represents Roxbury  visited the home with a grief counselor  saying the tragedy underscores the need for stricter gun control measures “I don’t know where that gun came from  but it should not have been in that young boy’s hands ’’ she said  “We’ve got to stop the trafficking of guns into our neighborhoods ”In a neighborhood long plagued by gun violence  the death of a boy so young touched off a wave of grief and anger “Why would someone so young have a gun ” said Debra Brown  54  “Why weren’t they in school  Where were the parents  It shouldn’t have to be this way ”On Morton Street  residents decried the easy availability of guns  even for young teenagers  and the fear that pushes them to buy weapons “The sad thing is it’s so easy to get a gun in Boston ” said Nelson Martinez  43  “He probably didn’t have to look very hard ’’Cosandra Harrigan  44  said there have been numerous shootings in the neighborhood in recent years  including one last summer in front of the same Morton Street home “Last summer they had a wild party  and somebody got shot in front of the same house  too  and died ’’ said Harrigan  “I’ve been here 17 years  and I’ve witnessed a lot of shootings ’’“That’s the second shooting that has happened here ’’ said Ebony Rhodes  20  of Dorchester  That’s crazy  It’s shocking ”The shooting recalled for some the 2007 death of Liquarry Jefferson Jr   a first grader who was shot to death by his 7 year old cousin while they were playing with a gun left inside their apartment by a relative Jefferson was 8 when he was shot on June 24 of that year  He and his cousin had found a loaded 9mm handgun in the dresser drawer of Jayquan McConnico  an older cousin Despite the cold weather Friday  neighbors gathered near the home where the shooting occurred  saying they were struggling to come to grips with what had happened Celia Gabadon  72  said that police are doing what they can and that change has to come from the community “Police are doing a good job ” she said  “We are to blame ”',

we’re starting to see some real competition T Mobile has broken the mold by letting customers pay for smartphones in monthly installments  in addition to choosing their own voice and data plans  With an old school contract  you keep paying the same price  year after year  With T Mobile  your monthly payments decrease as soon as the phone’s paid for Perhaps the best bargain around comes from T Mobile and retailer   They’re selling unlimited texting and data  and 100 minutes of talk time  for just $30 a month  For those of us who mainly use our phones for e mail and Web searching  it’s an exceptional bargain Other carriers are responding to T Mobile’s aggressive moves    for instance  recently announced that customers will get a $15 monthly rate cut if they pay full price for the phone

Internet video streamer  plans to offer its popular show “House of Cards” in 4K this year  and Sony is releasing a lot of Blu ray movies in 4K  But it will probably take a while to build up a large

we fall ’’ they said  “We’re here today ’’They were not even members of the church where they had come to pray  But word was everywhere that the historic Charles Street African Methodist Episcopal Church was in trouble  They came to plead for its salvation  t nThat day in March  lawyers had filed bankruptcy papers for one of Boston’s oldest and most influential African American churches after a storm of financial trouble that has shocked and angered many in the pews and in the community it serves The church  though battered  is expected to survive with the help of protection from bankruptcy court  But church leaders are facing questions about how an institution with roots in the antislavery movement and a rock of stability in Boston’s black community for nearly 200 years wound up so deeply in crisis “How did we get here  That question has been asked many times ’’ said Curtis Wells  a longtime church member who regularly advises the pastor  “We’ve been in conversations about the finances of the church for a while now ’’At the heart of the trouble is the Rev  Gregory Groover’s vision of an ambitious $4 million Roxbury community center  a focal point of rejuvenation in Grove Hall  a neighborhood that badly needed it  He had imagined a sparkling facility that would be an extension of the church’s mission   where couples could celebrate their marriages in a ballroom  young people could study and record music  and fledgling businesses could get a start  To realize his dream  Groover’s church borrowed heavily  counting on future fundraising proceeds and fees the center would charge for wedding receptions and meeting space to repay loans  t nIn the end  those plans were overtaken by unexpected construction delays  a catastrophic economic collapse and a lender that turned out to have serious problems of its own Many blame that lender  the prominent black owned OneUnited Bank in Boston  for the church’s financial mess  The bank had eagerly sought the church’s business  they say  But later  under financial duress and scrutiny from regulators  it backed away from the relationship  demanding full payment when the loan came due   rather than permitting  refinancing   and moving to foreclose  Others in the church  though  wonder whether Groover and Charles Street AME had been reckless in their zeal for the community center plan   borrowing more than the church could realistically afford and taking on project that neither Groover nor those advising him were qualified to run  “There is a heavy sense of responsibility that I shoulder for where things went sour ’’ said Groover  “For all the miscalculation  for the wrong steps  I take the blame  and I take the full responsibility  Every day I toss and turn  feeling like I let my congregation down ’’ Charles Street AME   founded in 1818 by freed slaves and revered by generations of blacks in Boston  both for its deep historical roots and its work on behalf of the poor and in promoting educational opportunities   has long prided itself on its financial stability  The congregation has made a point of giving to the church  particularly in times of need  On the wall in the church’s foyer are two framed fading sheets of paper listing the names of 120 African Americans who had paid off the church’s mortgage 69 years ago  At the top of each sheet of paper  in bold block letters  are the words  “Debt Free in 1943 ’’ nGroover was a young minister from a small congregation in Freeport  N Y   on Long Island when he was appointed to the Charles Street AME pulpit in June 1994  The church was relatively prosperous at the time  It owned an old parsonage around the corner from the church that was turned into administrative offices and another house in Milton the church had bought for a previous pastor  In 1999  Charles Street AME took a small leap  borrowing to purchase the old Sky Cap lounge  a former Jewish meeting hall that had later become a function hall and weekend nightclub for African Americans who had begun to settle near Warren Street  Groover saw promise in the old building  both for the church and to help improve the neighborhood  About the same time  the church acquired retail space with paying tenants located between the church and the Sky Cap building  with hopes of one day converting the space for church purposes Taking out loans to make the purchases  the church had about $1 1 million in debt by 2001  It comfortably managed the payments and soon began slowly raising money with plans to renovate the Sky Cap building and convert it to the Roxbury Renaissance Center of Groover’s vision   nFive years later  in the fall of 2006  along came what seemed like a lucky break  OneUnited Bank’s president  Kevin Cohee  eager to make a mark in Grove Hall  approached Charles Street with an offer to help build the center  church officials say  OneUnited was willing to finance a $3 7 million construction loan  and also wanted to take over the church’s existing $1 1 million debt  Cohee wanted the deal badly enough to waive an $800 000 down payment  according to court documents  The deal was struck and celebrated as a union of two black institutions  working together to transform a neighborhood  The following year  OneUnited would open a new bank branch near the church and stage an exuberant press conference with the mayor and hold a party at the church Groover and the center’s project manager had a plan to tackle the growing debt  He launched a “vision to victory’’ campaign to raise $2 million  The church would also target large donors outside the church who support the church’s mission and legacy   nBut the Renaissance Center project soon went off track  Builders discovered contaminated soil on the site  putting off construction for more than a year  By the time work on the building finally got underway late in 2007  one of the loans   structured as a balloon whose principle would come due all at once  in June 2008   was fast coming due  nThe balloon loan had enabled the church to get a low interest rate  and church leaders had counted on simply getting a new loan  if necessary  when the big payment came due  Through 2009  the church asked for  and received  five extensions on the loan as it tried to complete construction But in that time  Wall Street had imploded  a financial calamity that would gut $50 million from OneUnited’s investments in the troubled mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac  The bank sought help from the US Treasury and would later receive a $12 million federal bailout  The bank also came under pressure from regulators for poor loan management and excessive executive pay So when the church went back for a sixth extension  with the project nearly finished  the bank turned it down and refused to refinance  It also halted payments to the builder   Thomas Construction Co   a black owned firm in Roxbury   that is owed $629 000  nMeanwhile  Charles Street’s liabilities were rapidly piling up  Fees for the loan extensions and penalties for late loan payments added up to hundreds of thousands of dollars  And to replace the church’s old and badly leaking roof  it borrowed another $450 000 from Tremont Credit Union  The relationship between the bank and church became increasingly bitter  and in the summer of 2010  Groover asked a group of investors to try and renegotiate the loan  A proposal to pay it off for about 30 cents on the dollar was quickly rejected  and the bank sued for full payment  The church counter sued  alleging the bank had made the loan “without adhering to prudent lending standards   for the ultimate purpose of gaining publicity and notoriety  and expanding its business in the church’s neighborhood ’’ The bank would later say that charge was unfair and that it met several times with church officials to work out problems  The bank’s lawyer said during bankruptcy proceedings last month that  1 8  felt “blind sided’’ and “taken aback’’ by the church’s low offer and that the bank had been more than fair to the church Bank officials declined to speak for this article  and issued a statement saying the bank is “flexible in our efforts to assist borrowers in a manner consistent with the safe and sound banking practices ’’As the ugly court battle generated publicity about a project whose future suddenly was in doubt   church donors held back  wary of the litigation and hurt by the limping economy  Groover’s “vision to victory’’ campaign withered  n“It cut church giving and dried up charitable donations ’’ said Fred Dashiell  a real estate lawyer and church member   nThe bank moved to foreclose and auction the church   news that Groover learned on Valentine’s Day from a panicked church member who had seen a notice online  n“I cried and I prayed ’’ Groover said  “I don’t think I slept that night  I don’t think I’ve slept well since then ’’“I was shocked to see it in the paper ’’ said Christina Banion  a chaplain at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and a Charles Street church member  “It’s sad that this was the pastor’s vision  When you are connected to someone who had a dream that seems to falter  it hurts ’’Church members joined prayer lines  vowing to find a way to pay off the debt and keep their building  Now  as the church struggles forward  some community leaders say frustration has mounted within the church that Groover bit off more than he could chew and that too few challenged him on the huge debt  “There is now a widespread perception that Rev  Groover  though completely well intentioned  was beyond his competence to effectively manage this project ’’ said a community leader who speaks regularly with church members and asked not to be identified for fear of alienating church leaders Church member Wells said that even before the church embarked on the project voices of caution in the congregation went unheeded “There were people saying ‘We can’t do this  We can’t afford this ’ ’’ Wells said  “But they were crying in the wilderness ’’They had faith in their pastor  he and others said  and faith in the venerable church’s ability to pull through  “We were Charles Street  One thing Charles Street has is a robust membership  and it has created new ministries and found ways to finance those ministries ’’ said Willie Jones  another longtime church member   nNow

east and about two hours north of Bar Harbor — Roosevelt Campobello International Park is free for visitors  “It takes so much effort to get here  we won’t charge you to get in ” quips park spokesperson Vern McKimmey  Equally funded by the United States and Canada  Roosevelt Campobello is in New Brunswick province  the only international park located solely on Canadian soil  This park is off the beaten path even for Canadians  For seven months of the year  until the summer ferries are running  the only way Canadians can get onto Campobello is by entering the United States and crossing the bridge from Lubec  Maine  In other words  to get from Canada to Canada means a quick trip into and out of the United States — passport required  So why would you go to the trouble  Surrounded by the chilly waters and legendary tides of the Bay of Fundy  Campobello Island would be just another pleasant fishing village — more familiar to grazing whales than tourists — but for one thing  Roosevelt Campobello International Park  This 2 800 acre property draws visitors for tours of Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s lovely memento filled family cottage  a new restaurant  and hiking trails that lead to rocky coves  ponds  and a fog shrouded forest  Founded by a treaty between the United States and Canada in 1964  Roosevelt Campobello Park is a symbol of friendship between the two countries  It turns 50 this month  with special events to mark the occasion and  we’re guessing  cake  t nAnd the park has another reason to celebrate  a seven part PBS documentary series by acclaimed filmmaker Ken Burns  “The Roosevelts  An Intimate History ” set to premiere on Sept  14  In 2 hour long segments it highlights the lives of Theodore  Franklin  and Eleanor Roosevelt  members of one of the most influential families in US politics  It’s  nan important production for PBS  and a big deal for Roosevelt Campobello International Park  Burns and his crew filmed here three years ago  and island residents  many of whom work at the park  can’t wait to see the results  Some eager viewers won’t have to wait that long  since preview events will be held in St  Andrews by the Sea  New Brunswick  and Bangor and Portland  Maine  Renewed interest in the Roosevelts — plus lovely shots of piney islets and deep blue bays — should mean more visitors to Roosevelt Campobello park  “We expect a bump in visitation ” McKimmey says  noting that Roosevelt related sites such as Hyde Park  N Y   and Warm Springs  Ga   are likely to draw more guests too  Even now  visitation is up 47 percent since 2009  with an estimated 130 000 visitors coming from the United States and Canada  A four year old program called “Tea with Eleanor” has been wildly popular  and the park has opened some of its historic cottages to host educational conferences  Although it has been decades since Franklin  1882 1945 and Eleanor  1884 1962  lived  interest in the Roosevelt family remains strong  And Roosevelts still visit the island  Since 1883  there’s hardly been a summer without a Roosevelt on the property  and two of the Roosevelts’ grandchildren are on the Park Commission  “On this little island  we loved the Roosevelts  and they changed us ” says ninth generation islander Theresa Mitchell  a guide at the park  A visit to Roosevelt Campobello Park brings this remarkable couple to life — and it also reveals why this quiet little island  far from the intrigue of Washington  D C   was so cherished by the country’s original power couple  nAs a child  Franklin Roosevelt enjoyed idyllic summers on Campobello Island  sailing and fishing with so much enthusiasm that a family friend labeled him a “sardine sized seaman ” As an adult  he often retreated to his “beloved island” home with Eleanor and their six children to relax and enjoy the outdoors  The family spent summers at the family cottage from 1909 until 1921  when Franklin was stricken with polio  He left Campobello on a stretcher  Eleanor  too  loved Campobello  and continued to visit her entire life  She was on hand for the opening of the FDR Memorial Bridge between Lubec and Campobello in 1962 Open for tours  the Roosevelts’ Arts and Crafts style shingled home  circa 1897  has 34 rooms and seven fireplaces  and all but five pieces of furniture are original  With a pile of blocks on the floor  and a Wedgewood tea set in the living room  the house looks like the occupants just stepped away for a few minutes — an ambience that worked well for the PBS film crew  McKimmey says  n t nEleanor liked her tea at 3 p m   “and you never knew how many people to plan for  since  she  would invite everyone she met  including local school girls  to attend ” guide Mitchell explains  And so the tradition continues  Tea and cookies are served in Hubbard Cottage  featuring recipes used by the Roosevelts’ cooks  Eleanor was no baker  they say   and available to guests in a booklet compiled by granddaughter Chandler Roosevelt Lindsley  Tea is free on a first come  first served basis  or $12 if you reserve in advance  which guarantees admittance  During teatime  park guides share stories about how Roosevelt transformed the role of first lady from hostess to activist  working for women’s rights  children’s rights  and civil rights  “By the time of her death  Eleanor was considered to be the first lady of the world ” Mitchell says   nTo get a feel for why the Roosevelts  and other wealthy families  loved this island  spend some time wandering the park’s 10 miles of hiking trails  A short   8 mile  walk to Friar’s Head leads to pretty views of the bay and cove  along the beach  depending on the tide   and a stacked rock that rises from the beach  Hike to an observation deck above Friar’s Head for scenic overlooks  The park offers bog walks and beach walks in season  ask at the visitors center  or pick up a trail map If you’re keen on lighthouses  you’re in luck  Campobello offers two that are worth a visit  Mulholland Point Light  on the south side of the island near the park with a small marine museum  and Head Harbour Lightstation to the north  a great spot for whale watching if you bring binoculars   Look for “Godzilla ” a minke whale known for breeching   Two local outfitters run whale watch excursions  and you’ll probably see seals and eagles if you drive around the island  Have dinner at the park’s new Fireside Restaurant  where a stone fireplace and log walls create a wonderful atmosphere  and the food is terrific  and other details   Since you can’t stay at the park unless you’re part of a conference  where do you sleep  The best choice on Campobello is Owen House Country Inn   Gallery  11 Welshpool St   Welshpool  506 752 2977    from $115 Canadian with private bath  including breakfast   a large Colonial built in 1835 featuring watercolor paintings by innkeeper artist Joyce Morrell On the Maine side  just a quick drive over the bridge  is Lubec  the easternmost town in the United States  Lubec has a couple of restaurants  all the lobster you can handle  and an interesting place to spend the night  the Inn on the Wharf  69 Johnson St   207 733

student voices are heard during the search for a new school superintendent  But when Mayor Martin J  Walsh and the School Committee named a 12 member search committee last month  not a single student was appointed Instead  they packed the panel with academics  current and former school administrators  teachers  parents  and a business executive  nThe move disappointed the Boston Student Advisory Council  a citywide organization of elected student leaders  which lobbied the mayor and the School Committee for representation and crafted its own criteria for a new superintendent  based on student surveys “Honestly  it didn’t make sense to us ” said Marcus Wade  an advisory council member and a junior at Dorchester Academy  “The superintendent makes decisions about students  and no one knows student needs better than students ” nThe students are hoping Walsh and the School Committee will change their minds But Michael O’Neill  the School Committee chairman  said there are not enough seats on the search panel to accommodate a student appointment  He said he and the mayor initially wanted to limit the panel’s size to nine members  but expanded it to 12 because of high interest among various parties across the city “There was a whole range of groups that volunteered to be part of the process  and we were trying to make sure we had a wide range of people who know the district and could hold the district accountable ” O’Neill said But he added  “You lose the ability to have an effective committee if it gets too big ”O’Neill said there will be other ways for students to participate  He noted they asked the Student Advisory Council to host a public forum this month on the search and offered the group an opportunity to interview the finalists “There are a variety of ways student voices can be heard ” he said  “I believe when we get to the end of the process here we will see student voice is both heard and respected ”Walsh  in a statement  offered no explanation as to why no student was appointed to the search committee  which will be looking for a permanent replacement for Carol R  Johnson  who retired last summer “The search committee is a large  diverse group of individuals  and is only one piece of a very active and community engaged process ” Walsh said  “We are confident that the voices of all stakeholders  students included  will be heard and incorporated into the selection of a superintendent for Boston public schools ”Across the state  students are rarely appointed to superintendent search panels  Glenn Koocher  executive director of the Massachusetts Association of School Committees  which conducts superintendent searches  could recall only two districts in recent years that included students on their panels “It’s truly a local call ” Koocher said Lyle Kirtman  chief executive of Future Management Systems  a Beverly based firm that conducts superintendent searches  said the lack of students on search panels needs to change “It’s an old model ” Kirtman said  “We should be using students more          They have a different point of view ”Even high profile boards  like school committees  include student representatives  But in Boston’s case  the student representative has no voting power  a situation students are pushing to change Barbara Fields  of the Black Educators Alliance of Massachusetts and a former Boston school administrator  pointed out that Boston high school students frequently serve on selection panels for headmasters “If students were deemed worthy to participate in the selection of a principal or headmaster  it’s not far fetched for them to be involved in the selection of a superintendent ” Fields said  “The constituency most directly impacted  by a new superintendent  are the students ”While Boston students say they appreciate the opportunities to host the forum and interview the finalists  they wonder whether the slate might look different if students had a voice on the search committee The Student Advisory Council is pushing for a superintendent who will communicate regularly and directly with students  visit schools frequently  and support student participation in decisions at their schools about their education The group says it also wants a superintendent who understands the diverse backgrounds of students  will fight for equitable funding  prioritize social and emotional support services  promote alternative education  and create partnerships for after school programs  jobs  and internships “We know what we want ” said Fajir Forbes Harris  a Student Advisory Council member and a 1oth grader at Edward M  Kennedy Academy for Health Careers  “We are in the classroom every day  We are the ones doing the work  It’s our education ”O’Neill said the search committee will

attendees began hurling bottles and other objects  hitting at least one person on the head and causing a laceration that led police to move in  Duffy said Officers were “clearly outnumbered”

policy in Boston  The proposed development is precisely what the city needs right now — reasonably priced  two bedroom apartments where residents can fall out of bed  jump on the T  and be downtown in about 20 minutes without adding to the city’s traffic congestion  In the parlance of urban planning  this is a golden example of “transit oriented development ”The Walsh administration has made a lot of noise about the need for the creation of new housing that falls between the city’s luxury towers and low income housing projects  Two nonprofit housing developers — Southwest Boston Community Development Corporation and Codman Square Neighborhood Development Corporation — have stepped up with a plan to build a $10 million apartment building targeted to working families earning about $45 000 per year  Mayor Walsh and his staff should be boosting this project  But City Hall has been eerily quiet  And Timothy McCarthy  the district councilor from Hyde Park  is cool to the idea  at best  People who make unconvincing arguments are usually good at listing lots of them  That was the case Tuesday night at a public hearing where several Hyde Park residents spoke out against the project  One woman described the architect’s rendering of the four story apartment building as “really unattractive and very much out of character ” OK  it’s not the Winter Palace in St  Petersburg  But the drawing depicts a pleasant  modern building with clean lines  And “out of character” should be taken as a compliment  The new development would be built on the current site of a couple of rundown industrial properties Another critic said he was “shocked and outraged” that the developers would build housing for families on a site near a polluted section of the Neponset River and within a few hundred yards of a former chemical plant  The developers said their environmental engineers have checked it out and don’t anticipate any unusual clean up hurdles  And nothing gets built  they stressed  without safety permits from state environmental agencies  Still  the critics successfully raised the specter of a building full of asthmatic kids and wheezing pets Neighborhood meetings are an intrinsic part of the development process in Boston for any project of more than 50 000 square feet  Too often  however  they become blocking mechanisms for NIMBY minded residents who can argue floor area ratios and zoning variances with the city’s best land use attorneys  That’s fine when neighbors have legitimate gripes about the size and location of a development project  It’s not fine  however  when neighbors raise lame objections to desperately needed housing  One critic of the Hyde Park development predicted the arrival of a “bad sort” who might turn the affordable apartment house into a crummy public housing project  A few decades ago  that would have been code for keeping minority families out of the neighborhood  But the majority of people living in the Hyde Park neighborhood are people of color  and the speaker in this case was a black man  He might have had a point if the developers were proposing apartments solely for destitute people  But only three of the units would be set aside for the homeless or tenants with very low incomes  This is a middle income development by design  with rents in the $1 300 $1 500 vicinity Supporters of the project also came out in force  Some spoke of the development’s potential to spur improvements to the nearby business districts in Logan and Cleary squares  Others hoped it would attract more private housing development to the area  They were excited by the potential for change  But City Councilor McCarthy  who enjoys a close relationship with Mayor Walsh  didn’t share that view “I think Hyde Park is pretty solid right now ” he said Housing experts anticipate the need for 30 000 new residences in Boston by 2020  Underdeveloped areas along the Fairmount commuter rail line in Dorchester and Mattapan  as well as Hyde Park  are ideal sites for new apartments  Peevish protests are sure to arise in those neighborhoods  too  Walsh should set the standard by indicating his support for the Fairmount development when it seeks approval next month at the Boston Redevelopment Authority Walsh certainly doesn’t need the political aggravation that might come from alienating a friendly district councilor along with residents in a high voting area of the city  But his needs aren’t the issue  What the city needs is reasonably priced housing along its transit lines', '2014_381')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article',

famous Roxbury russet apple still prized for taste and disease resistance Today  with the fresh emphasis on local food and sustainability  experts say they are seeing a renewed interest in planting backyard orchards  For an investment of about $400 for a 10 tree orchard and a little time  urban and suburban dwellers can discover the joys of growing their own fruit — even in small backyards   nPamela Thompson  head of programs at the Arnold Arboretum in Jamaica Plain  says the trend is being fueled by the emergence of new dwarf varieties of apples and the notion that compact orchards not only produce fruit but can also provide a layer of privacy between homes in denser neighborhoods “People in the city and suburbs are thinking more about where their food comes from and are trying their hands at gardening of all sorts ’’ Thompson says  “People are demanding a food system that is healthier  more accessible  equitable  and less wasteful  Urban orchards are one step toward community grown produce that can be shared with all ’’“Having grown up in Minnesota farming country  I need to be close to the land ” says gardener Steven Gag  gazing out over his well manicured backyard in Roslindale  Four years ago  in a few hours  he and a neighbor planted an apple orchard of 10 trees about 20 feet long  His mini orchard is bearing fruit — typically apple trees will be ready for picking after just a couple of years  Gag’s backyard also includes a chicken coop with white hens strutting around  a woodpile  and lovely beds of perennials  Sixteen solar panels line the roof and Gag  a fit  retired nonprofit executive who heads up Roslindale Village Main Street  says the array generates enough energy that he and his wife are able to sell some of it back to their utility  NStar  nThe Arnold Arboretum  in conjunction with the 22 5 acre Wakefield Estate in Milton  sponsors an annual single day workshop in planting dwarf orchards  as does UMass Extension   Mark Smith  executive director of the Wakefield Charitable Trust  says that the first Wakefield Estate session in 2010 drew just “a couple of people ’’ but there were about 30 in attendance at this year’s event in March   n nSite selection and preparation  Smith explains  requires picking a spot with full sun or as much as possible and well drained soil  Minimum preparation to the land includes removing weeds  loosening soil in the planting trench  and adding lime  The best time for planting is usually from early spring  after the ground has thawed  through the end of May    nRootstock can be purchased by mail order or a nursery that specializes in dwarf fruit trees  Good dwarf varieties of apples  Smith says  include Liberty  Goldrush  Galarina  Crimson Gala  and Topaz  Even four to 10 small trees can  within a few years  produce a bumper crop of fruit While it’s possible to plant other varieties of dwarf fruit trees  like pears  peaches  or plums  Smith says  the majority of people here seem most interested in apples    Smith once headed up Farm Aid in Somerville  The national nonprofit  which has since moved its office to Cambridge  advocates local and family farming and sustainable agriculture  It was founded by singers Willie Nelson  Neil Young  and John Mellencamp in the mid 1980s  Along with Judy Lieberman  Smith also established in 2006 the Brookwood Community Farm  a working organic farm and education center in Milton and Canton  In 2009  as director of the Wakefield Estate  which has been preserved as a learning and educational nonprofit arboretum adjacent to the Blue Hills  he installed a compact orchard of 45 trees — each three feet apart  “The first year  we picked off all the blossoms to return energy to the trees ” Smith explains — a standard practice for new orchards  He added that the second year  gardeners are advised to pick all the blossoms except for 15 to 20 per tree  again to return energy to the tree for further growth  By the third year  30 to 40 blossoms are left to fruit and by the fifth year  the small trees are producing “about 100 apples each ”Although standard apple trees can reach the height of 40 feet  dwarf varieties created for the backyard urban or suburban gardener only reach a quarter of that size   n“We’ve had great luck with the Liberty apple ” Smith notes  He also advises would be orchard growers to add a little fertilizer each year and to water their fruit trees with a soaker hose or drip irrigation  “If possible  plant your urban orchard on a north to south line and make sure you have five good hours of sunlight each day ” he says Pruning correctly and dealing with pests are of utmost importance in the first two or three years after planting apple trees  Smith says any branches that thicken to more than 50 percent of the diameter of the trunk should be pruned each spring  “Pruning my apple trees takes me 15 minutes a year ” notes Gag Deer and winter moths are quite common in Greater Boston and are menaces for dwarf backyard orchards  On the Wakefield Estate  which is in the Blue Hills  Smith and his staff installed a high deer fence  which in some suburban areas may or may not be necessary  As for winter moths  which “love to eat the blossoms ” Smith encourages planters to use Bacillus thuringiensis  or Bt  as a remedy as soon as worms appear  It’s a pesticide made from bacteria  as opposed to chemicals  and is allowed in certified organic agriculture  He counsels keeping Bt use to a minimum and only when necessary  nStaying organic is important to Gag  whose orchard includes gold and red Gala apples  which were ordered by mail as bareroot stock from Adams County Nursery in Pennsylvania  The small plants arrived dormant  He says he planted the orchard in 2010 in three hours — preparing the soil  digging holes for two fence posts  and stringing wire  which is necessary at first to support the trees  branches  and apples as they grow  Smith says he knows some urban gardeners plant small orchards not only for the apples but also to block their view of apartment houses and three deckers  The plantings are referred to as “fruiting walls ’’  nUrban orchards on public property have also become of interest in Boston in recent years  according to the Arnold Arboretum’s Thompson  A now defunct nonprofit called Earthworks started planting fruit trees in public places in the early 1990s  Earthworks planted in a number of places in the city and closely managed about a dozen sites from the South End to Mattapan at locations such as public schools  the Shirley Eustis House  and Edward Everett Square According to Vidya Tikku  interim director of nonprofit Boston Natural Areas Network  her group and the Dorchester Historical Society’s Clapp Farm have also planted some fruit trees within the past five years  Another organization  The Boston Tree Party  launched a campaign in 2011 through which 78 community groups each have planted and tend a pair of apple trees across 58 civic spaces such as schools  churches  and community gardens in Greater Boston  with an aim of finding ways to share the harvest    Tikku estimates that there were around 40 public orchards in the city  Right now  she says  there’s no official oversight over many of those trees  a number are poorly maintained and there are no rules about who can take the food and how much of it  But her group plans to work with the city’s food initiatives office with the goal of ensuring that there will be publicly accessible fruit and nut trees   For most of the groups and individuals involved in compact orchards the issue of locally grown food looms large   “In the early 1980s ” Smith explains  “New England orchards were being threatened first by industrial orchards in Washington state and the Pacific Northwest  Now most of our apples come from even farther away — from New Zealand and China  “Why not grow and buy our apples in Dorchester and Southie  in Roslindale and Hyde Park  in Milton and Lincoln and Lynn ” As for Gag  standing one sunny morning recently in his Boston backyard orchard surveying his apple trees about to burst into blossom  “This year I’m perfecting my apple pies  Have you ever tasted crust made with orange juice  It’s delicious ” n', '2014_59')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article',

She is a 1968 graduate of Tougaloo College in Jackson and a 1971 graduate of the University of Wisconsin Law School “She grew up in the era of very difficult civil rights advances throughout the South  and I think she’s a byproduct of those struggles ” said Martin W  Healy  chief legal counsel for the Massachusetts Bar Association and legal counsel to the Joint Bar Committee on Judicial Appointments that reviewed applications for the post  “She’s very cognizant of civil rights issues and police misconduct involving minorities ”Patrick  who leaves office in January  has appointed 158 people to the bench — 18 percent of them minorities — not counting Hines and two other recent appointees who are awaiting confirmation   nHines is 66  meaning she will serve about four years before hitting the court’s mandatory retirement age of 70 If confirmed  she said  “I will labor with every fiber of my being to validate your trust in my ability to be a wise and fair judge of every issue that comes before the court ” nHines  who lives in Roxbury  began her career working on prisoners’ rights litigation as a staff attorney at the Massachusetts Law Reform Institute  In the mid 1970s she practiced criminal law with the Roxbury Defenders’ Committee  where she worked with Ireland She was among the cofounders of New England’s first law firm composed of women of color  Burnham  Hines   Dilday  She has dealt with her share of controversial cases  In 2012  she disappointed victims of a rabbi’s sexual abuse by sentencing the defender to probation rather than jail time  That same year  she authorized an East Boston bank to foreclose on the North End condo of former House Speaker Salvatore F  DiMasi after he was sentenced to prison for federal public corruption charges  In 2008  after a defense witness was unable to appear at trial  she granted a mistrial in the murder case of a man accused of poisoning his wife by lacing her Gatorade with antifreeze   He was later convicted at a new trial   While Hines has worked with groups like the American Civil Liberties Union  Healy described her  judicial record as reflecting strong support for “individual rights ” She has sided with individuals faced with anti SLAPP lawsuits  or Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation  intended to intimidate or silence critics  For instance  in 2007  she dismissed a counterclaim by the Town of Falmouth against residents who repeatedly legally challenged construction of a sewage treatment plant  upholding the residents’ right to petition  “She hasn’t been known to be liberal in sentencing ” said Healy  “I think she’s known as a no nonsense judge  If someone deserves society’s punishment and deserves to serve time  she’s not afraid to impose that punishment ”“I know her as a judge who is very concerned about developing the facts and being very careful to apply the law ” said Lisa Goodheart  a lawyer who previously chaired Patrick’s Judicial Nominating Commission  “She’s a careful purist ” Goodheart said Hines is “very widely respected in the legal community” and she praised her deep experience as a lawyer and a judge in both the trial and appeals courts  “At every stage  she just has demonstrated what a class act and quality mind she is ” she said  Hines began her judicial career in 2001 as an associate justice of the Superior Court and has been serving as an associate justice to the Appeals Court since last year  “She embodies every quality you would want of a justice of the Supreme Judicial Court ” said Appeals Court Judge Diana Maldonado  “She’s compassionate  She’s kind  She’s humane  She’s friendly  She’s thoughtful  She’s intelligent  She’s articulate  She analyzes well  She writes well  She’s always thinking  but she’s always applying it in a very human way ”At the governor’s announcement of her nomination during a State House press conference on Friday  Hines declined to characterize her judicial philosophy “I’m really not in a position to open up on that just yet ” she said  “There will be a hearing before the Governor’s Council  where I expect to answer any and all questions about what I think  what I believe  and how a judge should function ”Due to a happy coincidence of timing  Hines’s 91 year old mother was in town for the announcement and was able “to bear witness to the fruits of her constant nagging ” Hines joked “Looking back on my humble beginnings as a child of the segregated South and all that Jim Crow represented  a flood of emotions wash over me and an abundance of words that might be spoken about a day like today ” Hines said   Patrick said that he is “in awe of” Hines “and all she has accomplished with unmatched intelligence  devotion and grace ” Early in his administration  Patrick  who worked as a top civil rights official under President Clinton  fielded criticism  including from Hines  about the limited number of minorities he was appointing to the bench  just 10 2 percent of his nominees by the end of 2008  Over time  however  the governor’s record has dramatically changed Ireland  who became the first black chief justice  announced in March that he would retire effective July 25  Associate Justice Ralph Gants will succeed him  opening up a seat for Hines as an associate justice Even though Hines also will be required to retire in a few years  Gants noted that the span is “nearly a full gubernatorial term ” and said  “one can do a lot of good in that time period ”“She will hit the ground running ” Gants said  citing Hines’s experience  “She will be a true complement for our team of justices ”', '2014_846')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article',

awarding the billion dollar contract to the French firm Keolis  two people briefed on the decision said Friday  The recommendation  for the largest operating contract in state history  would still require a vote from the board of directors that oversees the MBTA and state Department of Transportation  The board is scheduled to meet on Wednesday “Keolis has been selected  The one thing remaining is the board approval ” said one of the people briefed on the deal  who was not authorized to comment  “The T board is the wild card ”The proposed deal — to begin when the current contract expires at the end of June — calls for an eight year term with the possibility of multiple two year options after that  said the person  who added that MBTA General Manager Beverly A  Scott personally took part in negotiations with Keolis executives in Boston earlier this week  MBTA officials declined to comment  beyond saying through a spokesman that Scott would bring a recommendation for either Keolis or current contractor MBCR to one of the two board meetings this month  scheduled this Wednesday and  on Jan  29  “The MBTA commuter rail services contract procurement process is ongoing  and the process must be respected until it is completed ” spokesman Joe Pesaturo said in an e mail   nIf approved  the potential new contract would end the 11 year run of the Massachusetts Bay Commuter Railroad Co  to maintain and operate the commuter rail system that fans out from North and South stations  ferrying about 70 000 workers daily along lines that reach as far as Rhode Island  Worcester  and the North Shore An in house panel  led by the MBTA’s chief financial officer and former acting general manager  Jonathan R  Davis  has been working with consultants in closed door meetings and keeping close tabs on the reams of materials submitted by the two bidders  the people briefed said  But the full roster of the panel and the details of its work to vet the bids  culminating in Scott’s recommendation  remain a secret  The panel is distinct from the governor appointed board of directors that helps guide MassDOT policy and has the final vote on major infrastructure and operating contracts  Multiple members of the board of directors said they either had not been briefed yet on Scott’s recommendation or could not comment on the process that led to the recommendation for the rail contract “This is one of those where we’re protected  from divulging  by not knowing  If I was being tortured  I could honestly say I don’t know ” said Alan Macdonald  one of the six appointed members on a board that also includes the secretary of transportation  Macdonald  former executive director of the Massachusetts Business Roundtable  said after months of briefings and summary materials  the board is awaiting the final recommendation with a responsibility “not to supplant the general manager’s opinion on the recommendation  but  to  verify that it is a recommendation that is warranted by the bid itself ” nThe Boston based MBCR  an international consortium started by a former MBTA general manager with close ties to the state  took over the commuter rail contract in 2003 — after the T ended a rocky 16 year run contracting with Amtrak — amid promises to control costs and improve service  But  MBCR  which has been paid roughly $300 million a year on a contract that ends June 30  has had its share of problems  including   MBCR leaders have said some of those challenges stemmed from a badly aging fleet owned by the state  which postponed or ran into problems with long promised orders for new equipment  MBCR was founded by James O’Leary  a former MBTA leader who has mentored Richard  A  Davey  the current state secretary of transportation and a former MBCR executive  Davey has recused himself from the selection process and will not vote on the contract  The company hired an advising team that included Doug Rubin  a close political associate of Governor Deval Patrick  That perceived inside track may have dissuaded some companies from the wide bidding pool state officials had hoped to attract  Though more than two dozens firms expressed initial interest  only two — MBCR and Keolis —  to the MBTA in 2012  prior to the time and material intensive final bids  Officials from Keolis and MBCR declined to comment  Friday  While rail market  Its parent company has received mi  reviews in France  with rising ridership accompanied by increasing complaints about delays and crowded trains  At Keolis’s only commuter rail operation in North America — the Virginia Railway Express  which serves Washington  D C   and its Virginia suburbs —internal evaluations of customer satisfaction suggest improvement in the three years since Keolis took over the system  But that two line system pales in comparison with the complexity of running the MBTA’s commuter rail network  the fifth largest in the country in terms of passengers  and maintaining its fleet of about 500 coaches and locomotives   John R  Jenkins  chairman of the state transportation board  said Friday he did not feel comfortable discussing when the board expects to receive a recommendation  much less what the recommendation would be  or how the directors might vote  outside of discussion at the upcoming public board meetings  “You guys are probably wondering why there’s such secrecy around this stuff  but that’s the protocol that we have on all of our bids when they’re out and still open ” said Jenkins  a Natick resident who runs a Dorchester insurance agency  “This one has a few more zeros on it  but we still have to observe the same protocol ”Paul Regan  executive director of the organization that represents municipalities that get T service  said it has been “a little frustrating” to be kept in the dark on such a large contract  But Regan  of the MBTA Advisory Board  said he understands the administration’s desire to protect  the process  Regan said competitive bidding should yield a better experience for commuters and a better deal for taxpayersfirm is picked  “The next contract  should  have more of what works and more ways to hold the vendor responsible and accountable for the service that they put out there under the T’s name ” he said', '2014_96')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no

the depth and breadth of that resilience ” said Tom Grilk  executive director of the Boston Athletic Association  which sponsors the Marathon  t nOn race day  3 150 of the 32 408 runners who answered the starting gun were given slots because they were running for charity  compared with 2 600 the year before  The Boston Athletic Association and John Hancock Financial  another Marathon sponsor  provide nonprofit organizations with bibs so runners could raise money on behalf of charities Some of those entries were reserved for individuals and organizations affected by the bombing  including local hospitals  One Fund Boston  and the Martin W  Richard Charitable Foundation  named for the 8 year old Dorchester boy killed in the attacks Many runners who qualify to participate in the race based on their performance in other marathons also raise money for charity  but the BAA said it  tracks only the contributions raised by those who were wearing one of the charity bibs The experience of the Dana Farber Marathon Challenge  which reported raising more money than any other entry  illustrates the sense of determination that defined this year’s race The runners collected more than $8

knew there was back channeling stuff going on to undermine me on purpose ’’ Murphy said Murphy said he specifically requested Survillo because he is the expert on horses  But some law enforcement

while pleading guilty to murder earlier this week  he flashed what appeared to be a neo Nazi jailhouse tattoo on his right hand Remy’s forearms are covered with elaborately detailed  richly colored tattoos predating his time behind bars  including a grim reaper and a busty nude in fishnet stockings  But as photos of Remy circulated online  it was a small  crudely etched symbol near his thumb and forefinger that stood out to those familiar with prison ink  “88 ” n“That’s definitely a neo Nazi tattoo ” said Mark Potok  a senior fellow with the   which teaches law enforcement to recognize hate groups and symbols  explaining that 88 stands for “HH” — H being the eighth letter in the alphabet — or “Heil Hitler ”Remy’s tattoo is drawn in the runic style  evoking letters used by Germanic people before the Middle Ages  another trope popular with white supremacists  said Potok  The tattoos are common among white inmates nationwide  as much a sign of affiliation for protection and solidarity as of bigotry  he said That adds a new layer to Remy’s unusual statement in court Tuesday  which he began by thanking three men  apparently fellow inmates at the Cambridge jail where he was held “I would like to thank Josh Sullivan  Shane Tresilian  Eddie Stone  and all the guys from Somerville for taking me in  I wish you guys all the best of luck ” last summer  “Blame me for this  not my family ”Remy’s statement came shortly after he pleaded guilty to first degree murder  paving the way for Judge Kathe Tuttman to sentence him to the mandatory term of life without parole  nDefense lawyer Edward P  Ryan Jr  said after the hearing that Remy wrote the statement himself and that he did not recognize the names of the men  but suspected they were fellow Cambridge jail detainees   The handwritten page Remy submitted to the court  littered with misspellings  identified the men as “Josh Sullivin Shane Tilsilion Eddi Stone and all the guys from Summervil ” Public records show men with similar names overlapping with Remy in jail  One was Shane D  Tresilian  a 40 year old who has been in and out of custody for two decades for offenses including throwing a bicycle through a Somerville library window In 2001  a Somerville judge who ordered Tresilian to be held without bail while awaiting trial for a bloody barfight described him as “a dedicated street brawler ignited by substances who poses a clear and present danger to man  beast  or inanimate objects in his path while he is in thrall ”Though Remy  the son of celebrated Red Sox broadcaster Jerry Remy  had a long history of arrests for allegedly abusing or assaulting women  he served only one stint in jail — 81 days while awaiting trial in the winter of 2005 06 — prior to murdering Martel “He was the new kid on the cell block ” said Northeastern University criminologist Jack Levin  speculating that Remy may have grouped himself with an organization or gang along racial lines for solidarity and protection Levin said Remy’s tattoo and his unusual acknowledgment of other inmates in his courtroom address may also offer new light on   an African American man  with scalding water  a bar of soap  and a chair on April 3  “I did what I had to do  I got a child molester ” Remy said after the incident  according to court records  His victim  Jemery Hodges  has pleaded guilty in Mississippi to transporting a minor to engage in commercial sex acts  and is awaiting trial locally on charges of possession and distribution of child pornography Of the three men with names similar to the ones Remy listed  only Tresilian remains in the Cambridge jail  awaiting trial for allegedly stealing a bag containing a laptop and camera from a woman exiting the Central Square MBTA station last spring  just days before he punched and spit at officers who tried to restrain him after a fight in Cambridgeport  according to court records Joshua Sullivan  20  of Somerville  was held there until January  when he was sent to MCI Cedar Junction — the state prison in Walpole  where Remy arrived Tuesday — after pleading guilty to armed assault with intent to murder and other charges  for his role in an attempted stickup of a drug dealer that left a Roxbury man bleeding from a gunshot wound to the chest Edward A  Stone  a homeless 25 year old  previously served time in federal prison for a failed Everett bank robbery  He overlapped with Remy in jail while awaiting trial for driving under the influence of drugs in Cambridge and using counterfeit bills in Everett  He was released earlier this month on probation after pleading guilty to those crimes Kristina Hill — Martel’s close friend and next door neighbor — and two other former neighbors from the Waltham apartment complex where Remy and Martel lived said that Remy’s hand tattoo appeared to be new “It doesn’t shock me ” Hill said  noting that Remy boasted to her on the first day they met that he wanted a swastika tattoo Jailhouse tattoos can be rendered with paper clips or other bits of metal or sharp plastic and colored with ink from pens  Kevin Maccioli  a Middlesex sheriff’s office spokesman  said the jail has a policy against inmate tattooing  The jail also catalogues each inmate’s tattoos and scars at intake  but he said state law and department policy prevent him from saying whether Remy’s tattoo is new or was the subject of any discipline Levin said Remy’s statement — and his tattoo — were “certainly not designed to endear himself to the judge ” But given the mandatory sentence  Remy may have been more interested in endearing himself to fellow inmates  he said “When you get very little respect  as prisoners do from the outside world  it becomes extremely important to be respected by fellow inmates ” he said  in

officials for Boston police to get tougher on crime  to find a better  firmer approach to stem the bloodshed  But heeding this natural gut response to the homicide spike would be shortsighted  Those concerned will likely first turn to New York  which has homicide rates that are low and stable — since 2000  Boston has nearly always had more murders per capita  Yet looking only at homicides to measure safety can be deceiving  A deeper review of the past two decades reveals that Boston’s targeted  community based strategy to policing has yielded less dangerous  more livable streets without resorting to the draconian methods favored by the New York Police Department   t nBoston and New York are vastly safer than in the early 1990s  At that decade’s start  both cities experienced crack related homicide epidemics  with more than 24 murders per 100 000 inhabitants  Less than ten years later  that number had fallen dramatically — New York cut homicides from 2 245 in 1990 to 633 in 1998  Boston saw an even bigger proportional drop  from 143 in 1990 to 31 in 1999 Each city  however  took very different paths to achieve that dramatic decrease  Both employed a variant on the idea of “neighborhood policing ” which was described by William Bratton  who would later lead both cities’ forces  as “a partnership with citizens and all relevant public and private agencies to identify  aggressively attack  and successfully solve problems that are engendering crime  disorder  and fear ” Yet within that definition  Boston chose to emphasize partnership  while New York focused in on the aggressive attack of disorder These decisions largely reflect the conditions on the ground at the time  From 1985 to 1993  homicide rates were nearly always  on average  about 50 percent higher in New York than Boston  The Big Apple is vast and more heterogeneous  The crack epidemic emerged just as New York transitioned from Ed Koch  a tough talking mayor  to David Dinkins  who considered himself a racial healer  At least some voters blamed Dinkins for the drug scourge  and the city turned to Rudy Giuliani  who talked even tougher than Koch and interpreted his mandate as making New York safe at any cost The NYPD began hiring swaths of new cops  who were instructed in the “broken windows” approach of cracking down on petty crime in the hopes of preventing larger offenses  It worked  Arrests soared  taking potential criminals off the streets  and crime dropped  But this strategy came at a cost — it only fueled a long simmering anger between the NYPD and residents in New York’s less affluent neighborhoods  One Baptist minister went as far as accusing Giuliani of being “a racist who is on the verge of creating a fascist state in New York City ” t nBoston’s approach to community policy  on the other hand  reflected the smaller  more tribal nature of our city  In the 1970s  racial hatred seemed like a more pressing problem than crime  and the subsequent election of mayors Ray Flynn and Tom Menino showed residents’ desire to mend the city’s social fabric Indeed  an important crime fighting relationship built during the 1990s was the groundbreaking connection between the Boston Police Department and the African American clergy who’d come together to form the Ten Point Coalition  Under Bratton’s leadership — and later  commissioners Paul Evans and Ed Davis — the BPD found collaboration with the ministers and  eventually  the two parties were meeting regularly to share information about what was happening on city streets   More recently  that has evolved into BPD officers partnering with local residents to address problems  including gun violence  in hot spots such as the Bowdoin Geneva neighborhood  But individuals  not just neighborhoods  could be targeted for interventions  To be sure  both New York and Boston adopted strategies that put resources toward risky people and risky places  which is vital because  as the data shows  shootings — a more accurate measure of violence than murders  whether a victim dies can depend on factors as variable as pure luck — are usually highly concentrated among a small group of residents and committed at a small number of places   demonstrated that only 5 percent of Boston street corners and blocks experienced more than 70 percent of shootings between 1980 and 2008  Indeed  the 2006 and 2013 shootings maps show highly similar concentrations of shootings across Boston’s neighborhoods  Moreover  according to the Harvard research  roughly 1 percent of Boston youth between the ages of 15 and 24 participated in gangs  Yet these gang dynamics generated more than half of all homicides  Gang members were involved in roughly 70 percent of fatal and non fatal shootings as either a perpetrator and or a victim  New York’s justly famous program Compstat let police use technology and data to see exactly where crime was occurring and where to crack down  BPD also targets risky places  as it does with its Safe Street Teams  but some of its most remarkable work has involved targeting high risk people  with programs like Operation Ceasefire  In simpler terms  New York’s targeting was a bit more Bloomberg high tech  whereas Boston’s has been a bit more focused on Menino like face to face interactions   nIn Boston  the power of social knowledge showed itself quickly  Consider efforts to end a series of shootings that erupted on Wendover Street in 1994  Partnerships  with probation officers and the violence prevention group Streetworkers especially  gave cops the ability to target gang members  punishing them — and just them — for minor offenses  The message was clear  We’re here because of the shooting  and until it stops  nobody is going to so much as jaywalk  nor make any money  nor have any fun Such highly targeted community interventions were replicated and expanded to great success  Importantly  these law enforcement efforts were balanced by offers of social services and job opportunities to gang youth made available through a well coordinated network of community based organizations and social service agencies Homicide rates in smaller cities are always more volatile  Also  gang violence is cyclical and especially so under the community approach Boston has taken  But the good news is that  since 1994  BPD has always managed to bring homicides back down  Why  Because Boston’s experience also tells us that these homicide epidemics are offset by other  broader benefits  Boston has both fewer police and fewer arrests per capita than New York  Its police force has also avoided controversial procedures like New York’s stop and frisk program  which angered communities and a federal judge ruled in 2013 to be unconstitutional  The BPD’s social skills were also on display  in its more peaceful and effective handling of the Occupy movement  and  more recently  when parts of the Marathon bombing investigation were crowdsourced And  until the last few months  serious violent crime was down in Boston — by 30 percent between 2006 and 2012  Equally impressive  total arrests decreased by 33 percent during the same period  The recent upswing in violence  however  can’t be ignored  Crime has not traveled far in Boston — the neighborhoods such as Dorchester  Roxbury  and Mattapan that were prone to violence 20 years ago remain the same today  The police alone can’t banish violence from these neighborhoods  Mayor Walsh must fight hard to improve education and economic opportunities in these places  Study after study has demonstrated that violent crime does decrease with economic success  Young people  only miles from one of the country’s leading tech hubs  need to hear the case that selling software is more lucrative in the long run than selling drugs Moreover  Boston’s broader “network of capacity” that prevents serious violence may not be as well connected and coordinated as it was in the 1990s  Many of the social service and community based partnerships that worked so well are neither as well funded nor as focused as they were in the past  The city was safest when law enforcement  social services  and community based groups responded together to the small number of people and small number of places that generate most of the violence  To this end  Walsh has taken a step in the right direction by appointing Suffolk County prosecutor Daniel Mulhern and former probation officer Leon Graves to coordinate and focus these non law enforcement partners We won’t judge the appropriateness of New York’s methods for New York — it is a hard place to keep safe  On policing  however  Boston has shown itself to be far more innovative for years by working within the community to listen to its concerns and to build mutual trust  Now is the time for the community to return that trust', '2014_151')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article',

New England Patriot star allegedly orchestrated the killing of Odin L  Lloyd  who was killed with the same type of weapon  prosecutors alleged In paperwork filed in Bristol Superior Court this week  prosecutors said they want jurors at Hernandez’s upcoming first degree murder trial to hear testimony from Hernandez’s childhood friend  Robert Paradis  who is prepared to testify that Hernandez told him he had a  45 pistol  t nAccording to Bristol District Attorney C  Samuel Sutter’s office  Hernandez asked Paradis to make sure a black shirt was in the dresser he was using at a Los Angeles hotel on April 30  2013  At the time  Hernandez was flying back to Boston  prosecutors said “Shortly after leaving for the airport  the defendant called Paradis and asked him to check and see if a black T shirt was in the top drawer in his bedroom ’’ prosecutors wrote  “Paradis checked the drawer as requested and found a large gun wrapped in the black T shirt  Paradis knew it was a large handgun by feel but did not unwrap it to determine the make or model ”Paradis told Hernandez the gun was wrapped inside the shirt  “The defendant stated ‘okay’ and then hung up ’’ prosecutors said Also with Paradis and Hernandez in Los Angeles was Ernest Wallace  who is accused along with another long time friend  Carlos Ortiz  of participating in Lloyd’s murder  Wallace and Ortiz have both pleaded not guilty According to the prosecution  while in Los Angeles  “Hernandez also commented to Wallace and Paradis when the three were out in their rental car that he had ‘fire’ or ‘heat’ under the seat ’’Lloyd was shot to death at a North Attleborough industrial park in June 2013 with a  45 caliber pistol after he was picked up at his Dorchester home by Hernandez  Wallace  and Ortiz  according to prosecutors  The murder weapon has not been found  but ballistic evidence shows he was killed by a  45 caliber pistol  prosecutors have said A law enforcement official briefed on the case said Lloyd was shot multiple times Hernandez has pleaded not guilty and is being held without bail Prosecutors also want Bristol Superior Court Judge E  Susan Garsh to ban the defense from calling an expert witness they want to testify about the effects of PCP use on the brain  There is no evidence that Hernandez himself used PCP when Lloyd was killed June 17  2013  the prosecution said “The Commonwealth asserts that there will be no evidence of the use of PCP by any defendant on the date of the murder ’’ prosecutors wrote  “The defense seeks to mislead the jury by raising the bogey man of the illicit use of PCP without being able to show how it in any way has relevance to the events of the murder ’’The defense  the prosecution said  is trying to keep the prosecution “in the dark so that his expert can attribute certain murderous behaviors to ingestation of PCP where there is no evidence that such drug was consumed close enough in time to be relevant ’’The defense wants to call Dr  David Greenblatt  a medical expert on marijuana and PCP  according to court records The defense has not formally notified the prosecution — as required under court rules — that they will use a “diminished capacity’’ defense when the trial begins in January  prosecutors said  Generally  a diminished capacity defense is used to show jurors the accused had mental weaknesses that prevented them from making the right choices at the time of the crime While insisting that Hernandez was free of PCP when Lloyd was killed  the prosecution did say that two of his allies who are also charged with Lloyd’s murder — Wallace and Ortiz — used PCP about 27 hours before the killing Both men have pleaded not guilty to murder charges and are scheduled to be tried separately for their alleged roles in Lloyd’s killing Hernandez has also been arrested and charged in the July 2012 killings of Safiro Furtado and Daniel Abreu  in Boston  He has pleaded not guilty in that Suffolk County case  n', '2014_192')","('no

worker program  which will merge in the new year with the Boston Foundation’s StreetSafe program to create one unified team reaching out to gang members and at risk youths  nOn Jan  1  StreetSafe Boston  which has 13 street workers  will move under the purview of the Boston Centers for Youth   Families  which already runs the city’s larger street worker program  The Boston Foundation  which unveiled StreetSafe in December 2008  will still fund the program  and the nonprofit philanthropy has pledged at least $3 1 million to keep it going for the next three years  n t n“We thought we would be closing the program down at this point  and instead it has a new life and an ambitious framework ” said Paul Grogan  the foundation’s president  “I think this is really the best possible result that we could have imagined ”StreetSafe  he said  was not designed to be a permanent program  and the foundation did not have the resources to continue managing it  It was slated to end Dec  31  he said  When the city heard StreetSafe was to be shuttered  officials started thinking about how to preserve it  Felix Arroyo  chief of Health   Human Services for Boston  led talks between the city and the foundation at the request of Mayor Martin J  Walsh  In a statement  Walsh said the new  combined program will allow the city to present a “united front” in preventing violence The city has had its own street worker program since 1990  and has 32 street workers and five “violence interruptors” working under the Boston Centers for Youth   Families  Both roles involve walking through areas of the city  such as parts of Dorchester and Mattapan  where gang activity is a problem  violence interruptors work with the highest risk youths  while street workers reach out to young people at all levels — from gang members to the kids at loose ends hanging out in front of the library  City workers are assigned to different neighborhoods  and work to connect young people in those areas to services like job training  GED classes  and trauma counseling  The StreetSafe workers have a very similar mission  said Christopher Byner  interim executive director of the Boston Centers for Youth   Families  who helped orchestrate the collaboration  But their target population is the most active members of Boston’s gangs  and workers are assigned not by neighborhood but by gang  nStreetSafe workers will be able to apply for positions as violence interruptors in the new program  said Byner  but they are not guaranteed jobs StreetSafe  which often hires workers with criminal records  has been controversial at times  some street workers have been fired  one after an arrest for passing counterfeit bills  and another after an arrest for assaulting a police officer  Two others were dismissed after being seen hanging out in an area known for drug dealing  And StreetSafe has not met the lofty targets the foundation set at its inception — to decrease gang involved shootings by 60 percent in the five neighborhoods where most shootings take place  and decrease youth homicides by 30 percent  “We didn’t meet all the goals we set ” Grogan said  “They were incredibly ambitious  On the other hand  crime and youth violence in Boston declined significantly over the life of StreetSafe ”As part of the merger  the city will adopt StreetSafe’s deployment strategy  the entire enlarged staff will work directly with gangs and gang members  rather than covering particular geographic areas  Byner said “The difference is  you follow the young folks ” said Robert Lewis Jr   who founded both the city street worker program and StreetSafe  and was happy to hear they are merging  “A young dude is a high impact player  he needs to get out of that area  he leaves  If you’re working in neighborhoods  once that person left the neighborhood  he’s gone  If you’re working with gangs  you follow him no matter where he goes ”The story of Derek Smith  a young man headed down the wrong path  and Arthur Kitty  the man he now calls his mentor  epitomizes the way the street worker and violence interruptor model is supposed to work  Smith  now 24  always used to carry a gun  He’d rather be caught with it  he used to say  than without it  He grew up in a tough neighborhood and had spent time in jail  But one day  as he left Dorchester District Court  Smith ran into Kitty  a former StreetSafe worker who had become a violence interruptor in the city program  “What do you do ” Smith remembers asking Kitty  “Do you help people ”Kitty  who spent nine years in prison on manslaughter and gun charges  said he often meets young men who act brashly  without thinking  He tries to talk them through the feelings they may not even be aware of  Why are you angry  What do you need  Could there be another way  Kitty lived the same life  He understands He and Smith began talking  Smith stopped carrying a gun and started thinking about how to get involved in his daughter’s life  and get a job  When Kitty helped him write a cover letter for a resume  and called Smith a hard worker  dedicated and articulate  Smith realized he had started thinking of himself in an entirely new way  “I don’t hang out with the same crowd  I don’t hang out on the same corner  I don’t sell drugs  That’s not an option for me now  And that came directly from this man and his organization ” said Smith  “I just look at the streets a little different ”', '2014_332')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no

encountered the man — who was black  according to Wexler — Bratton lowered his firearm and asked the robber to do the same  “He got him to drop the gun ” said Wexler  “It was all about slowing things down  de escalation ”Over time  “race would become Bratton’s defining issue ” said Wexler  with Bratton’s commitment to reducing crime by finding common ground between the police and communities of color But over a storied career  Bratton’s methodology has had its skeptics — whether it’s his adoption in New York of the broken window theory of policing  where police confront minor crimes and nuisances as a way to reduce major ones  or by expanding stop and frisk  as he did as chief of the Los Angeles police from 2002 to 2009  Both policies disproportionately affect blacks and Latinos  critics say When he came to LA  racial tensions were high  it was a sensitive era  after police officers who beat Rodney King were acquitted  Bratton’s expansion of stop and frisk was controversial  but he also got high marks for working on gang violence and police misconduct issues Say what you want about Bratton  he knows what he believes  And he’s not afraid to say what he thinks or take credit — or blame for what he does When deBlasio appointed him police commissioner a year ago  Bratton promised he would bring “a new day” to policing Despite the fallout from protests after a grand jury failed to indict the police officer involved in the death of Eric Garner of Staten Island  and the tragedy of two murdered police officers  Bratton says he’s delivering on that promise “It’s a new day in the sense that some of the issues that are causing so much anger and frustration are also being addressed ” he said  citing his de emphasis on stop and frisk He passionately defends the NYPD  yet acknowledges “we make a lot of mistakes  We are only human ”Police  he said  are on the front lines of the social fall out from the great economic inequality that divides this country  This week  Bratton pointed out  the Dow topped 18 000  yet the gap between rich and poor is ever widening “Until you walk in the shoes of a police officer trying to police these neighborhoods of deprivation  you don’t know what it’s like  ” said Bratton As the NYPD mourns its dead  Bratton hopes the rhetoric on all sides ratchets down in a search for common ground “The devil incarnate” said he intends to lead the way  n•  n•  n•  n', '2014_69')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no

games A few notes for you  n• Edward Mujica did not enter a high leverage situation on Wednesday  The Sox were up by four runs when he came in to face the Orioles in the seventh inning  But he showed high leverage stuff against Nelson Cruz  striking him out on three pitches The third pitch was particularly nasty  PitchF x called it a splitter and that is what John Farrell termed it  too  But Mujica says it’s a changeup “I don’t hold it like a splitter ” he said after the game  grabbing a baseball to demonstrate  “I use three fingers and it’s more of a changeup  But you can call it a splitter if you want ”Mujica said the pitch usually drops like a splitter would  but sometimes cuts into a righthanded hitter “I don’t know what it’s going to do sometimes ” Mujica said  “That’s good  right ” nMujica is the seventh inning man now  But that could change over time as needs arise • Xander Bogaerts in two games  Line out to left field that was nearly a home run  fly ball to right  double to right  walk  single to left  walk  walk  grounder to shortstop You can credit his uncle  Glenroy Brown  for the all field approach  “He always told me to look to hit the ball up the middle ” Bogaerts said  “I’ve always tried to use all the field ”• David Ortiz was 2 for 37 in spring training and struck out 13 times  He has two hits in two games  one a home run  and struck out once  The lesson as always  don’t pay attention to spring training statistics • Both teams are annoyed at the idea of playing a night game this evening  The Sox have a 2 05 p m  game back in Boston on Friday and the Orioles have a 1 08 p m  game in Detroit Night games tend to draw better than day games on weekdays  But the Orioles are inconveniencing their own players in this case because any game they play against the Red Sox would draw well • On the flip side of Ortiz is Will Middlebrooks  He had a great spring training but is so far 0 for 7 with three strikeouts  But he has twice hit the ball hard the other way and that’s a good indication his swing is in synch • It’ll be interesting to see where Shane Victorino slots into the lineup once he returns because the 2 3 4 of Dustin Pedroia  Ortiz and Mike Napoli is pretty appealing to John Farrell  Getting Ortiz up in the first inning makes a lot of sense • Not in a game yet  Burke Badenhop  Clay Buchholz  Chris Capuano  Felix Doubront  Jonathan Herrera  Andrew Miller  Jake Peavy  David Ross and Andrew Workman Who will be the last man standing  A few names could fall off the list Thursday night • No details yet on the ring ceremony on Friday  although it was described last night as “pretty extensive ” The Sox invited every player back and obviously those playing elsewhere will not attend  But Ryan Dempster will be back  Wonder if he will be in uniform • Here is hoping the Sox will invite UConn guard Shabazz Napier to throw out a first pitch after he’s home from the Final Four  Napier is from Roxbury • The Celtics  in a coincidence  were at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center at the same time the Red Sox were on Tuesday and the players intermingled as they visited some of the wounded veterans One patient had his wife and mother with him  “His mom had an Oklahoma City Thunder shirt on and his wife was wearing a Yankees jersey ” Mike Napoli said  “Everybody had a good laugh over that ”',

police reports  set out in mundane  relentless detail  Globe data visualization reporter Gabriel Florit analyzed more than four years of reports on domestic violence between intimate partners in Boston  up to April 2014  That is when the police department changed the way it reports these incidents  providing less detail on this world of cruelty and terror Soon  the police reports will be made less accessible statewide   that shields them from public view unless a case goes to court  It is a step designed to protect victims who may be afraid to come forward if their identities become public  But that potential good comes at too high a price  The new law also shields abusers from scrutiny  and closes a window on a world that must remain vivid  unforgettable The reports are a critical record of the evil enacted in homes across the city  Laid end to end  they reveal the massive scale of the problem  And not just its vastness  but its pervasiveness  The potential for violence saturates every minute of a victim’s day  Look at the list of weapons  the cat and the lamp alongside the machete and the crowbar   Witness  too   in Middleborough  where a mi  martial arts fighter allegedly encouraged a bull terrier to attack his beaten wife   You can imagine the moments that exploded  at breakfasts and dinners  in kitchens and living rooms  You can see inside the homes where abusers lurk every day  reaching for whatever object is nearby to impose their will  t nWe know all too well where many of those everydays end —   for example  Most of us don’t see the moments that can lead to those ends  We get to know the victims who die  but not those who call police  worried they might be next  There are so many more of them  They are dots on a map  nAnd beyond those dots lie countless others to whose homes police never come  because the people who would have made the calls were too embarrassed or afraid  Or because they got so used to torment they couldn’t see it for what it was  Or because their abusers promised to make things better  giving a glimpse of what made them attractive in the first place “I would just let him keep hitting me and abusing me ” said Tuti  “And after  he would make me feel special again  They can be so sweet  then they just turn crazy ”The women around the table nodded  Having recently fled their partners  they live with their young children at the shelter  run by domestic violence prevention outfit Casa Myrna  They did not want their full names used for fear their attackers might find them  A couple of them have so little perspective on their abuse that they still blame themselves  All of them are certain that luck and timing alone separate their fates from Martel’s “What’s going through her mind when she’s being stabbed ” Trinity asked  “ u2009‘Damn  I should have left ’ u2009”Each of the four women knows others who are still stuck in the lives they escaped  These victims are also bystanders  facing the same fears and questions their own loved ones and neighbors did when they were being abused  Should they call the police  Would that put them in danger too One time  Tuti was in a car with a friend whose boyfriend hit her “like  boom  and her head cracked the glass ” Tuti kept quiet  worried the boyfriend or his friends would come after her if she reported him  She wasn’t sure if that was the right thing to do “If you have a friend and it’s happening  how would you come about it ” she asked the others  “I wouldn’t want something to happen to me and my daughter ”Miladas  a small framed 20 year old whose abuse has left her angry and untrusting  told Tuti she was right to keep quiet  It was up to her friend to extricate herself “Just don’t get in it ” Miladas said  “If she’s not doing something about it  she doesn’t want to ”Tuti agreed  And besides  she said  she didn’t want to be known as a snitch The funny  fast talking 19 year old was with her abusive boyfriend for 2½ years  He isolated her from her family  Sometimes he would lock her in a room  or take all of her shoes to make it that much harder to leave The days had a grim rhythm to them  a rhythm matched by the Boston incident reports  which show calls to police rising steadily through the day and peaking at night  after dinner and drinks  after kids are put to bed  after partners return from nights out  and when more neighbors are around to hear screams and call police “Nighttime was the worst ” Tuti said  “At night  the fights would get real strong ” nDuring the day  Trinity  21  was in classes  and safe  The outgoing  red haired student at an alternative high school hopes to be an accountant “I came home         and he’d leave ” she said of her boyfriend  “He’d come back late and         we would start fighting ”The end came after a Black Friday shopping trip in 2012  The couple bought a video game  diapers  some toys for her son  That night  they argued because Trinity had seen her boyfriend give his number to another woman at the mall  Their bargains became weapons  He hit her in the head with the video game  pummeled her with the packet of Pampers The fight spilled out onto the landing outside their door “The way he looked at me  his eyes were red ” she said  “I felt myself being lifted up from the ground  He held me over the second floor banister  and he was choking me  ‘I’m gonna kill you  I’m gonna kill you ’ u2009”Here it was  The daily ritual of abuse turned deadly “I was thinking about my dad and my son and the baby I lost ” Trinity said  “All I heard was my son crying ”Then  for whatever reason  he relented  When police came  she initially declined to press charges  But she left him  and did it the next day “I walked out of court with my restraining order and my head held high ” she said  “I’m living my life ” She seems determined to stay out of the world captured in those police reports  now fading from view  She wants her son to grow up to be respectful to women  not yield to the abusiveness that flows through his extended family Trinity is spending time these days with someone who seems kind  though she concedes it’s hard to judge  Her abuser seemed nice when she first met him  too  “going to school with his little book bag ” She wonders why she didn’t leave him sooner  why she stayed with someone who could have killed her  instead of finding someone else “There’s more sharks in the sea ” she said  speaking more truth than she knew  n•  n•  n•  n•  n•  n•  n', '2014_516')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article',

residents has been collecting signatures on a petition to be submitted to Mayor Martin J  Walsh  calling for the city to revisit the plan to replace the Dearborn building   nTheir concerns include what they describe as the failure by the city to adequately consult neighbors before settling on the demolition plan  the addition of three grades could bring afternoon traffic to a standstill on the neighborhood’s narrow  sloped streets  and potential other uses of the building  such as for a high school or housing  were not discussed  The petition also cites several vacant lots and buildings in nearby Dudley Square and Uphams Corner where the academy could be built  nNearby residents and property owners plan to meet Tuesday at Southern Baptist Church on Winthrop Street to discuss the petition  which they said had 70 signatures Monday  nThe STEM academy would be the city’s first new public school building in more than a decade  Adding further complexity  district officials recently proposed opening  n   t nResidents interviewed Monday say that the Greenville Street building  dedicated in 1912  is as much a part of the landscape as the rows of three deckers and apartments  It formerly served as the High School of Practical Arts  Girls’ High School  and  most recently  the Dearborn Middle School  It is part of Roxbury’s Moreland Street Historic District  though it is not separately designated as a historical landmark “People are proud of the fact that this neighborhood is a historic district ” said Lorraine Wheeler  a Moreland Street resident involved in the petition  “They just believe that the architecture of that school building fits with the neighborhood  At the very least they just want to walk through the process of whether there are better functions for that school ”Spokesman Brian Ballou said Monday that the school district had given proper notice for all of the meetings concerning the Dearborn project  and residents will be notified about the demolition plans by mail at a later date  Construction is scheduled to begin next year  He said no other sites were considered for the STEM academy after an original plan calling for renovations to the existing building was rejected On the traffic concerns  Ballou said  designated drop off and pickup spots at the new facility would “practically eliminate the congestion that previously occurred on Greenville and Winthrop streets in the morning and afternoons ” Nadine Riggs  a 51 year old who lives across the street from the school  says she feels the details of the plan were kept under wraps for too long Riggs said she received a blue flier last July advising “The Dearborn School is Changing” that turned out to be from another neighborhood group  She didn’t think much of it at the time  she said  as few took it seriously because it lacked a letterhead or an official seal  No one  she said  thought the fate of the towering brick building itself was in jeopardy  She and other residents said they received official notices from the school district concerning meetings last fall  but said the notices did not go into specifics  Riggs said the decision to demolish the building seems paradoxical “In this country we’re in this whole movement of recycle  reuse ” she said  “There’s a beautiful building  and you just want to tear it down ”Boston City Council member Tito Jackson  who represents Roxbury and who chairs the Education Committee  acknowledged the residents’ concerns Monday  but said a school offering the STEM curriculum would prove fruitful for Roxbury  He said Boston needs such a school  as a technologically advanced city in the 21st century   n“The community engagement component could have been done better ” he said  “but I think we have to figure out how to give this opportunity to people  young people and families ”', '2014_500')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article',

Columbia Road in Dorchester  Words on the check posed a question  “How would you spend 3 million dollars to improve Uphams  nCorner ” It had 24 memo lines  Each read  “I would              ” At first the check hung crooked on the wall  but a woman walking by stopped to help him hang it straight  Then she stood back to look  She got an idea for something she wanted   n“Write it in ” Douglas said “Write it in ” she asked “That’s what the markers are for  Write it in ”She looked at him  marker in hand  and then turned to write on the first line  If she had $3 million to improve Uphams Corner  she would fix the sidewalks  It was the first of many ideas for improvements that were collected by Douglas  who solicited suggestions with several cardboard checks Douglas  whose public artworks stretch back 20 years  uses murals and face to face encounters to give voice to the neighborhoods where he has lived  In part because of his work in Uphams Corner  the Boston Foundation and Dudley Street Neighborhood Initiative recently named him the winner of a citywide public art competition   nDouglas won $100 000 to help engage Uphams Corner residents in a months long brainstorm on bringing art to their neighborhood  Later  another $400 000 will go toward implementing their ideas   n“I think it takes a lot of guts to do what Cedric is doing ” said Mark Matel  a project manager at Nuestra Comunidad Development Corporation  a Roxbury nonprofit that works to improve underserved neighborhoods  “He’s doing public artwork he finds value in  and he’s encouraging other people to participate  which isn’t what you normally see  Usually you see the artist doing everything ”During those spring days in 2013  the community responded to Douglas’s call for ideas on his giant checks  One person wrote  “Do small things to raise community pride ” Another wrote  “Stop the killing ” Many people wanted to make housing more affordable  On a check made out specifically to “Artists of Uphams Corner ” someone wrote  “More murals  more colors ”After he won the grants  Douglas then bought a retired NStar utility vehicle and named it the Up Truck — “Up” for Uphams Corner  “Up” for “What’s up ” He converted the truck into a mobile public art lab  and he’s parking it in various neighborhood spots every weekend through June 21  People can come on board the truck and make art — a different kind of art nearly every weekend Twenty years earlier  in the spring of 1994  16 year old Douglas made his first attempt at sharing art in his neighborhood  He bought three cans of spray paint on a Wednesday afternoon in May  They were black  yellow  and green  the colors of the Jamaican flag  Then he went to the public basketball courts near his home in Quincy His friends were playing ball when he got there  The court was run down  with cracks in the pavement  “You couldn’t even bounce a basketball without it going in eight directions ” he said  He opened his backpack and took out his sketchbook  where he’d drawn a cartoon character he’d made up  Douglas began painting the pavement  “It was my first ever piece ” The players told him it was cool  Then just as he was finishing the edges  a police car pulled in  Douglas packed up and ran  He tore through the woods  emerged in his own neighborhood  and ducked into a friend’s house  He walked home a while later but made it only six blocks before an officer  who he remembers as “the nicest cop ever ” escorted him back to view his work  The officer asked  “Why did you do it ” Douglas answered  “I was just trying to beautify the basketball courts ” When his parents picked him up  he was in a jail cell  They grounded him for a very long time  But within a year  Douglas remembers  something happened that made him think  He found the crumbling neighborhood basketball court repaved and repainted  Douglas stayed in Quincy for eight more years  He attended Bunker Hill Community College  His adviser there  an art teacher  gave him a book called  “Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain ” a drawing instruction book for any person  no matter his ability or field  Douglas attached to the idea that anyone could produce art  Looking out on Uphams Corner from his art studio this spring  Douglas said  “Kids want to get some recognition in the world  It’s like there are a billion people in the world  and you want to have some type of evidence that you exist   That’s what graffiti is  kind of ”Douglas  who earns commissions painting murals for local businesses and institutions  has kept an art studio in Uphams Corner since he graduated from MassArt in 2011 at the age of 33  Sometimes he sees fresh graffiti on nearby walls   “The lady who owns this building is the nicest person ” said Douglas  “I don’t want people writing on this building  It’s going to make the neighborhood look bad ”Last summer he made a PowerPoint presentation of all the blank walls in and around Uphams Corner that could become walls for murals or street art  “I think the city needs to embrace the talent that’s here at a certain age  and let the kids do it ” said Douglas Before painting a mural on an alley wall last fall  he drew his design on paper and asked the neighbors for feedback  He changed his design based on their thoughts  Douglas got the idea for his art truck while he was working on that mural He wanted to collaborate with yet more neighborhood people on art  in someplace less hidden than an alley  He thought  “A truck is perfect  It’s the language of the streets ” Trucks reach more people  Trucks deliver good things  paper  ice cream  packages  A truck could deliver an opportunity to make art  too  When the Boston Foundation opened its $500 000 public art competition  Douglas wrote up his vision and made his entry While he was waiting for the results  he flew to Miami in December and painted a mural at Art Basel  an annual international art show  It was a good diversion  On his assigned wall in Miami’s Wynwood neighborhood  Douglas drew a girl holding up a spray paint can  A giant tyrannosaurus rex emerged from the can  The dinosaur’s back read like an evolution of cities  a subway train rushing beneath a cityscape of pyramids and glittering skyscrapers along the dinaosaur’s spine When Douglas got the call that he had won  was so excited he couldn’t even hear what his grantors were saying to him  He’d made hundreds of sketches of ideas for the truck since he’d filed his application  He introduced his team of artists to the truck on a Tuesday morning in late March  They had endless ideas  People could screen print their own T shirts and make art with iPads  Douglas pointed to a spot near the rear of the truck  What if they had a caricaturist sitting there  drawing neighborhood people  This would be a special caricaturist — a conversationalist caricaturist — who could talk to people about their dreams for Uphams Corner  Matel  of the Nuestra Comunidad Development Corporation  co led the team that opened Roxbury’s former MBTA Bartlett bus yard for art and community events last summer  He watched Douglas and artist Percy Fortini Wright paint a giant portrait of Rosa Parks on an old garage door  The day before the truck was due to be presented before Mayor Martin J  Walsh  the artists — all of them from Boston — gathered in Bartlett Yard  They took their cans of spray paint to the Up Truck  Fortini Wright painted the outline of a triple decker on the freshly primed and sanded truck wall  Ricardo Gomez painted a face  They worked together  right arms outstretched  On a Sunday in April the truck was finally parked in Uphams Corner  It was sunny  There was music playing  Gomez and Fortini Wright were painting more faces  Up Truck team member Avanti Wolcott greeted visitors  A passerby stopped and pushed his headphones to his temples  Douglas approached him  “What’s up  man ” One weekend in May  Douglas and his team set up a T shirt making shop on the truck  They had stencils and screen printing equipment  More than 200 people designed and produced T shirts  Another weekend they set up a photo booth and brought in costumes  People could make up their own outfits and take photos  On Mother’s Day  they drove around Uphams Corner and handed out roses to moms The team  which also includes artists Kate Balug and Julia Roth  installed a voting system inside the truck  They hung framed pictures of the kind of public art Uphams Corner residents have envisioned — things like interactive sculptures  murals  and a permanent creative space  People can paste stars on the ideas they like best And Douglas still asks every person he meets  “What kind of art do you want to have in Uphams Corner ”', '2014_617')","('no article',

judge in Massachusetts  will be the first black woman to serve on the state’s highest court  if confirmed by the Governor’s Council Governor Deval Patrick nominated Hines Friday to fill a Supreme Judicial Court vacancy created by the imminent retirement of Chief Justice Roderick L  Ireland  the first black person appointed to the centuries old high court  nHines grew up in the Mississippi Delta region  according to a biography on the court system’s website  She is a 1968 graduate of Tougaloo College in Jackson and a 1971 graduate of the University of Wisconsin Law School “She grew up in the era of very difficult civil rights advances throughout the South  and I think she’s a byproduct of those struggles ” said Martin W  Healy  chief legal counsel for the Massachusetts Bar Association and legal counsel to the Joint Bar Committee on Judicial Appointments that reviewed applications for the post  “She’s very cognizant of civil rights issues and police misconduct involving minorities “Patrick  who leaves office in January  has appointed 158 people to the bench  18 percent of them members of minority groups  not counting Hines and two other recent appointees who are awaiting confirmation Hines is 66  meaning she will serve about four years before hitting the court’s mandatory retirement age of 70 If confirmed  she said  “I will labor with every fiber of my being to validate your trust in my ability to be a wise and fair judge of every issue that comes before the court ” nHines  who lives in Roxbury  began her career working on prisoners’ rights litigation as a staff attorney at the Massachusetts Law Reform Institute  In the mid 1970s she practiced criminal law with the Roxbury Defenders’ Committee  where she worked with Ireland She was among the cofounders of New England’s first law firm composed of women of color  Burnham  Hines   Dilday She has dealt with her share of controversial cases  In 2012  she disappointed victims of a rabbi’s sexual abuse by sentencing the  ndefendant to probation  rather than jail time  That same year  she authorized an East Boston bank to foreclose on the North End condo of former House Speaker Salvatore F  DiMasi after he was sentenced to prison for federal public corruption charges In 2008  after a defense witness was unable to appear at trial  she granted a mistrial in the murder case of a man accused of poisoning his wife by lacing her Gatorade with antifreeze   He was later convicted at a new trial  While Hines has worked with groups like the American Civil Liberties Union  Healy described her judicial record as reflecting strong support for “individual rights ”She has sided with individuals faced with anti SLAPP lawsuits  or Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation  intended to intimidate or silence critics  For instance  in 2007  she dismissed a counterclaim by the Town of Falmouth against residents who repeatedly legally challenged construction of a sewage treatment plant  upholding the residents’ right to petition “She hasn’t been known to be liberal in sentencing ” said Healy  “I think she’s known as a no nonsense judge  If someone deserves society’s punishment and deserves to serve time  she’s not afraid to impose that punishment ”“I know her as a judge who is very concerned about developing the facts and being very careful to apply the law ” said Lisa Goodheart  a lawyer who previously chaired Patrick’s Judicial Nominating Commission  “She’s a careful purist ”Goodheart said Hines is “very widely respected in the legal community ” and she praised her deep experience as a lawyer and a judge in both the trial and appeals courts  “At every stage  she just has demonstrated what a class act and quality mind she is ” she said Hines began her judicial career in 2001 as an associate justice of the Superior Court and has been serving as an associate justice on the Appeals Court since last year “She embodies every quality you would want of a justice of the Supreme Judicial Court ” said Appeals Court Judge Diana Maldonado  “She’s compassionate  She’s kind  She’s humane  She’s friendly  She’s thoughtful  She’s intelligent  She’s articulate  She analyzes well  She writes well  She’s always thinking  but she’s always applying it in a very human way ”At the governor’s announcement of her nomination during a State House press conference Friday  Hines declined to characterize her judicial philosophy “I’m really not in a position to open up on that just yet ” she said  “There will be a hearing before the Governor’s Council  where I expect to answer any and all questions about what I think  what I believe  and how a judge should function ”Due to a happy coincidence of timing  Hines’s 91 year old mother was in town for the announcement and was able “to bear witness to the fruits of her constant nagging ” Hines joked “Looking back on my humble beginnings as a child of the segregated South and all that Jim Crow represented  a flood of emotions wash over me and an abundance of words that might be spoken about a day like today ” Hines said Patrick said that he is “in awe of” Hines “and all she has accomplished with unmatched intelligence  devotion  and grace ”Early in his administration  Patrick  who worked as a top civil rights official under President Clinton  fielded criticism  including from Hines  about the limited number of minorities he was appointing to the bench  just 10 2 percent of his nominees by the end of 2008 Over time  however  the governor’s record has dramatically changed Ireland  who became the first black chief justice  announced in March that he would retire effective July 25  Associate Justice Ralph Gants will succeed him  opening up a seat for Hines as an associate justice Although Hines will also be required to retire in a few years  Gants noted that the span is “nearly a full gubernatorial term” and that “one can do a lot of good in that time period ”“She will hit the ground running ” Gants said  citing Hines’s experience  “She will be a true complement for our team of justices ”', '2014_1204')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article',

better than Governor elect Charlie Baker to initiate it  Baker downplayed his role in conceiving and implementing the Big Dig during the campaign  He shouldn’t  The long bend of history will prove that the investment was well worth it — even with the spiraling costs and problems with construction  The submerging of the interstate has helped to transform our city and its access to the harbor  launching the Innovation District  and rebooting downtown  t nThe new Boston New York rail connection should be the crown jewel of an ambitious Baker administration transportation plan  Transportation is the one policy area that will have the most transformative effect on the state’s economy  growth  and job creation  From projects large to small  investments made to improve existing  or build new  infrastructure will bring the biggest rewards   Disclosure  My law firm has represented the state Department of Transportation   Case in point  Just the whiff of news that the MBTA was  caused housing prices to spike over the last five years by 37 and 25 percent respectively compared to 9 percent statewide  according to the real estate website Zillow    “ Y ou could put a cardboard outhouse near a Green Line stop  and there’d be a bidding war ”Then there’s the project   which will result in 60 to 65 fresh new acres to develop in Allston — close to Harvard  MIT  Kendall Square  and virtually every transit corridor  Or  as former Transportation Secretary Richard Davey calls it  an “innovation district on steroids ”Another game changer  The expansion of South Station —   himself a tireless advocate of public transit  That project would accomplish several goals at once  It would free up prime real estate for development  and it would unlock a neighborhood or two along Dorchester Avenue — essentially stretching the Fort Point Channel’s waterfront from South Boston well into Dorchester  The expansion could also eventually serve to accommodate an Olympic bid requirement for greater transportation bandwidth  All of these ambitions  however  will require Baker’s leadership  especially when it comes to financing them  Launching new capital investments of any scale has only become harder with November’s repeal of future gas tax increases  which will remove up to $2 billion from state budgets over the next 10 years  And despite  it doesn’t appear that Beacon Hill will pass new revenue measures any time soon And some see investments made in transportation infrastructure as gentrifying forces that price out the poor  Yes  that might happen  But the trick to creating more housing — affordable and otherwise — is to create more housing  not limit progress by stopping transit projects  When the state builds transit  the city must respond with density — not single family homes at the rail terminus as we’ve seen in places like Hyde Park In   Baker has said his early priority is the growing opiate addiction epidemic  That’s an important issue  to be sure  the state’s recent success with  illustrates an excellent route to go   Other observers might suggest his administration tackle education or human services  And  in fact  a strong state government must successfully implement many different initiatives all at once in order to be effective Indeed  the new governor will have plenty of projects on his plate come January  Let’s hope  however  that

searched for his backpack  they found emergency workers trying to revive another homeless man lying in a nearby alley  Assistant District Attorney David Bradley said  The backpack was nearby  nThe man on the ground died  Bradley said  and surveillance video from the scene showed “a different story” than the one Moran told officers about how he sustained his injuries  Instead of a robbery  the video shows a man prosecutors say is Moran walking up to the 56 year old victim and then kicking and beating him On Friday  Moran was ordered held on $50 000 cash bail after he pleaded not guilty in Roxbury Municipal Court to two charges of assault and battery with a dangerous weapon  Bradley said he expects the charges against Moran to be elevated “to more serious charges to reflect the death of the victim ” whom prosecutors have not yet identified Moran stood behind a door during his arraignment  only his elbow was visible His attorney  Bruce Carroll  said his client has no criminal record and was injured during the fight  as well “He’s the one that called the police ” said Carroll  “You can see that he was beaten and beaten pretty badly ” nCarroll said Moran and the victim knew each other

signs of trauma to the victim  and the apparent cause of death was a heart attack  Bradley said  But  he added  the beating probably triggered the heart attack “It’s likely that this event  the heart attack  came as a result of this altercation ” said Bradley  The state medical examiner will continue to investigate  and final results will take two or three months  Bradley said', '2014_842')","('no

feels like a one two punch for many in Boston’s black community First  a grand jury in Missouri declined to indict a police officer for shooting to death an unarmed black teen  Nine days later  a grand jury in New York declined to indict a police officer for choking an unarmed black man to death  t nThere had been optimism that this time things would be different despite a history to the contrary  Rodney King  Danroy “DJ” Henry  Trayvon Martin  All were African American males whose assailants — white men in positions of authority — were not convicted  and in some cases not charged  And now  Michael Brown and Eric Garner  Those who have watched such violent episodes over and over again say their hopefulness has given way to fatigue — and fury And yet hope persists because  civil rights leaders  ministers  politicians  police officers  and youth leaders say  defeatism is not an option “What’s really at stake is the soul of the nation ” the Rev  Osagyefo Uhuru Sekou of First Baptist Church in Jamaica Plain said as he traveled from Ferguson  Mo   to Boston for Thursday night’s protest on the Common  nFrom the White House to City Hall  the country finds itself trying to heal the festering mistrust between the black community and the criminal justice system  exposed recently by Brown’s death on Aug  9 and the nationwide protests — some of them violent — that have erupted since  Demonstrators have shut down highways and closed malls while rallying around the statement “Black Lives Matter ” which has dominated social media Those in Boston’s civil rights community are trying to revamp the “Ten Demandments ” a local call to action sounded 22 years ago after four Los Angeles police officers were found not guilty of the videotaped beating of black motorist Rodney King “We are pitting the community against law enforcement with these types of grand jury decisions that are coming down ” said Darnell Williams  president of the Urban League of Eastern Massachusetts  “People are losing faith  These are all cumulative cases that are in our spirit and our head ”The justice system  he said  must be overhauled  Specifically  he argued  special prosecutors must be used to investigate police use of force cases  body cameras must be worn by police officers  surveillance cameras similar to the “Shot Spotter” gunshot detection system should be installed in high crime areas “The system is not working for us  so it is our duty to destroy it ” Williams said  “This whole Commonwealth was founded and predicated on protest politics  This country has been predicated on us voicing our opinion on those things we need to change ”Right now  some young people in Charlestown and Dorchester say what needs to change is the sense that police officers are above the law The decision to not to charge New York police officer Daniel Pantaleo in Garner’s death sends the message that police can abuse their power  said 18 year old Nueseline Goncalves  a student at Charlestown High “It made me feel like there’s no hope ” she said One of her classmates  Keisha Fertil  said police are seen as heroes while young black men are reflexively seen as suspect  something Jeff Ramos said he knows all too well The 19 year old said he often feels the gaze of officers when he walks home at night after basketball practice  even though he pulls his pants up and tries to look as nonthreatening as possible “When I see police  I get on my toes ” he said  “I try to look away ”Ramos said he worries that he might be confused for a suspect and find himself in a dangerous situation  He said he knows that most officers are fair  but that it’s hard not to see them all in the same light “Instead of authority figures  I see them as bullies ” he said  “And it shouldn’t be that way ”Akim Callendar  23  works security and has no criminal record  But in the eyes of the police  he’s always a suspect  he says  “We’re a menace to society ” he said  “That’s how they see us ”That feeling of being viewed suspiciously by police doesn’t extend only to civilians  some black officers in police blue feel it  too Larry Ellison  a 30 year veteran of the Boston Police Department  said he  too  is approached differently if stopped by police who don’t know he’s an officer of the law “I’m still a black male ” he said  “Being a police officer doesn’t take that away ”Ellison  who is president of the Massachusetts Association of Minority Law Enforcement Officers  says his approach to policing is to treat people as if they were members of his family “You can always go in like a lamb and come out like a lion if need be  but you can never go in like a lion and come out like a lamb ” he said The recent grand jury decisions and community uproar haven’t made his job any more difficult  he said  but they have served as a reminder to do better “You can’t have communities that feel underservedand somewhat under siege ” he said Like Ellison  City Councilor Ayanna Pressley said people need to engage in open and honest conversations about race in order for reconciliation and transformation to occur “This is a burden and walk that we all have to do  and it begins with the willingness to have a conversation about the unconscious bias that all of us carry ” Pressley said  “It is an unconscious bias informed by culture  media  and by personal experience  And we cannot unpack that if people are not even willing to be honest that they are carrying that ”The Boston Police Department knows the dangers of unconscious biases  which is why it tests for them  she said  Still  Pressley said  more must be done to improve community policing  strengthen trust between police and communities of color  and reform the justice system But such measures can seem hollow in the face of what can seem like overwhelming injustices such as Garner’s death  which was ruled a homicide and captured on video  Pressley said “I’m grappling with what to offer that is meaningful and will ease this heartache and this pain ” Pressley said People can march  protest  dialogue  and vote but above all  said the Rev  Arthur T  Gerald Jr   pastor of Twelfth Baptist Church in Roxbury  people must pray There is no time for defeat  he said  The struggle continues and there is work still to be done “The cry of the people ” he said  “is ‘Where’s justice ’ ”Kendrick Jackson  24  who works with teenagers at the Dorchester Youth Collaborative  has been trying to help the teenagers he works with come to terms with what has happened while wrestling with it himself  His hope is that the media attention around Brown’s and Garner’s deaths — and the refusal of grand juries to charge the officers criminally — would awaken the public’s consciousness about racial injustice “Enough is enough ” he said  “Somewhere  there has to be a line ”', '2014_1050')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article',

annual dance music festival Together Boston  The famous disco singer  who died in 2012  grew up in Dorchester  the accident of her stage surname was enough to justify a tribute party on a crystal

orientation  the party drew not just veterans of the disco era  but also little kids and young adults far removed from the cultural upheaval of the ’70s  As darkness fell  people who couldn’t get in to the crowded skating rink could still dance as a Dorchester DJ played “I Feel Love” and other hits  Meanwhile  vendors sold fried dough  Italian ices  and South Asian food  An appropriate tribute to

taking a vacation during the official break period comes with significant challenges  Airlines and hotels charge peak prices  destinations are crowded  and the schedules of other family members may not align with the allotted dates   n What to do “It’s nearly impossible for me to take time off in February  it’s our busiest time of year ” says Paul  a Dorchester father of four  “And who can afford to pay those jacked up prices  We’ll wait and pull the kids out of school for a few days later in the season ”   “Because of the age difference  our kids were at different schools with different vacation dates for much of their school life ” explains Lori Hogan  mother of two from Portsmouth  R I  “We had to get creative  We did short three  and four day trips  missing a day or so of class  but making a lot of wonderful memories ” Not everyone agrees with those sentiments    “We’re not educating kids the same way as when I went to school ” says Michele Brooks  an assistant superintendent for the Boston Public Schools  “It’s much more rigorous  and there’s a lot of pressure to perform  So any time a student is out — even one day — it’s a major loss  and puts a child behind ”  nThe debate over whether to take kids out of school for travel  family visits  or to take advantage of better pricing and more convenient schedules is a hot topic  Some parents and teachers say that lengthening a school vacation week by a day or so either prior to the week or after is perhaps not such a big deal — typically children will  after all  have unscheduled interruptions in their school year due to snow days or illness    But others  like Brooks  say that even a single unnecessary day is too much  and regardless of the length of time involved or whether the absence is around a scheduled break most of the issues remain the same      “We’re teaching critical thinking  problem solving  understanding and applying concepts ’’ Brooks said  “Parents may think that their kids are young  they’ll catch up  they’re not missing that much  but indeed they are ”    Educators also warn that unlike illness and medical emergencies  absences for travel are typically considered unexcused  and most schools have strict policies on the number of unexcused absences a child is allowed before jeopardizing his or her standing in the school    Parents who have pulled their children out of school for trips are not deaf to those arguments  But  added to the practical considerations of cost and scheduling  they say the opportunity to see different places  experience new things  and spend quality family time justifies a few unexcused absences  “It shouldn’t be a regular occurrence to pull your child out of school for a family trip  but it can be a great tool ” says Deborah Davis  mother of a 7 year old daughter from North Grafton  “If kids are only taught that learning occurs in a classroom  behind a desk with a teacher at the front telling them what to do  it can ultimately limit what they consider learning  We shouldn’t be learning for school  we should be learning for life ’’  Bob Waite  father of three from Brookline  N H   has taken his children out of school to historic destinations around the country  “My kids describe the history and events they saw in each vacation to this day ’’ he said  “The great history of this country can’t be learned in its full effect without visiting the people and places ” Nancy Bergeron from North Andover took her daughter out of school for a “big trip” to Namibia and Botswana  but acknowledges that not all travel warrants truancy  “We are all for extended family vacations ” she says  “But I don’t think ski trips or a routine warm escape really justify a week or more off  The trip should have some real educational benefit ”Other parents cite the need for family time  especially today when schedules are jampacked  distractions are plentiful  and family members are often far flung  “I removed my kids from days at school so they could spend time with relatives who have since passed away ’’ says Robin Falzone  mother of three daughters from Manchester by the Sea  “Life is full of many lessons  not just those taught in the classroom ” All agree that travel can yield invaluable benefits  but those must be balanced against the costs that come with unexcused absences   Family experts and teachers warn that missing school can place unhealthy stress on a child  for some students trying to catch up on work  while their peers are moving ahead  can be difficult — particularly as students grow older and the workload becomes heavier and more complex   “Parents need to ask how it will affect the child academically  socially  and emotionally  and how will the child deal with the stress of catching up on the work and missing school ” advises Karen Ruskin  marriage and family therapist and psychotherapist from Sharon  “You need to consider all other options  not just what is convenient or easier for you as a parent  Ask yourself why you’re considering taking your kids out of their routine  recognizing that routine is very important for the mental and physical wellness of children  Kids do best with structure  routine  consistency  and clear messaging ”  Many parents  even those who have taken their children out of school for travel  point out that playing hooky can send a mi  message about the importance of attendance   “We’ve taken our kids out of school in the past ” says a mother of two from Boston  “Our son didn’t understand why it was OK to skip school for Disney World  but it wasn’t OK to stay home to play in the yard  It’s tough to justify ”Stephanie Cottrell  a mother of two from Lee  N H   agrees  “When you pull your kids from school the message being sent is that rules don’t apply to them ” If you’re considering taking your kids out of class  teachers and family experts offer the follow guidelines  Know your school policy  make sure there are no other options  consider the student’s age  academic standing and ability to make up work  the length of absence  and the timing of the trip  will your child be missing important tests  team sign ups  important events    and try to add some educational benefit to their time away from school     “Any trip can be made into an educational trip with some extra work ” says a first grade teacher in the Boston Public School district  “A few years ago  a child took a trip to Italy and blogged and did FaceTime with her class while she was there — and kept up with class work  The time away from school was a learning experience for her and the class ’’Finally  consult with teachers and school officials ahead of time  “I never took my kids out of school for a family trip  but as a teacher I understood that there were times that parents did for good reasons ” says Joanne Pickul Harder from Topsfield  “That said  I always appreciated advance notice so that kids could meet with me ahead of time and keep up with their assignments so they wouldn’t return to school with lots of makeup work ”  Warning  While some teachers are happy to develop study plans and worksheets for their traveling students  it’s not always the case  Some schools prohibit teachers from providing lessons for unexcused absences  It also can place undue and unfair pressure on already harried and time stressed educators “Extended travel is happening more and more in our school district ” Kathleen Frank Young  mother of two and a New Hampshire public school teacher  says  “As a teacher I’m sometimes frustrated when parents take their children out of school and expect us to customize their children’s instruction so they don’t fall behind or fail to meet state standards ”In the end  it’s parental choice  but it’s clear that the question is fraught “We took our kids out of school to go to Disney in October  The sole reason being that it was less expensive and less crowded ” said Meme Kielbasa  a parent and former teacher from Rhode Island  “That said  while I’m guilty  I don’t justify it ”', '2014_1215')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no

group  the Almighty RSO  He later teamed up with David Mays  a Harvard graduate  who became his manager  The two started The Source  a hip hop magazine that began publishing in 1988  and later put together Hip Hop Weekly  according to Globe reports Throughout Benzino’s hip hop career  he has had highly publicized disputes with popular rap icon Eminem    nBenzino also stars in the VH1 show “Love   Hip Hop  Atlanta ” and hosts a weekly radio show “Zino After Dark” in Atlanta  according to his biography page on VH1’s website  While he had an active career in hip hop  relations within his family appeared tense “There has been growing family tension between Raymond Scott and Gai Scott ” said the statement from the district attorney’s office  According to the priest at the Plymouth church where the procession was heading  the funeral was for Mary Scott of Dorchester  who is listed as Raymond Scott’s mother in her obituary  Just before noon  as Gai Scott and Raymond Scott were traveling side

Friends of Boston Homeless  Others are squeezing into other at capacity facilities  or sleeping on cots and floors in makeshift shelters  They have all become the subjects of bitter debate as the city decides what to do with them On Wednesday  the city  which appears to have been taken by surprise by the local opposition  backed off plans to turn the former Radius hospital in Roxbury into a facility that would have served Kathy  Bonnie  and 200 others “We heard from the neighborhood ” said Walsh spokeswoman Kate Norton  “We are going to go in a different direction ”Project SOAR  the women’s program  may now end up in a former city treatment facility in Mattapan  But in the fiasco that is the Long Island bridge closing  nothing is certain The irony is  when Kathy and Bonnie were

everything from her  including her daughter  who eventually began using  too  Bonnie isn’t allowed to see her two young daughters  Faithful only to their addictions for years  they know they’ve hurt a

have been off drugs for this long before  Every day is almost impossible “We’re wicked pray ers ” Kathy said  “Both of us get down on our knees ”Maybe if people opposed to the Radius plan could see

their own neighborhoods  The city s clumsy handling of the crisis hasn’t helped The bridge closing is forcing the city to confront the limits of its compassion  So far  we’ve learned it’s way easier to care about people like Kathy and Bonnie when they’re living on an island in the middle of the harbor And  in a way  being out there was easier for them  too “Sitting there at night  it’s so peaceful ” Bonnie said  “There were so many times I wanted to leave  but I’d sit on the pier and think about the consequences  There’s a serenity out there ”At night  Kathy would go outside to pray

antagonized some of his officers  but the overwhelming majority were intent only on making sure their voices were heard  t n“Unfortunately  there are some who are throwing swears at us  they are up in

assures that their personal criminal histories will not be affected  attorneys said Two of the protesters  identified by Conley’s office as 31 year old Edward Summerhill and 29 year old Addis

Reggie Kennedy was not walking through the actual United States Senate  but a scale replica of the chamber that is being built on Columbia Point in Dorchester  nWith its ornate domed ceiling  decorative gold wallpaper  and Latin mottos etched on the walls  the replica of the historic chamber will be the centerpiece of The Edward M  Kennedy Institute for the United States Senate  an educational center and tribute to the legendary Massachusetts Democrat that is slated to open to the public in March 2015 On Tuesday  Kennedy  the senator’s widow  donned a blue hard hat and showed off the  chamber  as well as the rest of the 65 000 square foot building  which she said will be packed with interactive exhibits about the Senate’s history  the legislative process  and her husband’s 47 year career  For her  it was an emotional tour “If this doesn’t give you goose bumps  I don’t know what does ” she said  as she entered the soaring chamber  which was littered with scaffolding  ladders  and a wheelbarrow  “I half want to see the press up there because that’s their spot ” she said  gazing up at a second floor balcony The senator  who was 77 when he died of brain cancer in 2009  envisioned the institute as a way to teach the public about the Senate  the importance of which he felt had been overshadowed by the many presidential libraries built across the country  Kennedy said Located next to the John F  Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum  the institute is designed to use technology to illimunate the musty traditions of the Senate for schoolchildren  tourists  and history buffs  Visitors will be given Google handheld devices that will guide them through exhibits about how a bill becomes a law and historic milestones in health care  immigration  and civil rights  particular areas of interest for the late senator   n nClassrooms will convert into caucus rooms  hearing rooms  and cloakrooms  allowing visitors  to try their hand at wheedling  cajoling  and horse trading Every day  there will be a vote on an issue  with visitors debating and then voting at one of the 100 desks in the chamber  “That’s a pretty powerful thing  to feel that you are  for that moment  a United States senator and you can cast that vote ” Kennedy said  As she walked through the nearly $80 million institute  designed by Rafael Viñoly  she pointed to a room that she called “our Teddy space ” She said it would house a re creation of the senator’s Washington office  with his sofa  desk  and memorabilia  “This is something he never envisioned  never thought of  never planned for ” Kennedy said  “But when we took down his office  we thought  ‘Oh gosh  it’s too rich and beautiful and wonderful not to preserve ’ u2009”Institute officials said they have not set the price of admission yet  While most exhibits will focus on the 2 000 men and women who have served in the Senate  some will also highlight activists who have inspired legislative and social change  Kennedy said

Roxbury District Court judge freed accused rapist Ashton Davis from jail over the objections of prosecutors  police say Davis raped and robbed a college student studying in the Arnold Arboretum on Wednesday morning — while he was still wearing his court mandated GPS bracelet  nOn Friday  Davis pleaded not guilty in West Roxbury District Court to charges of aggravated rape and armed robbery in the Wednesday assault  His bail was revoked in the earlier Roxbury case  and he was held on $50 000 cash bail in the arboretum attack   n“These charges are very significant ” Assistant District Attorney Kristina Kerwin said during Davis’s arraignment  “I would suggest that this defendant  with the capacity to commit this type of crime  truly is a danger to anyone out in society ”Davis  23  of Roxbury  stood with a black jacket pulled over his head throughout the court proceeding  His lawyer  Thomas Karp  said his client denied the most recent charges and asserted that the Commonwealth did not appear to have probable cause in either case Prosecutors say Davis came at the young woman from behind with a knife  demanded her bag   and then assaulted her  telling her the attack could happen “in the woods or         right here ”  She told police she waited about 12 hours to call 911 because she was scared and did not know if she wanted to report the attack Boston Police Commissioner William Evans said Friday he was upset that a man investigators worked hard to catch once was so quickly freed and able to prey on a woman enjoying a sunny day in the park “This poor girl’s life will be forever changed ” said Evans  nDavis was first arrested in February after police responded to a radio call for a rape in progress and arrived at Amory Street and Columbus Avenue to find a half naked woman crying in a field  The woman told police she had been held down and raped by two men — one of whom she later identified in a photo array as Davis  according to court documents  The second man has not been identified  according to authorities Davis pleaded not guilty and was held on $25 000 cash bail  said Suffolk District Attorney spokesman Jake Wark  nHe was released  according to Wark  while investigators were still gathering witness statements and phone records  and criminalists were testing physical evidence and expediting DNA analysis in order to obtain grand jury indictments so the case could be moved to Superior Court  While waiting for the indictment  Davis’s defense lawyer  Aaron Lazar  in that case twice moved for bail reduction hearings and prosecutors twice objected  according to court documents  The first time  in March  Judge David Poole denied the request  But the second time  on April 29  Judge Lisa Grant allowed it  releasing Davis on personal recognizance and requiring him to wear a GPS bracelet and undergo a mental health evaluation Prosecutors argued against his release “We opposed any reduction in bail that early in the case while the investigation was so active ” Wark said  “The facts of the case suggested a violent sexual assault by a stranger  That’s one of the most dangerous offenses we encounter as prosecutors ”Evans said that too often  alleged offenders quickly wind up back on the streets “I don’t necessarily blame the judges  Maybe it’s overcrowding  maybe there’s other issues ” he said  “But I know  from a law enforcement standpoint  it’s very frustrating for my officers who work hard and put their lives in danger every day  only to see these kids back out in a couple days ”A Trial Court spokeswoman said the Code of Judicial Conduct prohibits judges from publicly commenting on pending cases  Lazar did not respond to calls for comment  What the prosecutor described on Friday as a “horrifying” attack began at 11 a m  Wednesday  a little less than two months after Davis’s release According to Kerwin  the woman walked down a dirt path in the Arboretum  near a park entrance close to the Forest Hills MBTA station  to find a spot to study before her class Davis approached her  Kerwin said  threatened her with a kitchen knife  and took her cellphone  $10  and a CharlieCard  Then  still pointing the knife at her  he demanded sex Davis then sexually assaulted her  said Kerwin  and threatened her not to tell anyone  before fleeing on his bicycle Evans said investigators conducted interviews  viewed footage from area cameras  and examined physical evidence On Thursday  investigators downloaded data from Davis’s GPS bracelet  which brought the case together  Evans said  when it indicated he was in the area when the assault occurred “The totality of the evidence pointed to one suspect ” said Evans  who declined to talk more specifically about what evidence police have  On Thursday  the victim picked Davis’s photograph out of an array and said it may be her attacker  Kerwin said In court on Friday  Davis’s lawyer said the identification was weak  “The fact that she said it ‘may be’ my client is not probable cause ” Karp said  He also questioned the accuracy of the GPS technology  Davis  he said  has no convictions on his record  is a high school graduate  and a longtime Boston resident  “He indicates in no uncertain terms that he denies these allegations ” Karp said After the arraignment  two women who described themselves as family friends of Davis said he struggles with bipolar disorder and has not been taking his medication  but that he had not been acting unusual  “He just helped me move some furniture Thursday ” said Lilly Johnson  who said she met Davis at The Home for Little Wanderers Aalilyah Nathan  17  said that on Wednesday morning  Davis was angry and left to ride his bicycle as he usually did to calm down  “He came back fine ” said Nathan  “He didn’t say anything  He just came back happy ”Davis is due back in Roxbury District Court on July 29', '2014_1225')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no

descended en masse on transportation headquarters Tuesday to finally sign up for bus routes  giving school officials hope that buses will run more smoothly for the first day of classes next week Nearly 300 drivers out of roughly 650 showed up at the Freeport yard in Dorchester to select which of the hundreds of routes they most prefer to drive — a three day bidding process that was supposed to unfold last week  but did not because drivers refused to take part  school officials said  t nThe collapse of the bidding process last week has created widespread problems this week in getting thousands of students to approximately three dozen charter schools and special education programs that started classes early Just hours before the new bidding process began Tuesday  school transportation officials had been scrambling to cover the morning’s routes  an effort that included last minute consolidations of routes and tapping supervisors to get behind the wheel  Some buses ended up arriving at schools more than an hour late  sometimes with no students on board because families gave up waiting School officials are hoping that Wednesday morning’s bus runs will go more smoothly  and early indications pointed in that direction  As of 9 15 p m   all but 15 of 181 routes had drivers lined up — far better than previous days Mayor Martin J  Walsh characterized the situation as “very fluid” and “frustrating ” but added  “I feel like we are in a better place now ” He said union leadership has assured the School Department drivers have no plans to strike next week  But he added the city is talking about creating contingency plans just in case a problem surfaces “I don’t intend to let anyone shut down the school system next week because we don’t have transportation for kids ” Walsh said in an interview The bus drivers  who staged a surprise one day work stoppage last year that left thousands of students stranded  have been working without a contract since June  Although they drive city owned buses  they are employed by Transdev  an Illinois based company that oversees the city’s four bus yards and previously went by the name Veolia Negotiations with Transdev have centered on a variety of proposals that union officials object to  such as mandating uniforms  introducing new language on absenteeism and tardiness  and allowing the company to hold hearings on the status of employees who have been on extended sick leave But the talks have also been marked by a quest among some union members to win back the jobs of four union leaders who were fired for orchestrating last year’s work stoppage and remain on the negotiating team Dumond Louis  president of the school bus drivers’ union  said he could not comment Tuesday because he was “ nextremely busy” trying to help line up drivers for the runs  He also has been driving routes Michael O’Neill  chairman of the Boston School Committee  called the late buses “extremely frustrating ”“We are thankful for the drivers honoring the call for duty  but there is dissension in the ranks of the union ” he said  “That’s an extremely difficult situation ” In an effort to ensure a bus covered every stop Tuesday morning  transportation officials had to consolidate 175 routes into 140 to get 3 500 students to school  Yet at dawn they still confronted a bleak situation  Dozens of routes remained uncovered  and they struggled to secure additional drivers  By 7 a m   with 20 routes still uncovered  transportation officials began to frantically give supervisors driving assignments  Overall  about a third of the students were assigned to buses that ultimately arrived late  Some buses completed their routes without picking up a single student  as frustrated families had given up waiting One of the eight buses destined to Boston Collegiate Charter School arrived late with no students on board  said Shannah Varon  the school’s executive director and chairwoman of the Boston Charter School Alliance  “We are very disappointed and worried about our kids ” said Varon  noting that several other charter schools also had late buses  “It’s unfortunate that drivers are not showing up ”She said parents have been going to great lengths to get their children to school on time  One mother on Monday  she said  brought her daughter to school by taxi  traveling from one end of Dorchester to the other  adding that “she must have spent a fortune ”In spite of the problems  Varon said charter school leaders appreciated the School Department was “working around the clock” to fix the routes  Lee McGuire  a School Department spokesman  said both school and company officials are pleased progress is being made in getting routes covered this week and the bidding process opened Tuesday with a strong turnout  He said some union leaders also have been working tirelessly to remedy the problems But McGuire added  “What’s important is for parents to be able to count on the school buses every day and we are not there yet ” n', '2014_1231')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article',

would not take part in the event Walsh said he was “disappointed” and felt a “little bit of frustration ” n“I think for the most part everyone was on the same page  We had an agreement  Everything was all set  It came down to what letters were on a banner  which was very unfortunate ” said Walsh  referring to a proposed banner bearing the letters “LGBTQ” on it For two decades  gay men and lesbians have been excluded from openly marching  Walsh worked until the last minute to bring the statewide gay rights organization MassEquality and parade organizers from the Allied War Veterans Council to an agreement that would have changed that  nThe talks broke down over a matter of language  Parade organizers would not permit any signs or clothing bearing the word “gay” or any other declaration of sexual orientation  MassEquality would not march without those words  comparing the restriction to a return to the “closet” of concealing one’s identity Walsh said today that the issue “came down to five letters” on the LGBTQ  standing for Lesbian  Gay  Bisexual  Transgender  and Queer  banner In a statement this morning praising Walsh for his efforts and for choosing not to march  Kara Coredini  executive director of MassEquality  said such a restriction was unfair “No other group is asked to march without a banner and their standard   not the police  firefighters  or the Irish ” Coredini said  “A double standard is the status quo and does not represent progress ”Coredini said activists were encouraged by the progress that was achieved and hoped that the exclusion would end for next year “While we are disappointed that we did not get to march this year as we had hoped  we thank the mayor for championing full inclusion all the way until the end ” she said  “We are encouraged by today’s small step forward with the inclusion of a ‘diversity’ float  and we hope that it is a sign that next year applications from LGBT groups  like MassEquality  that wish to join the celebration of Irish heritage and the service and sacrifice of veterans  will be accepted on their own merits and the decades long ban can finally be lifted ”The Catholic Action League issued a statement after the parade congratulating the parade organizers “for their determined defense of their Faith  moral principles  and constitutional rights ”“The homosexual group which tried to force its way into the parade cared nothing for Saint Patrick or Irish culture  and had nothing but contempt for the Catholic religion  MassEquality wanted to use the parade to promote its own agenda ” the League said in a statement In a statement issued this morning  Walsh drew parallels between the fight for lesbian  gay  bisexual  and transgender equality and earlier battles for liberty “The St  Patrick’s Day parade was born out of the celebration of Evacuation Day  a day set aside to recognize and honor our military and those brave Americans who have banded together for the sake of freedom  And so much of our Irish history has been shaped by the fight against oppression ” Walsh said Interviewed after the Dorchester event  Walsh praised the diversity float that rolled down the parade route today  with gay marchers who were not marching as part of a gay organization but as South Boston residents “That’s a huge step ” Walsh said Like Coredini  he sounded an optimistic note about the controversy  saying  “This time next year we won’t be having this discussion ”Asked about his plans for the day  Walsh  who lives in the city’s Dorchester neighborhood  said he would have a quieter day now that he had decided not to participate in the parade “I’m going to find some corned beef and cabbage in a little while with some family and eat it  I’ll have to do a different walk now to get my five miles in  So maybe I’ll walk around the neighborhood a little bit and get my own single man march on ” he said', '2014_64')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no

notable for its sheer size  some 300 000 demonstrators  Also impressive  though  was the diversity of its participants  in terms not only of race but also of age  religion  and even economic status  Policy makers in the United States and elsewhere won’t take stronger action against climate change without strong public demand  The New York City demonstration highlighted where the political will must come from  the grass roots As the United Nations’ climate change summit convened last month   that government leaders have met numerous times to address climate change threats with little to no result  “Relying on national governments alone to deliver results is not enough  as the last two decades have shown ” he writes  Despite commitments from countries to reduce global carbon dioxide emissions    The dire consequences are coming into view  a UN environmental panel found that global warming has brought “a higher risk of flooding and changes to crop yields and water availability ” Still  no action at the top  n t nThe march served as a platform to showcase the high level of climate activism brimming in local communities  From Massachusetts  hundreds of activists from nonprofits like Neighbor to Neighbor  Clean Water Action  and Fossil Free Somerville  among many others  attended Sunday’s march  From Boston alone  there were at least 22 full buses traveling to Manhattan in an effort put together by community groups like the Better Future Project 350MA and the Roxbury Environmental Empowerment Project  which actually chartered six buses full of minority youth activists to the rally  The presence of all these groups underscored the breadth of concern that exists about climate change  China  the US  and India are the world’s largest carbon polluters  But the two Asian countries were noticeably absent from the UN’s summit   that his country’s carbon dioxide emissions would likely keep rising for the next 30 years  To sidestep the deadlock and bring these two nations

police process for investigating shootings by officers  “Police shootings receive more scrutiny than any other investigation ” he said  “We try to cover every single aspect  from questioning

using to depict my son as this bad person ” she said  “My son stood with his hands in the air ”As Sheffield spoke her voice grew louder  “An 8 year old girl heard my son saying  ‘no don’t shoot  don’t shoot ’” she said  “The police officer shot my son ”Conley urged residents to visit his office’s   “Read I handed down ” he said  “That’ll lay out the facts and circumstances as we found them  and you make your own conclusions ”The Rev  Jeffrey Brown  associate pastor at Twelfth Baptist  said the meeting ended peacefully  with those in the audience offering suggestions for law enforcement officials

repeated violations at the facility Marisol Rondon Ramos  who has been licensed to operate a day care since 2006  has been cited three times by the Department of Early Education and Care for enrolling too many children in her program and four times for noncompliance with safe sleep practices  according to the state  nRelatives said toddler Daylan Walker was at Rondon Ramos’s day care on Wednesday when he fell from the roof of 129 135 Columbia Road  Police said the boy was found on the pavement behind the building just before 10 a m  and taken to Boston Medical Center  where he was pronounced dead “He was a very good boy ” said Laura Lara  17  a family friend who used to baby sit for Daylan  “It’s just hard to accept the fact that he’s gone ”His mother  Leonela Rivera  recently graduated from college  Lara said  and had found a job at a chiropractor s office  At first  Lara said  Rivera brought Daylan to work  but put the boy in day care about 2½ weeks ago because her boss told her she could not bring him anymore Reports released by the state show Rondon Ramos complied with regulators’ demands to correct problems found at her program between December 2009 and January 2013  No one answered the phone Thursday at her residence  and security guards kept nonresidents away from the property “The Department of Early Education and Care continues to investigate this tragedy in close coordination with law enforcement and the Department of Children and Families ” the agency said in a statement  “Our hearts and prayers are with Daylan’s family as they grieve this unimaginable loss ” nAfter her most recent citation for overenrollment and noncompliance with safe sleep practices in November 2013  the state restricted Rondon Ramos’s license so that she could not care for children under 15 months  and the number of children she could care for was reduced to six  the agency said Regulators also investigated allegations of child abuse against Rondon Ramos in June 2012 and January 2013  but did not find evidence to support the claims  the state said  In the June 2012 incident  a parent who made the abuse accusation continued to enroll the child in the program  state officials said The sleep related concerns regulators raised with Rondon Ramos included letting children sleep in bouncers  letting them sleep in a hallway that was too dark  and letting children sleep in a room that was not approved  state records show In a 2013 letter to Rondon Ramos  the state wrote that she continued to let children sleep in bouncer seats after she said she would stop the practice In another letter dated Feb  4  the state said it met with Rondon Ramos to discuss overenrollment and sleep issues The letter said Rondon Ramos told regulators that she would reduce the number of children she cared for to six on condition that none of them would be younger than 15 months Investigators are reviewing surveillance footage to establish a timeline of what happened when Daylan Walker nwent missing  Boston police said A spokesman for Suffolk District Attorney Daniel F  Conley said no charges have been sought in connection with the child’s death A law enforcement official briefed on the investigation  said Daylan had been missing for possibly 20 minutes before he was found on the ground outside the building around 10 a m  by a woman who lives on the first floor The official said people from the day care center had searched for the boy outside the building  looking on the street and at a nearby Burger King “They did not know he went upstairs ” said the official  who asked for anonymity because of the sensitivity of the investigation Councilor Tito Jackson said he was told the boy had been seen playing in the hallway “We can at this point surmise that this young man for some period of time was unattended ” Jackson said in a telephone interview Thursday afternoon “The question I have is why  how long  and literally how could this happen in a day care setting ”Daylan’s uncle  Carlos Abel  said Rondon Ramos’s son greeted the boy when he arrived at day care Wednesday “Fifteen minutes later we get a call from police saying the boy is dead ” said Abel  speaking in Spanish City inspectors visited the property Wednesday afternoon after the death and issued a citation because the door leading to the roof did not close properly  said William Christopher  commissioner of the Inspectional Services Department The battery operated alarm triggered by pushing the door open with its crash bar was also not functioning  but that did not constitute a violation  Christopher said He added that inspectors do not know whether the door was open when Daylan reached the roof Chrystal Kornegay  the chief executive and president of Urban Edge  which owns the property as part of a partnership with the Theroch Tenants Association  said she has not been informed of the citation The apartment complex comprises 191 units  which are paid for by rental subsidies provided by the Department of Housing and Urban Development Kornegay said she has not been made aware of any inspection issues at the property  which is managed by Winn Cos “If there were real issues  I would be aware ” Kornegay said Chanelia Dorest  who lives on the fourth floor of the building  said she has only seen maintenance staff use the door to the roof “That door was always closed ” Dorest said in a telephone interview She estimated that there are close to 70 stairs leading up to the fourth floor and then another set of steps to climb to get to the roof “I get tired by the time I make it to the third floor ” Dorest said  “The kid had to get all the way up those stairs and push the door open  That’s crazy ”Daylan lived with his mother in a Dorchester apartment building on Blue Hill Avenue Lara  the family friend  recalled that the last time she saw the boy he was playing with the toy trucks he adored  He used to race them up and down her arms shouting “Look  look ” she said Daylan  was just learning to talk and loved dogs and playing with trucks  she said  He had mastered his ABC’s  counting to 30  and the names of the people he loved the most  Mami  Papi  Abuela  Uncle At the building where the day care center is housed  many began leaving candles  stuffed animals  balloons  and a toy car in his memory on Thursday “It’s horrible ” Evelyn Cartwright  69  said Thursday afternoon  sitting on her front porch across the street from where the boy fell “I don’t understand how a child his age could walk from the first floor to the roof and get out there ’’ said Cartwright  “It’s almost impossible ”Relatives and friends said she was so overcome by grief that she needed medical help at an undisclosed hospital Thursday night  mourners and supporters went to the makeshift memorial that grew rapidly on a fence outside the day care building in remembrance of the boy Some members of the boy’s family arrived  and his uncle addressed the crowd in Spanish as many attendees cried and embraced Miguel Diaz  25  brought his 1 year old niece  Anayla  to pay their respects They added two candles and some toys to the memorial on Strathcona Road   n“It’s a tragedy ” said Diaz  “It’s a sad day for the family  Hopefully they are all right ”The Rev  William Dickerson with the Greater Love Tabernacle Church in Dorchester said a brief prayer   n“Lord  we know the innocence of a child causes him to be with you ” said Dickerson  “Father  we pray that you strengthen his family  strengthen this community in the midst of this terrible loss

Color Purple’’ ventures into exceptionally grim territory Yet if “The Color Purple’’ explores the depths of human cruelty  the musical adaptation of Alice Walker’s novel and the film version also strives — sometimes strains — to take us to the heights and show us the resiliency of the human spirit  That’s an ambitious undertaking  especially when the tale spans nearly four decades  and the effort is sometimes palpable at SpeakEasy Stage Company  After an eventful and taut Act 1  the narrative line of Marsha Norman’s book grows diffuse in Act 2 But overall this adds up to a stirring production  With Paul Daigneault bringing his customary vitality and dexterity to the challenge of directing a cast of 20  “The Color Purple’’ taps into the enduring power of Walker’s story about a woman in rural Georgia who undergoes systematically dehumanizing treatment  yet somehow emerges with her identity and her spirit intact That woman is Celie  portrayed at SpeakEasy by Roxbury native Lovely Hoffman  a rhythm and blues performer who is at her most expressive when she is singing the songs crafted by Brenda Russell  Allee Willis  and Stephen Bray  Initially  Hoffman’s Celie fixes her gaze on the ground  as if she’d like to sink into the dirt — and indeed that’s exactly how she’s treated by the men in her life It’s 1909 at the beginning of “The Color Purple ’’ and 14 year old Celie is about to give birth to her second child  having been impregnated by her own stepfather  David Jiles Jr    Viewed as ugly by him and others  she spends her days doing chores and receiving verbal abuse  a harrowing existence brightened only by the loving  playful relationship she enjoys with her sister Nettie  the luminous Aubin Wise  But Celie is torn away from Nettie when her stepfather forces her into marriage with a brutal man she knows only as Mister  his real name is Albert   who is looking less for a wife than for a servant  caretaker for his children  and general doormat  The versatile Maurice Emmanuel Parent  who excelled as the wily Ralph D  in SpeakEasy’s 2012 production of “The  Expletive  With the Hat ’’ is a convincingly heartless Mister  all baleful glare and rigid posture He has a weakness  though  and her name is Shug Avery  Crystin Gilmore brings the necessary force and sensuality to her portrayal of the free spirited Shug  making it clear with  for example  her dynamic performance of the rousing “Push Da Button’’ why Albert can’t shake the spell the singer has cast on him  Gilmore also captures the tenderness of which Shug is capable  manifested in her relationship with Celie  which opens the door of possibility and escape for the latter Valerie Houston excels as Sofia  whose indomitability in the face of would be male oppressors  emphatically underscored in “Hell No  ’’ her signature number  is grievously tested by an encounter with the vicious forces of white racism  Jared Dixon is solid as Harpo  Mister’s good hearted son and Sofia’s husband No theater company in town executes musicals with more brio than SpeakEasy  and musical director Nicholas James Connell is a big reason why  Having worked on the company’s memorable productions of shows as varied as “Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson ’’ “Xanadu ’’ “The Drowsy Chaperone ’’ “In the Heights ’’ and the aforementioned “Next to Normal ’’ Connell delivers again in “The Color Purple ’’ Operating within the Wimberly Theatre rather than SpeakEasy’s usual  and smaller  Roberts Studio Theatre  he brings the gospel  blues  and jazz score to robust life  playing keyboard and conducting four other able musicians  Jason May on reeds  David Neves on trumpet  Zachary Hardy on drums  and Tom Young on guitar and harmonica Set designer Jenna McFarland Lord effectively suggests both the desolation and inextinguishable hope of Celie’s existence with one simple touch that evokes time  place  mood  and circumstance  a large  stark tree  its limbs reaching out  Not everything about this production is as understated  Indeed  “The Color Purple’’ can feel laborious in its determination to deliver a message of self empowerment and a dose of uplift  and you may find the personal transformation of one central character in particular very hard to swallow But you’re not likely to care by the time Hoffman delivers a deeply moving rendition of a song whose two word title makes a statement that amounts to a kind of miracle  all things considered  “I’m Here ’’', '2014_1211')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article',

Neighborhoods  which posited that lower ranking racial or nationality groups would drive out good families and depress neighborhood values  Instructors even provided a hierarchy of races and nationalities for ready reference  English  Germans  and Scandinavians made the best neighbors  Mexicans  blacks  and Southern Italians were at the bottom of the list It’s hard to imagine such a detestable ranking today  Unless  of course  you were to consider the so called “poor door” policy in New York City  In this updated version  developers grab some tax abatements and build a more profitable  denser development than zoning would otherwise allow by agreeing to set aside some units for low income families in deluxe  high rise developments  But to ensure — in the Gresham sense — that bad money does not drive out good  the low income tenants are steered to a separate entrance in the back  In some developments  “rent regulated” tenants — who are more likely to be elderly or minorities — are required to keep their dirty mitts off the gym equipment  sky lounge furniture  and other amenities  t nThe 33 story Extell development project on the Upper West Side of Manhattan is the latest to trot out the poor door policy  Residents of the 219 luxury units are invited to walk through the front entrance  Residents of the 55 affordable units are slated to enter their homes on

Large scale residential developers have the option of setting aside some units for low  and moderate income  families on site  building affordable units off site  or paying into a housing fund  And those developers who choose to marble the affordable units into the wider residential complex manage to do so without launching a class war Over the last decade  several of Boston’s worst public housing developments have been transformed into well appointed  mi  income complexes where people who pay market rents live and play side by side with subsidized families  No one seems to make a big deal out of it  The same holds true for the award winning Harbor Point in Dorchester  a former public housing project that found new life as a private  mi  income development  Everyone into the pool Mi  income developments are becoming a normal part of the urban landscape  City dwellers  by and large  enjoy living in economically diverse neighborhoods  Developers who pursue poor door policies are

George H  W  Bush’s 1992 reelection campaign  But on Sunday  Bush aides and members of the Kennedy family came together to celebrate the former president’s willingness to buck party orthodoxy and reach across the aisle  qualities they said are sorely lacking in today’s Washington  t nBush was given the John F  Kennedy “Profile in Courage Award ” for his support of the deal that cost him politically but has been credited with laying the foundation for the surpluses that followed when President Clinton took office Bush’s granddaughter  Lauren Bush Lauren  accepted the award on behalf of the 89 year old former president  in a ceremony that former White House aides described as a mild salve for the rebuke Bush was dealt in the 1992 election “George Bush did the right thing for the country  and it’s nice to see people are beginning to appreciate it ” John H  Sununu  who was Bush’s chief of staff  said at the ceremony at the John F  Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum in Dorchester  nAndrew H  Card Jr   who was deputy chief of staff  said the former president’s willingness to break his no new taxes pledge should serve as a beacon for current members of Congress who refuse to negotiate “We have to be careful with absolutes ” Card said  “People who are stuck with an absolute view of the world fail to recognize certain realities in the world  We want our government to work well ” t nJack Schlossberg  President Kennedy’s grandson  presented the award to Lauren  “America’s gain was President Bush’s loss ” Schlossberg said  “and his decision to put country above party and political prospects make him an example of a modern profile in courage that is all too rare ” Bush made his “Read my lips” pledge during the 1988 campaign  believing the economy would improve  Sununu said  But after taking office  the economy worsened and forecasters predicted the federal deficit could double In 1990  Bush reached an agreement with congressional Democrats on a budget that raised taxes while setting limits on spending  The deal aimed to cut the deficit by about $500 billion over five years  Bush knew he would be pilloried for breaking his promise  but “realized he had to do the right thing  and he took the political hit ” Sununu said  “Candidly speaking  my grandfather didn’t want to raise taxes in 1990  but in our constitutional  system of governance Congress also gets a say — and besides that  he felt he owed the American people action and results ” Lauren said Olympia Snowe  the former Republican senator from Maine who was serving in the US House at the time  voted against the deal  She was facing a tough reelection campaign  and was opposed to the tax increases  she said Still  Snowe said  the bipartisan deal should be a model for a deeply polarized and paralyzed Congress that seems to lurch from crisis to crisis “It’s tragic for the country when you consider how little has been accomplished because of their unwillingness to work together and build consensus on key questions ” Snowe said  “This is a moment to understand how it can work ”Sununu had a different take  He said President Obama should draw a lesson from Bush’s willingness to negotiate with members of the opposite party  “This proves that a president has to lead in order to get bipartisanship  and all this concern that it’s Congress that is holding it back is wrong ” he said  “It is a president who has to lead  That’s why a president is getting the award ”Lauren read a statement from her grandfather thanking the Kennedy Library for the honor “At age 89 and 7 8  let me assure you kind words really do matter ” Bush’s message said  “Thank you again for remembering what our team tried to do  lo  those many years ago ”', '2014_329')","('no

councilors on Thursday blasted Radius Specialty Hospital for shutting down its Roxbury and Quincy rehabilitation facilities  transferring its patients  and laying off nearly 350 workers with little notice Radius workers found themselves out of jobs just about two weeks after the company publicly acknowledged on Sept  23 that it would stop operating  At a City Council hearing on the shutdown  Radius’s lawyer said the company had no choice because it was rapidly running out of cash  But councilors did not buy the explanation  t n“This is a disgrace ” Councilor Ayanna Pressley told laid off workers who attended the hearing  “This is no way to repay people who have been as committed and dedicated as you have been ”The criticisms from the City Council were just the latest of recent troubles for Radius  Steward Health Care  which was leasing space to Radius at the Steward owned Quincy Medical Center  last week sued to collect more than $1 million it says Radius owes in back rent In the lawsuit  Steward said Radius has not paid its full rent for more than a year  Radius disputes the claim Two labor unions  the Massachusetts Nurses Association and Local 1199 of the Service Employees International Union  have also sued Radius  alleging the company failed to give proper notice before shutting its doors  Both unions had members who were laid off by Radius Radius ran a 38 bed facility in Quincy and an 84 bed facility in Roxbury  The Quincy operations  though smaller than Roxbury’s  generated enough money to subsidize the struggling Roxbury site  according to Radius’s lawyer  Stewart F  Grossman Grossman told city councilors that the events that forced the company to shut down were largely out of Radius’s control  He said the problems began Aug  11 when South Shore Hospital in Weymouth stopped referring patients to the Quincy facility Then  when Radius’s bank  Santander  learned of its struggles  the bank recalled Radius’s loans of $16 million and froze an account holding $2 4 million City councilors said that in addition to Santander and South Shore Hospital  Partners HealthCare also shares the blame for Radius’s closing  Partners  which is seeking to acquire South Shore Hospital  operates its own rehabilitation facilities Representatives from South Shore and Partners were invited to testify at the hearing but did not attend  Councilors said they would ask them to testify at a continued hearing next week  They said they would also ask Santander to testify South Shore Hospital’s spokeswoman  Sarah Darcy  said the hospital never stopped referring patients to Radius  “Referrals are based on a patient’s medical need and preference ” she said in an e mail  “Statements that allege that our referral patterns are influenced by our proposed merger are false  South Shore Hospital is not a part of Partners HealthCare ”Partners spokesman Rich Copp said this is “not a Partners HealthCare matter ” but “if the city council wants us to appear next week  we’ll be happy to appear ”Santander declined to comment on Radius  citing privacy rules  but said in a statement  “We are a responsible lender and endeavor to work with customers in the event they have difficulty meeting their obligations to the bank ”Radius’s sudden closing has thrown the lives of its former workers into disarray  the workers told city councilors “The way everything happened was so abrupt ” said Agatha Layne  who worked as a nurse in Roxbury  “We didn’t have time to even think  What about all the workers who have children in college  What are we going to do ”Hillie Sampson  a cook  said he is struggling to find work after 37 years with Radius  “I’m playing catch up ” he said  “It doesn’t make life easy for you  especially when you’re middle aged and you have to go out and find a job  and you’re competing with all these young people ”Grossman apologized to the laid off workers “I really feel terrible for this situation ” he said  “My clients had every

for refusing to testify before a grand jury in connection with Hernandez’s murder case Bristol Superior Court Judge E  Susan Garsh upbraided Tanya Singleton  saying she had openly flouted the law and would have surely faced jail time if she were not afflicted with terminal breast cancer that prison doctors cannot effectively treat  Instead  Garsh sentenced Singleton  who is Hernandez’s cousin  to two years’ probation with one year of home confinement  which the judge said should be enough to persuade her to testify if summoned again   t n“Miss Singleton’s willful conduct constitutes an assault on the rule of law and the effective administration of criminal justice ’’ Garsh said in Bristol Superior Court  “Miss Singleton’s health is the only reason she is not being placed in jail ’’ for her silence  In court Tuesday  Singleton’s lawyer contended that her refusal to testify was borne out of a deep devotion to family “She chose family loyalty and family love over civic duty ” said the lawyer  E  Peter Parker But the mother of a Dorchester man Hernandez is accused of killing last summer said  in an emotional appearance  that Singleton had shown no compassion  Ursula Ward  the mother of Odin L  Lloyd  was denied a chance to give an impact statement in court Tuesday after Garsh ruled she was not a direct victim of Singleton’s contempt  Ward instead spoke haltingly to reporters outside the courthouse  clutching a wrinkled piece of paper and struggling to find words  until her emotions forced her to walk away  t n“What would you do or say to help the other family heal with the truth ” Ward said  “My baby was my only son  my first born  My baby’s gone without me saying goodbye ”Prosecutors never argued that Singleton had a role in Lloyd’s death  but they said she could have provided insight about the actions of Ernest Wallace and Carlos Ortiz  two men accused of aiding Hernandez in the shooting  Specifically  they said  Wallace and Ortiz were at Singleton’s home in Bristol  Conn   before Hernandez allegedly called them to North Attleborough the night Lloyd was killed  and they returned after Lloyd’s body was found in an industrial park in June 2013 Singleton knew about an effort to shuttle Ortiz out of state before he was arrested  prosecutors said  and she allegedly gave Wallace a new cellphone  Authorities also believe Hernandez’s cousin could help explain how Wallace and Ortiz knew the former New England Patriots tight end Hernandez  Wallace  and Ortiz have all pleaded not guilty in the Lloyd case  Hernandez is also facing charges in Suffolk County for allegedly killing two men in Boston after an altercation at a nightclub in 2012  Singleton faces another contempt charge for refusing to speak before a grand jury in that case For the next year  Singleton will only be allowed to leave her Connecticut home for meetings with doctors and attorneys or for court appearances in Massachusetts  Garsh also prohibited her from contacting Hernandez  Wallace  Ortiz  and a number of witnesses in the case  She will have to check in with a probation officer in person once a week Prosecutor William McCauley said Singleton deserved a 2½ year jail term  the maximum sentence for her crime  but said that she would not have received adequate medical treatment while incarcerated  Parker said a doctor determined her cancer is advancing and that she soon will die For this reason  Garsh declined to sentence Singleton to two years’ home confinement  as McCauley requested  There must be “some light for Miss Singleton at the end of the tunnel ” she said If Singleton refuses to testify again  Garsh said  she may face additional home confinement in the future  But if she obeys court orders  she may have time to spend her remaining months with loved ones more freely “In light of her shortened life expectancy  probation with two years of home confinement appears to provide insufficient incentive to reform ” Garsh said Singleton left the courthouse Tuesday clad in a black shirt with a wrap around her head  She walked alongside Parker and did not speak to reporters before hopping in the back seat of a red pickup truck Hernandez  24  was a promising young player for the Patriots before he was arrested last summer  A number of friends and loved ones  including Wallace  Ortiz  and Singleton  have since found themselves caught in the swirl surrounding the athlete’s cases  Hernandez’s former girlfriend  Shayanna Jenkins   They are part of a circle of cohorts who prosecutors say stood alongside the charismatic Patriot even as he

the state’s plan to relocate the Massachusetts Department of Transportation to Roxbury  saying a deal of such cost and complexity should be subject to a more detailed public review Baker did not outright oppose the effort to build a 24 story headquarters for MassDOT near Dudley Square  But he said the proposal  certain to cost hundreds of millions of dollars  is proceeding too quickly  given the enormous implications for Roxbury and downtown Boston  t n“Governor elect Baker believes a project of this magnitude and its impact on the neighborhoods in question warrant greater public input and discussion to ensure it is the best deal for taxpayers ” spokesman Tim Buckley said Details of the plan have come only in recent days  The Boston Redevelopment Authority on Thursday approved a land transfer that would allow MassDOT to move from Park Square to a development site on Tremont Street  across from Boston police headquarters Governor Deval Patrick has been trying to advance the project before his term expires  Officials in his administration said the move is far from a done deal and was always expected to go through a more rigorous public review “We have initiated the first step in what will be a multiple year process of relocating our headquarters  and we look forward to the extensive  authentic  and inclusive public engagement process to come ” said Jeffrey Simon  Patrick’s assistant secretary for real estate and asset development at the Department of Transportation Simon said moving the transportation department headquarters to Roxbury would have a “transformative effect” on that part of the city  The agency has more than 2 000 employees  whose presence would help support new restaurants  stores  and homes in the neighborhood  while construction of the new building would create hundreds of jobs  administration officials said The plans include a 24 story tower with three levels of retail stores and community space  The complex would also contain a 21 000 square foot museum for the National Center for Afro American Artists If approved  it would be a huge boost for a long delayed project called Tremont Crossing  where developers are trying to build a complex on 7 25 acres that would include a BJ’s Wholesale Club  300 residences  and a 200 room hotel Baker has said he generally supports using state resources to spur development in economically struggling parts of the state  But he said Monday that the Roxbury deal has not been adequately vetted  He first raised his concerns during a radio interview Monday morning with the Boston Herald The governor elect  who takes office in January  will have several opportunities to influence or kill the project  Baker will have the authority to appoint new leadership at MassDOT  and his administration will control the agency’s budget as well as any proceeds from real estate sales Negotiations to move MassDOT to Roxbury have been advancing for several months  A measure signed into law by Patrick on Oct  31 signaled the state could be gearing up to sell its downtown property  The law calls for the transfer of ownership from the Division of Capital Asset Management and Maintenance to the Department of Transportation  ensuring the proceeds of the sale could be used to finance the new headquarters in Roxbury The matter did not surface again publicly until the release of last week’s BRA agenda  which described a land swap that would allow MassDOT to construct its tower on city owned property  The BRA’s board approved the deal Thursday night  though it remains uncertain what property the city would get in exchange Though the BRA’s initial approval was a major step forward  a spokesman for the authority said the building’s design and other details of the project are expected to undergo further review “There will still be opportunities for officials at the BRA and the community to weigh in ” spokesman Nick Martin said Cyndi Roy Gonzalez  a MassDOT spokeswoman  said the agency is planning to put the Park Square Transportation Building up for sale early next year  which would open up a big opportunity in the heart of Boston  Emerson College has expressed interest in the building but is expected to face competition from other bidders It would take several years to plan and build a new headquarters in Roxbury  which would house about 2 400

from the Sunset Point Camp walk by their Nantasket Road home  each sporting a camp issued red T shirt  bound for nearby Nantasket Beach The sights and sounds of jubilant campers have been a summer fixture in this seaside community for more than 90 years  However  in 2009  summertime came  but the campers did not  nFaced with drastic budget cuts following the 2008 financial crash  the Sunset Point Camp closed  creating a void in the town and for the hundreds of children who flocked there from all over Greater Boston every year “That was a low point ” said Joe Menice  a retired teacher who is still active in the town’s parks and recreation program  “It was so quiet without the kids next door ”Not to be silenced  a group of local residents formed the Friends of Sunset Point Camp  raising enough money that year to allow the camp to reopen in 2010 and again provide a safe holiday retreat for more than 400 underprivileged city youngsters This year begins yet another new chapter  The camp  which opened in 1919 and is owned by Catholic Charities and considered its crown jewel  has just concluded a nearly $2 million renovation  made possible by a gift received last year from an anonymous family foundation that should ensure it continues to operate for years to come  Construction began in late fall and continued all winter  The final touches were applied this spring “It has not lost the look and feel of a camp that is nearly 100 years old ” Debbie Rambo  president of Catholic Charities  Archdiocese of Boston  said of the refurbished venue  “The new camp facade is just beautiful  It’s located in a neighborhood  and we wanted to keep the same look and feel for the neighbors while modernizing the facility ” nIn addition to the makeover  the donation from the family trust will allow counselors to extend some of the camp’s educational programming  Counselors often teach campers how to swim  help them finish their summer reading  and provide life lessons to help them get along with others  The youngsters will also take part in drama  arts and crafts  and other recreational activities Essentially  the camp is a free  weeklong vacation for at risk and low income children  who are offered programs that promote teamwork  sportsmanship  and good health  The goal is to give them a week away from home and from the difficulties they often endure  without regard for their race  nationality  or religious affiliation  Most campers come from Dorchester  Roxbury  and Mattapan  and  according to Catholic Charities  about 90 percent of the campers are from families living below the poverty line  Nearly 40 000 youths between the ages of 6 and 13 have passed through the camp since it was founded This summer  the first round of campers will arrive on June 27 to enjoy the major upgrades made to the 21 000 square foot facility  Recently  a busload of students from St  Sebastian’s School in Needham took part in a day long cleanup to help prepare the place for the summer The camp sits on 1 5 acres and stays open through mid August  It includes an in ground pool that was added several years ago  a resurfaced basketball court  paddleboats  and kayaks  In the makeover  new siding  a new roof  windows  and new decks were added outside  and the inside of the camp was gutted and rebuilt  Sunset Point Camp now meets ADA requirements and for the first time can welcome children with physical disabilities  nThe main building of the camp had functioned as the old Veterans Hospital on Bumpkin Island  a quick kayak paddle from the camp  and was moved to the camp on a barge in 1919 The camp costs about $250 000 a year to operate  including off season maintenance costs  Since it closed in 2009  the Friends of Sunset Point Camp have raised more than $425 000 in five years  according to Kate Brigham  founder of the fund raising group  An annual clambake at the camp — to be held on Saturday  — is one of its most popular fund raising events Brigham said the financial support has come not just from Hull but also from Scituate  Hingham  Weymouth  and other neighboring towns  “It has really been a South Shore effort ” she said  “The donations come in both small and large  but the real important mission is raising awareness of the camp “The camp is in our own backyard  yet so many people don’t know about it  I just love how simple the camp is and what a gift it is for the kids ”Sunset Point Camp is a gift for the community as well  The sights and sounds of the camp often waft over the bay as a sure sign for Hullonians that summer has indeed arrived  Hundreds of Hull teenagers  and others from nearby towns  have spent summers at the camp as counselors The Menice family moved to their home adjacent to the camp in 1954  Several Menice children have worked as camp counselors  They watched as Cardinal Richard Cushing toured the facility in the 1960s  Cardinal Sean O’Malley has also spent time at the camp “We’ve always enjoyed seeing the kids come in each summer  and we’ve seen the different cardinals come through ” said Menice  a Eucharistic minister at St  Ann’s Church  “It’s a fabulous place ”Liane Bromberg  whose stucco home on Edgewater Road is a stone’s throw from the camp  said she has never had any reservations about living so close to the facility “You hear kids’ voices all day  and it’s really joyful ” she said  “You hear them ringing the bell for meals  and you smell the campfires “It’s so nice that the kids have a safe and friendly place they can come to each summer ”', '2014_967')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no

year  an increase that safety specialists attribute primarily to heightened national awareness of the problem  which prompts more victims to come forward A survey of information from more than two dozen of the largest New England colleges found that reports of “forcible sex offenses” climbed by 40 percent overall between 2012 and 2013  according to a Globe review of data that colleges provided in annual federally mandated reports released last week  n t nLast year  there were a total of 289 reports of the offenses at the colleges  That compares with 206 in 2012  The 2013 total was more than twice as many as reported five years before  nSexual assaults on and around college campuses  long considered a vastly underreported crime  have received increased attention in recent months from the Obama administration  the schools  and students  As a result  campuses have stepped up training  support  and outreach  and the rising number for 2013 is seen as signaling that victims are more comfortable reporting assaults “It means that students are coming forward and reporting crimes that are happening and ending that culture of silence ” said Alison Kiss  director of the Clery Center for Security On Campus  a nonprofit that trains colleges to comply with the federal Clery Act Specialists also believe the spike in reporting may indicate that colleges are becoming more thorough and transparent in collecting and disclosing sexual assault data At all but four of the campuses in the review  the number of sexual assault reports rose or held steady last year Hampshire College said its reports of assaults increased from 13 to 20  giving the school the highest rate of sexual assaults per 1 000 students in 2013 — 13 6 — among colleges surveyed by the Globe The next highest rate was 5 5 assaults at Dartmouth College  the school reported 24 assaults in 2012  and 35 in 2013  The average rate among schools in the survey was 0 99 per 1 000 students in 2013 Diana Fernandez  Hampshire’s coordinator for Title IX  a federal law that mandates gender equality in campus life  attributed the above average rate at the college to its new efforts to inform students about how to report the crime and about the increased resources available for victims  n“It’s continued education and really working with the community on that education and training ” Fernandez said She said Hampshire recently added online training for students on sexual assault prevention  Hampshire has also expanded workshops that teach students about consent and how to intervene if they see a friend in a vulnerable situation “We really look at how can we promote these conversations and how can we work with our students to have these conversations ” she said University of Connecticut saw sexual assault reports nearly double from 13 in 2012 to 25 last year  putting its rate for 2013 at 0 88 per 1 000 students “I think the numbers will continue to rise here and at other campuses for years to come  and that’s really important because it gives us a better picture of what’s happening ” said UConn’s Title IX coordinator  Elizabeth Conklin  nMeanwhile  Amherst College was one of just four schools in the survey that saw sexual assault reports decline  The college reported 14 sexual assaults in both 2010 and 2011  17 offenses in 2012  and nine in 2013  which put its rate for 2013 at 5 04 per 1 000 students Campus spokeswoman Caroline Hanna said in an e mail that the college has taken numerous steps to better prevent and respond to sexual assault and encourages students to report the crime  But  “as these numbers tend to fluctuate across institutions and year over year  it is difficult for us to speculate about the reason for the change in last year’s numbers ” Hanna said Under the Clery Act  colleges are required by Oct  1 each year to issue a report that includes statistics of allegations of crimes that occurred on campus  including dorms and other public property  at property owned by  but separated from  the main campus  and at fraternities and sororities  They exclude other off campus housing An estimated 88 percent of college victims do not formally report sexual assaults  federal studies suggest  Even so  some area schools have reported surprisingly low numbers of assault allegations  given their size Suffolk University  which enrolled 8 800 students last year  said there were no reports of sexual assaults in 2013  Since 2008  the downtown university reported two cases  both in 2010 School spokesman Greg Gatlin said the low numbers may be because fewer than 15 percent of Suffolk students live on campus The university “works closely with students  faculty  and staff to encourage the reporting of any incident and to make our community aware of available resources ” he said in an e mail  nBunker Hill Community College  with an enrollment of about 14 000  listed one report of sexual assault in both 2008 and 2012  and zero reports in the four years in between Spokeswoman Karen Norton said the college is confident its data is accurate  “We have a lot of processes in place about how we gather the information and report it ” Norton said The two year school is different from more traditional colleges  she said  There are no dormitories  two thirds of the students are part time  and about one third take at least some of their classes online  The average age of students is 27  she said Without singling out specific schools  the Clery Center’s Kiss and other experts say that low numbers may indicate colleges are not doing enough to raise awareness about the issue or to educate how victims can report  It may also mean colleges are not being honest or thorough in their reporting  experts said In recent years  numerous colleges have been caught or accused of failing to disclose individual reports of sexual assault or for releasing inaccurate data Under new federal guidelines  colleges were required for the first time in 2013 to also compile and disclose the number of reports of dating violence  domestic violence  and stalking on their campuses  But two local schools failed to include those statistics on their latest Clery reports One school was Roxbury Community College  which acknowledged last year — amid an ongoing federal investigation — that it had underreported crime figures in prior Clery reports  Campus president Valerie Roberson said in an e mail that the college had no reports of domestic violence  dating violence  or stalking for 2013 “As a commuter college  these crimes would be unusual  especially when compared to what might occur at a residential college ” she wrote Wentworth Institute of Technology also failed to include the newly required data After the Globe pointed out the omission  Wentworth spokesman Caleb Cochran said it was an oversight  On Thursday  the school issued an updated report saying it did not receive reports in any of the three categories last year  n',

raisers    the majority of them over 25  make $12 an hour or less As employers squeeze costs  these low wage earners frequently can only get part time work without benefits  some with irregular schedules that make second jobs and child care arrangements difficult  They have no protections from having hours cut and they receive no severance pay if they are let go without warning   t nMany don’t have cars  making it hard to get to work when public transportation isn’t running  Those who have cellphones can’t always afford minutes  so employers struggle to reach them  Few have college degrees For workers in this precarious position  there is a thin line between survival and catastrophe  and one unexpected event — an illness  a rent increase  a layoff — can be devastating Increasingly  they are speaking up — working with union organizers  demonstrating for higher wages  In Massachusetts  the minimum wage will rise to $11 an hour by 2017  the highest in the nation  But for most  it still won’t be enough Here are stories of the working poor  some cobbling together multiple jobs  others trying to advance by improving skills  all struggling to get by  n t nLarry McCain says he started working as an 8 year old  sweeping barbershop floors and running after golf balls in Franklin Park  He went on to earn as much as $19 an hour operating an engraving machine  but then companies began shipping manufacturing overseas and jobs dried up “That’s when the floor fell out ” he said  McCain landed temporary jobs as a groundskeeper and a security guard  making $10 to $12 an hour  but never enough to get back on his feet  He spent one winter sleeping in his Nissan Sentra  sometimes sneaking into buildings to keep warm  In 2012  he got a position at Logan Airport de icing planes  then another cleaning airplane cabins  Last year  for $9 an hour  he started inspecting trays of sandwiches and drinks before they were loaded onto flights  When McCain was moved to a 2 30 a m  shift  when buses don’t run  he had to walk 2½ miles to work  Working 30 hours a week and bringing home about $700 a month  McCain could barely afford his $600 a month room above a jewelry shop in East Boston — a price that includes a discount for cleaning the rooming house’s shared bathrooms  McCain’s 10 by 13 room has a bed  sink  mini fridge  microwave  and dresser with a TV on top  Pictures of Halle Barry  Beyonce  and Barack Obama adorn the walls  After paying his rent  he said  “People buy Starbucks coffee and three gallons of gas with what I have left ” He sometimes gets groceries from a food pantry at a nearby Catholic church — mostly spaghetti sauce and macaroni and cheese — telling them he has two children so he can get more  McCain  52  does have two daughters who live nearby  although they have children of their own  He doesn’t see them much  “I can’t even afford to buy them Christmas gifts ” he said  “I don’t have anything ” Last year  McCain started talking to 32BJ SEIU  the union trying to organize airport workers  He called a federal workplace safety agency to complain that he and fellow workers had no water to drink and no proper gear to wear in the rain  He spoke out about poor working conditions at a Massport board meeting  Last month  without warning  McCain was fired  His employer  G2 Secure Staff  declined to discuss his situation For now  he gets by on $114 a week in unemployment assistance  $100 of which goes to his landlord  He has applied for groundskeeping and construction  jobs  and continues to search  “I don’t care what kind of work it is ” he said  “as long as it’s work ” nStill  Katherine is barely afloat  The 57 year old Dorchester resident asked that her last name not be used because  like many working poor  her situation is fragile  She fears getting fired  and getting in trouble with the Internal Revenue Service for earnings she doesn’t report Last winter  Katherine’s landlord raised the rent on her Roxbury apartment from $1 000 to $1 200  forcing her and her fiancé  a part time janitor  to move into a friend of a friend’s house in Dorchester for $900 a month  When work is plentiful  Katherine chips away at the several thousand dollars she owes for past utility bills and tries to set some money aside  When work is scarce  she gets food stamps and stocks up on canned goods  pasta  and rice from church food pantries  Her daughter in Seattle pays her cellphone bill and sends money when she needs it  “There’s a lot of people that are stuck in the same situation that I am ” Katherine said  “Every other person that I work with in the kitchen has a second job ” Katherine grew up in New Jersey  the third of five children raised by a single mother  Her father was in and out of prison  Katherine married at 18  but she said her husband was abusive  and she fled to Boston   pregnant  with a 1  and 2 year old in tow  She went to night school at Fisher College and earned an associate’s degree in business management  with the help of a neighbor who watched her three daughters for $50 a week  plus a ride to bingo  In 2009  she was hired by the state  making $18 98 an hour to help long lines of unemployed workers file claims  But after undergoing hip replacement surgery  she decided to take a voluntary buyout from the state to give herself more time to recover  She regrets the decision to this day  With help from the Dudley Street Neighborhood Initiative  a nonprofit community development agency  she and her fiancé have set aside $1 100 toward buying a house  They hope to qualify for a rehab loan to buy a property in disrepair or team up with others to buy a multifamily   n“The average person making $10  $11  $12 an hour  you’re robbing Peter to pay Paul ” she said  “If I could make $15  $16 an hour  I could make it happen ”Recently  Katherine was made full time at the food service firm  with a 25 cent raise  She can’t afford the company’s health insurance  so she plans to keep her MassHealth plan — and continue working side jobs to save up for that home  nMichelle Chaudhry  partial to red lipstick  eyeshadow  and sparkly toenails  manages to look elegant even with a baby on one hip and her 8  and 9 year olds nearby  But since December  Chaudhry and her children have lived in an apartment in Hyde Park provided by Heading Home  which shelters homeless families  That’s when Chaudhry  who until recently made $10 an hour as a home health aide  ran out of money and lost her apartment in Danvers  She stopped working after giving birth six months ago  getting by on $300 a month in food stamps  supplemented by trips to the food pantry  She recently enrolled in a free 11 week college prep class  which allows her to stay in shelter housing as she gears up to get a nursing degree  Even when Chaudhry was working  bathing and feeding elderly clients  she brought home less than $200 a week  Her husband  a Pakistani native whom she met while working as a hairdresser on Cape Cod  was deported four years ago  Estranged from her family in Danvers and Wenham  with her husband unable to send money from his job as a security guard in Pakistan  Chaudhry has no support system  “My sister said to me  ‘Oh you’re sucking off the government  I’m working all day  you’re getting food stamps ’ ” she said  “Basically I’m out here floating on the boat by myself ”Before the baby was born — conceived during a trip to Pakistan last year  paid for by the sale of her husband’s family home in Pakistan — Chaudhry could only work when her children were in school  This limited her ability to work as a hairdresser  which required evening and weekend hours  She still owes $9 500 in student loans for cosmetology school “Because I’m a single mother  I’m stuck in a box ” she said  “You’re trying to climb out of the box  but you’re slammed back into it ” As much as she loves her husband  Chaudhry is just about ready to give up on their relationship  There’s little chance he’ll be allowed back in the United States  she said  and she doesn’t want to move there  “I’m better being poor in America than being poor in Pakistan ” she said To get by  Chaudhry relies on what she calls her “inner champion ” She has had to do things she’s ashamed of  like driving her rusting Chrysler minivan with no insurance and sneaking to the Goodwill donation box during the night to take clothes for her children  “You always put the smile on and act like these things aren’t happening to you ” she said  “But they are  And they’re crushing ”  nWileidy Ortiz dropped out of high school

the Jeremiah E  Burke High School in Dorchester  then quitting altogether during her junior year She enrolled in Job Corps in Chicopee to get her GED and train as a certified nursing assistant  but after getting in fights with other young women  she dropped out  “I’m soft and I’m sensitive  so when there’s trouble  I just get away from it ” she said  Ortiz found work at Old Navy and Stop   Shop  and eventually got her CNA license  and a job caring for elderly residents  at Marian Manor in South Boston  Then she got pregnant and moved to Louisville  Ky   to be with her boyfriend She ended up back in Boston alone after they broke up  with no child support  Taking him to court is “too much drama ” she said  Last year  Ortiz found a retail job at the Prudential Center  where she makes $9 60

from hallucinations and fears the world around him  t nBodio S  Hutchinson  34  was ordered held on $1 million bail after pleading not guilty to charges including armed assault with intent to murder The wounded rangers were identified as 46 year old Albert Hurd  a 22 year veteran  and James Lunnin  25  who joined the rangers this year  Authorities said the older ranger is in the intensive care unit at Massachusetts General Hospital  where his condition has been upgraded to serious  Lunnin was treated and released Hutchinson  who stands 6 foot 1 and weighs 290 pounds  has a history of bizarre and violent behavior  including unprovoked attacks on strangers and law enforcement  and episodes of savage biting  court records show  As of 2013  the records show  Hutchinson had 17 convictions — and even more arrests After one attack in a Newmarket Square McDonald’s in February of 2013  one of Hutchinson’s alleged victims asked him why he had suddenly begun punching a woman drinking a cup of coffee “Instead of answering me in words  he growled like a lion  Like a bear  No words at all  Just RAGGGHHHH ’’ Joseph Umbro  who jumped in to help the woman  recalled Wednesday  Umbro said he was pummeled and bitten by Hutchinson  “He had this crazed  animalistic look on his face  I will never forget it ’’In another violent outburst at Nashua Street Jail in 2010  it took nine officers to restrain Hutchinson  court records show  “Throughout the altercation and its aftermath  the defendant demonstrated almost super human strength and an indifference to pain ” the documents said During Hutchinson’s arraignment in Boston Municipal Court Wednesday  Assistant District Attorney Lynn Feigenbaum described the events leading up to the stabbing of the park rangers  At about 4 30 p m  Tuesday  the rangers went to the Soldiers and Sailors Monument on the Common after a report of a man there with a knife  The rangers used pepper spray  but it had no effect  she said  Hutchinson allegedly lunged  stabbing each ranger about five times and severing an artery in one ranger’s abdomen “He then sat calmly on the monument as others issued aid to one of his victims ” said Feigenbaum  “He then put on his hat and started to walk away ”Police chased Hutchinson into the Public Garden  where he allegedly threw something into the pond and then turned to pursuing officers  repeating “Shoot me  shoot me ” and crouching as if to attack  said Feigenbaum  Hutchinson threw himself to the ground  and officers cuffed him  Police later fished a knife with a five inch blade with a pink handle from the pond  she said Lopez  arguing for $5 000 bail  said her client was raised by an alcoholic and abusive father  failed by his family  and left to fend for himself at a young age  Hutchinson stood silently at her side  dressed in a white jumpsuit and dirty socks  periodically rolling his head from side to side Boston Municipal Court Judge Robert McKenna ordered Hutchinson held without bail on a number of probation violations  including failing to comply with drug testing  nHutchinson’s criminal history paints a picture of a violent man grappling with mental illness as far back as 1999 On a May morning that year  two Boston police officers said they found Hutchinson sitting in the middle of his street in Dorchester rolling a marijuana cigarette  Hutchinson told them he was “chilling” before allegedly punching them both in the face and injuring an EMT Police charged Hutchinson with assault  possessing marijuana  resisting arrest and disturbing the peace  but the case did not go to trial  A notation in the court record indicated that Hutchinson “may be depressed ” and possibly suicidal and the case was ultimately dismissed on the condition that Hutchinson cooperate with his probation officer  take his medication  and attend therapy It was the first of at least three alleged attacks on Boston police officers  according to court records  In April 2004  Hutchinson was charged with assault and battery on police officers  which was later reduced to resisting arrest  putting it on track for dismissal  But he violated probation and was sent to jail for nine months  the court said According to court records  in March of 2006  Hutchinson stormed into his mother’s apartment in Dorchester  trashed it  and microwaved metal canisters  causing sparks to fly  Aware of his mental problems  police urged him to surrender  He refused “Come on in and kill me  I don’t want to live anymore  I’ll only be leaving in a body bag  I’m not going back to any hospitals ” police said he told them An ensuing standoff lasted more than four hours  Police shot Hutchinson twice with a bean bag gun but it didn’t subdue him Police called in more than a dozen new officers  including the special operations team and the K 9 unit  They turned off power to the apartment and threw in canisters of gas designed to subdue him  according to records Fearing he would attempt suicide  police finally entered the apartment and found him locked in the bathroom  Police said he attacked four officers  biting  kicking  and swinging a metal pipe After short stay in Bridgewater State Hospital  Hutchinson was found guilty of multiple assaults  and sentenced to two years in the Suffolk County House of Correction Hutchinson was sentenced to up to another year and a half after attacking his uncle in 2008 By early 2010  Hutchinson was back in court for allegedly interrupting his roommate while the man was having sex  punching him repeatedly and then biting off a portion of the man’s ear  Hutchinson was acquitted by a jury The victim declined to testify against him  according to the Suffolk District Attorney’s Office After that arrest  Hutchinson exploded at correction officers at the Nashua Street Jail  Hutchinson punched  bit  and kicked six officers who were trying to get him under control after he refused to be stripsearched  records show During his trial  a defense mental health specialist argued that Hutchinson was a paranoid schizophrenic and chronic PCP and marijuana user  Hutchinson was convicted  but is appealing  nThe unprovoked attack on the woman in McDonalds was in February 2013  and Hutchinson was ordered to serve 18 months behind bars  He served most of the time while awaiting trial  according to records  It is not clear when he was released When he was arrested this week  Hutchinson gave his most recent address as the Pine Street Inn  but a spokeswoman said he had not stayed there in months  Hutchinson had previously stayed intermittently at the Long Island shelter  according to a Boston Public Health Commission spokeswoman  but on Sept  8 he was barred for 60 days for bringing contraband into the facility  nBoston Police spokesman Sergeant Michael McCarthy said Wednesday that the department is currently working to improve the quality of life on the Common  Arrests are up in the area since February  and a focus on drug enforcement appears to be driving down other crimes  he said McCarthy said that the stabbing would be reviewed to determine whether there are ways to make the rangers  who are not police officers and do not carry guns  safer On Wednesday afternoon  the Common was full of people enjoying the unusually warm weather Some said that the quiet during the day often gives way to violence at night Dana Montiero  21  recounted a late night encounter with a drunk man who hurled homophobic slurs at his group of friends  then punched him in the face No police or rangers were there to break up the fight  Montiero

they attacked one another’s records and plans for the future With less than two weeks until Election Day  and polls indicating a dead heat  both Coakley and Baker were tightly controlled and at times tense as they worked to avoid major gaffes or viral video moments that could suddenly upend the race  t nBut they still clashed over the most charged issues in the contest  including allegations that Coakley had ignored dire warnings about the problems in the state’s child protection system and that Baker was involved in a pay to play scandal Over the hour long debate  Coakley repeatedly challenged Baker on his record at Harvard Pilgrim Health Care  attacking him for increasing his salary and raising premiums while striking a deal that ultimately sent some jobs overseas  Baker appeared to talk at greater length and in deeper detail  while she struck back with some shorter  sharper retorts Baker took swipes at Coakley  as well  but seemed more determined to protect his warmer image and appeal to undecided and urban voters he will need to win in an overwhelmingly Demcractic state  He spoke less of spreadsheets and corporate experience and more about his urban agenda  At one point  he pledged that if he could use the governor’s bully pulpit to tackle one issue  it would be to find more nighttime activities for urban youth During another exchange  he recalled his experience riding along with a police officer on a Friday night in Dorchester  He recounted seeing families barbecuing and cheerleaders at a football game  and said the officer  “Sergeant Johnson ” recognized many of the faces at the field  “We’ve got to embed ourselves   as human beings   in these communities so people understand not only do we care about them  but we get where they’re coming from ” said Baker  who lives in Swampscott Coakley responded briskly  dismissing Baker’s experience as a brief foray into a minority community “Well  in fairness  I’ve done that for about 18 years as an assistant district attorney and a district attorney ” she said  “So I’m glad you got the ride along  Charlie ”Baker’s desire to cultivate a softer image   a contrast with the hard edged tone he presented in his 2010 campaign for governor   was evident throughout the night  When he was asked what the biggest misconception about him is  he said he chafed at the image painted by Democrats that he cares more about numbers than people “For me  it’s always been about people and it bothers me that a guy who is pretty facile with math  which does matter when you’re talking about a $38 billion budget  is somehow considered to be somebody who doesn’t care about people ” he said But Coakley did not concede that point  hammering the argument that he privatized mental health services and cut jobs when he was in state government in the 1990s and then increased his salary while outsourcing jobs at Harvard Pilgrim “I wouldn’t make those choices  Charlie ” she said  adding  “We can debate about whether you’re a good guy or not   I don’t dispute that  It’s about the values that drive your choices ”The debate  sponsored by the Boston Globe and WGBH  featured the candidates seated closely at a table  answering questions from moderators Jim Braude and Margery Eagan who sat across from them  Globe reporters also provided videotaped questions  Without the three independent candidates   Evan Falchuk  Scott Lively  and Jeff McCormick   the two leading contenders spent more time parsing and defending their records than in the previous  five person debates  The pair has one final televised debate left before the Nov  4 election As he has in past debates  Baker sharply criticized Coakley for defending the state from a lawsuit filed by a children’s advocacy group that has accused the Department of Children and Families of failing to properly care for foster children  He said her decision “not to fix it but to fight it” showed “a lack of judgment ”Coakley responded by pointing out that the case was dismissed by a judge  and said she was right to push back against “outside lawyers suing us with a one size fits all solution ”The problems at DCF surfaced again when the candidates watched clips of attack ads being run on their behalf by Super PACs  including one ad that harshly criticizes Coakley for fighting the lawsuit  Coakley called the ad “heinous” and said it essentially argues that “I sat by while children we killed ”“That’s outrageous ” she said But Baker said that while he disagreed with the tone of the ad  the questions it raised about her fight against the lawsuit were legitimate  And he expressed indignation that Coakley would criticize him for the ad when he said the first attack ad aired by a super PAC ad in the race went after him “She doesn’t have any credibility on this issue  in my opinion ” he said Coakley sought to put Baker on the defensive over allegations that he was involved in a play to play scheme involving a donation he made while working for a Cambridge based venture capital firm  Baker donated $10 000 to the New Jersey state Republican Party in 2011  Democrats have tried to tie that to a $15 million investment the New Jersey pension fund then made with Baker’s firm  General Catalyst Baker said he had commissioned an outside legal review that showed he did nothing wrong  But Coakley said the issue was by no means settled  “He’s under investigation now for a pay to play scheme ” she said  “Those facts at least on their face indicate at least from my point of view a reason to investigate ”In a rare moment of pique  Baker shot back that Coakley is the one with tarnished record involving campaign cash  alluding to a controversy last spring when Coakley settled allegations that she used her federal US Senate funds for state political activities  “Can I just point out there’s only one person at this table who has paid a campaign violation fine  and that’s the attorney general ” he said   n',

nThe 911 call came in to Boston police at 9 22 p m  “There’s a little girl shot on Humboldt Ave ” Screams and shrieks swirled in the background as the woman caller continued  “Oh God  Oh  the little girl on the ground  shot ”It was Aug  19  1988  a sultry night in the Grove Hall section of Roxbury  The girl on the ground was Darlene Tiffany Moore  a 12 year old who moments before was perched on a mailbox  talking with friends  Blood poured from three bullet wounds  One   to the head   was the wound a medical examiner termed “incompatible with life ” t tAn unintended victim of street gang vengeance  Tiffany Moore became an instant symbol of the drug fueled lawlessness then rocking the city  Police launched a massive search for the Halloween masked killers  Officials sought to calm a public crying out for an arrest and panicked by the soaring murder rate  Some in the community called for the deployment of the National Guard Two tense weeks later justice was apparently in hand  Shawn Drumgold  then 22  and a second man were charged with killing the girl  In their trial 14 months later  only Drumgold was convicted  Guilty of first degree murder  he was sentenced to life without parole  an outcome confirmed on appeal by the state’s highest court in 1996 But a Globe investigation has found a prosecution marred by faulty assumptions  questionable tactics  and possible wrongdoing at each stage of the high profile case  the initial homicide investigation  the indictment  and  finally  the trial  Shawn Drumgold was no innocent   a street corner drug dealer who had shot and been shot at  he surely fit the profile of a possible suspect  But the Globe review suggests strongly that Drumgold  who has protested his innocence from the day of his arrest  was not the killer In recent interviews  two witnesses recanted statements and testimony used to convict Drumgold  saying authorities bullied them into providing incriminating evidence  They and other witnesses described a pattern of intimidation by police intent on building a case against Drumgold  The Globe also located neighborhood residents who said they were frightened to testify in 1989 but will now come forward to support the alibi Drumgold offered detectives days after the murder   that he was several blocks away on Sonoma Street when Moore was shot Moreover  the Globe found that one key prosecution witness faced a raft of criminal charges that evaporated soon after he testified  while another witness who said she saw Drumgold leaving the scene of the murder   testimony by all accounts critical to Drumgold’s conviction   was suffering from a deadly brain cancer  Her condition  which can affect perception and memory  was not revealed to the defense or jury  t t nIn the age of DNA  guilt or innocence is sometimes established by conclusive genetic evidence  Most successful prosecutions don’t work that way  but are built fact upon fact  brick by brick  leading to a finding of guilt  Drumgold’s conviction now appears to have been built largely on sand Trial prosecutor Philip T  Beauchesne  now retired  recalled being surprised by the 1989 verdict  The evidence against Drumgold was “weak ” he said in a recent interview  and while he has not second guessed the jury or doubted Drumgold’s guilt  he said  “If I was wrong       If it was not Drumgold  then definitely the mistake should be corrected  The system is not perfect ” Police and other prosecutors declined to comment Fifteen years after a young girl’s death  Drumgold’s case continues to gnaw at some in the criminal justice system  causing “an uneasiness with police and assistant district attorneys who know the history of it ” said one police investigator who worked in Roxbury at the time and requested anonymity  citing fear of reprisals within the department  “Number one  because of the age of the victim  Number two  because the person convicted of the killing is the wrong person  This is a real tragedy  There’s been no justice either way ” nIn 1988  Humboldt Avenue was the focal point of Roxbury’s drug trade   “heroin alley ” some called it  The stretch along the broad avenue near Homestead Street was scarred by burned out homes  empty lots  and broken down cars  The dominant street culture revolved around cash  clothes  and cocaine Rampant drug use   especially crack   was behind a frightening rise in crime  The 95 homicides in 1988 in Boston would skyrocket to 152 by 1990  Gangs flourished  often adopting the name of their home street  There was Castlegate  for example  operating from the short  narrow street off Blue Hill Avenue  just north of Franklin Park  Or there was the gang on Humboldt itself  Both were widely feared  especially Humboldt  “Humboldt was a bulldozer at that time  You kill their dog  they kill your family ” a Boston police investigator said Shawn Drumgold was living that summer on Humboldt Avenue with his girlfriend and their baby daughter  His apartment was above a store at the intersection of Humboldt and Homestead  a popular gathering spot for neighborhood teens  Drumgold’s mother  sister  and other siblings lived about a block away  Drumgold had only been back in Boston a few months  having just completed a jail term in March for possession of cocaine  He soon picked up where he left off   using and dealing drugs  “I used it mostly for a sexual thing  for pleasure ” he said in a recent prison interview  Drumgold was usually seen hanging around and doing business with two friends  Terrance “Lug” Taylor and Antonio “Country” Anthony  All had criminal records The Friday night of Aug  19 was supposed to be the last night of young Tiffany Moore’s two week visit with her mother before returning to South Carolina  She was staying with relatives in the South to get her away from Boston’s mounting street troubles  The girl was on the corner of Humboldt and Homestead at twilight with a dozen or so teenagers  Moore sat atop the blue mailbox  her back to a fenced in Boston Edison substation  Seated next to her was one of the Humboldt gang leaders Vantrell “Trell” McPherson was standing next to Moore  Looking over her shoulder  the 14 year old saw two or three masked men running toward them across the small grassy Edison lot  “I screamed and I started pushing someone in front of me to get out of the way and then all these shots were fired ” she said in an interview  Kids scattered and fled  except Tiffany Moore  She lay dead Police  according to court records  concluded almost immediately that the shooting was part of an ongoing feud between the Castlegate and Humboldt street gangs   revenge for the wounding of a Castlegate member two weeks earlier The lead homicide detectives were Richard Walsh and Paul Murphy  both veterans  They soon learned the shooters were masked   one wore the Jason mask from the film “Friday the 13th”   and wore black Adidas sweatsuits  the lightweight running gear popular among Roxbury males at the time Lacking key physical evidence   the guns and masks   police were forced to rely on interviews with witnesses and other sources  Teenagers told police they had seen Drumgold and Taylor earlier that evening leave the apartment across the street from the mailbox  Both men were known drug dealers  and police picked up some street talk about a possible beef the two were having with another small time dealer There were leads on other possible suspects  but almost from the start  the focus was on Drumgold and Taylor   even though their involvement would defy basic street logic and common sense  according to recent interviews with two veteran police investigators who spoke on condition of anonymity  Drumgold and Taylor  they said  were freelance drug dealers unaffiliated with any gang  “Shawn was dealing in peace  not bothering either gang ” said one of the investigators who worked in Roxbury at the time Moreover  police  as part of the effort to combat escalating street gang violence  kept books listing street gang members and anyone who might be loosely associated with a gang  Drumgold and Taylor were not listed in the Castlegate book nor in any gang listing  according to police records and later trial testimony Even more puzzling was the notion that Drumgold  who lived on Humboldt Avenue  would be an agent of the Castlegates  “He was living on Humboldt  Why would he shoot at  Humboldt  ” one investigator asked  Drumgold and Taylor would have been hunted down and killed by the Humboldt gang  he said Such information didn’t stop police from telling reporters upon their arrest of Drumgold 10 days after Moore’s death that he was a “drug dealer and member of the Castlegate gang ” The arrest story was headlined in the Boston Herald  “  Tiffany killer’ jailed  Roxbury gang member charged in the murder of 12 year old girl ” a spread that featured a photograph of Drumgold  handcuffed  with a Boston police officer at his side “You have to understand  back then they  homicide  would get something and run right to the grand jury  It wasn’t like they’d first corroborate it ” the longtime investigator said  Given the public and political pressure  making an arrest was paramount  Building the case could come later  nThe Suffolk County grand jury that convened on Sept  8  1988  to take up the Moore killing heard testimony from just two witnesses   an extraordinarily small showing for a high profile murder case  The principal was Detective Walsh  who summarized the early evidence against Drumgold and Taylor  But a review of his testimony  other records  and new interviews suggests portions of Walsh’s account were  at best  misleading Walsh described questioning Tracie Peaks  a teenage girl who said she’d seen two men leaving the back of the Edison lot immediately after the shooting and had recognized one as Drumgold  Walsh also said Peaks described the men as wearing “black Adidas suits”   matching exactly the descriptions given by the teenagers at the crime scene In her testimony  however  Peaks flatly contradicted Walsh  “I told them black sneakers ” she said of her discussion with detectives  “Adidas sneakers and black jeans ”“Did you ever tell the officer that you saw Adidas suits ” she was asked “No ” the 16 year old said It was a standoff on a key investigatory detail  though one that paled next to Peaks saying she had seen Drumgold  whom she knew  near the crime scene  It turned out to be the first of several instances in which Walsh’s version was challenged During his presentation to the grand jury  Walsh testified that some of the most incriminating evidence police had obtained came from one of Drumgold’s drug dealing cohorts  Antonio “Country” Anthony  He said he and his partner met with Anthony  then 23  at the Area B police station in Roxbury on Aug  31   just a week before the grand jury session Walsh said that Anthony  in a taped interview  told him he had been hanging out with Drumgold and Taylor early in the evening of Aug  19  at the Humboldt Avenue apartment where Drumgold usually stayed  Anthony said Drumgold had told them that trouble was brewing   possibly even that night   in a drug turf dispute  and he displayed two  22 caliber pistols They all eventually left the apartment  with Drumgold and Taylor dropping their friend off at the Dudley T station  Anthony said he did not see either man the rest of the night  In short  Anthony left Drumgold and Taylor  armed and ready for trouble  only hours before Tiffany Moore was killed by shots from a  22 caliber handgun It was powerful stuff   but Antonio Anthony  in recent Globe interviews  said it was untrue  Anthony recanted key parts of what he told police and said much of Walsh’s testimony before the grand jury was false  “That is not how it happened ” he said  adding that he felt “under pressure” by police and told them what they wanted to hear Anthony was interviewed at the Old Colony Correctional Center in Bridgewater  where he is serving a seven year prison term for unarmed robbery  He confirmed parts of what police said he told them   that he was with Drumgold and Taylor at the Humboldt Avenue apartment early that evening and that they were packing pistols But Anthony said he was never dropped off at the Dudley T station when they left the apartment  “That never happened ” he said The truth  Anthony said  is that as darkness fell he  Drumgold  Taylor  and a fourth man left Humboldt Avenue and drove to 23 Sonoma St  so that he and Taylor could visit their girlfriends  He said Taylor was upstairs with his girlfriend  he was in the hallway with his  and Drumgold was hanging out downstairs Nearly an hour later  “we heard about a shooting that had happened ” He said Drumgold immediately wanted to return to Humboldt Avenue  worried the victim might be his sister “There’s no way he could have done that  killing  ” said Anthony  “I know that for a fact  Because I was with him and Lug on Sonoma Street when the shooting happened ”Reviewing the discrepancies between the transcript of his 1988 police interview and what he says now  Anthony said  “I went in there to tell the truth and they didn’t want to hear it  They wanted me to corroborate that they  Drumgold and Taylor  had done the shooting  They kept putting the same questions to me and I’d say   Yo  he didn’t do it  I was with him  He didn’t do it ’ They’d say   You holding back on us ’ “Anthony said he grew increasingly afraid that police were going to charge him in the murder  “I lost control of the whole situation ” he said in the Globe interview  “and I’m just doing what they want me to do  I’m just a dumb puppet in there ”Police spokeswoman Mariellen Burns declined requests for interviews with Walsh and other police officials  Citing the ongoing appeals in the case  she referred questions about Drumgold to the Suffolk County prosecutors’ office  Deputy District Attorney Joshua Wall also declined to comment  Beauchesne  the retired prosecutor  said Walsh “did not have any type of reputation as a rubberhose cop       I don’t think any witnesses were pressured excessively ”Anthony said he now understands why he was not summoned to testify in person at the grand jury  “I would have told the grand jury the same thing I told homicide ” he said  “I would have told the grand jury  no way Shawn and Lug coulda done it ” nOthers are also now prepared to join Anthony in corroborating Drumgold’s alibi  In separate interviews  three former Sonoma Street residents told the Globe they saw Drumgold  Taylor  and Anthony on their street when Tiffany Moore was killed several blocks away on Humboldt Avenue  Two never came forward and cooperated with police at the time and a third said she spoke to authorities but backed off after feeling intimidated by police “When I heard they got arrested for the shooting  I said   That’s impossible ’ because they were on Sonoma and could not have done it ” said Olisa Graham  “You can’t be two places at once ”Then 19 years old  Graham lived in a third floor apartment at 23 Sonoma St  She said that around twilight on the night of the murder  she returned home and ran into Anthony and Taylor in the building  Taylor  she said  was with her sister  She made a call  went out  and sat on a stoop  smoking a cigarette “I saw Shawn coming out of the building next to mine ” she said  “He went into the other building  Then 10 or 15 minutes go by and it seemed like all these people started coming up  People were saying there’s a shooting on Humboldt “Shawn came out of the other building and he crossed the street and stood in front of 23 Sonoma with Country and Terrance ” she said  The three then took off  she said Graham said she gave this information to authorities who met with her in her family’s apartment  She said she was willing to testify until one of the men who interviewed her telephoned with a warning  “ He  told me I wouldn’t be able to testify because I had a warrant  a shoplifting warrant ” she said  “He said if I was to testify there was a possibility I could be arrested after I got off the witness stand ”Court records show that Graham had an outstanding arrest warrant for shoplifting at the time  a charge that would be dismissed in 1999  Graham said no one contacted her again   and she was not about to stick her neck out  “I would have testified  I wanted to help  but when they told me that  it was like  OK  I don’t want to go to court and get arrested ” she said recently  Now 34 and taking nursing courses  she said she is willing to testify if there is a new challenge to Drumgold’s conviction Two others told the Globe they saw Drumgold and Taylor on Sonoma Street at the time of the shooting but had been afraid to go to police  “You didn’t want to get caught dead talking to the police ” said Gemini Hullum  The third resident  who asked not to be identified  echoed Hullum’s wariness  “I didn’t want to have any part of it  because of the way I was living back then ” said the resident  Besides  the resident said  people heard about the call Olisa Graham got  “People were scared of what the police were saying ”A trial witness recantsDuring the year after Darlene Tiffany Moore was gunned down  her death had an impact far beyond the investigation  Police cracked down on the gangs and beefed up foot patrols in known trouble spots  Federal  state  and local officials met with Roxbury community leaders  promising tougher laws to combat street crime and drug offenses  Talk of organizing neighborhood crime watch groups was widespread Then came time for justice for a 12 year old girl “All of society  all of the might of society has gathered to convict Shawn Drumgold ” Beauchesne told a Suffolk County jury in the fall of 1989  “Think of the person who isn’t here  Tiffany Moore is as much entitled to clear  cool  calm justice as is Shawn Drumgold ”The murder trial began on Oct  2  a cloudy Monday morning  It lasted 11 days and involved 47 witnesses  The gist of the state’s case was that Drumgold and Taylor  acting as hit men for the Castlegate gang  fired shots into a crowd of youths and killed the girl instead of the intended target  No witness placed Taylor at the crime scene  and he was acquitted by the trial judge To convict Drumgold  the prosecution  lacking physical evidence  relied on a half dozen witnesses whose testimony  taken together  portrayed Drumgold as the killer Vantrell “Trell” McPherson was one of those witnesses   although initially the teenager did not seem to have much to offer the prosecution  In her first taped interview with police  she said she and Tiffany Moore had run into Drumgold and Taylor at around 6 p m   hours before the shooting  “They were walking by ” McPherson said  according to the police transcript Twice the investigators asked  “Is there anything else you would like to add  Trell ” Twice she replied  “No ”But four months later  when she took the witness stand  there was more  McPherson now said Drumgold and Taylor seemed in a hurry when she and Moore ran into them  The new twist emerged in the following exchange between the prosecutor and McPherson “Did Mr  Taylor say anything in your presence to the defendant Shawn Drumgold ”“He said  “Come on  Shawn  you know we got to do this ”“Say that again slowly ”“Come on  Shawn  you know we got to do this ”“We got to go do this ”“Yes ”“Did you know what he meant ”“No ”“I have no further questions  your honor ”It was the climax to McPherson’s testimony  with the prosecutor pausing to savor the words that suggested Drumgold and Taylor were men with a mission the night Moore was shot But in a recent interview  McPherson recanted The testimony about Taylor  she said  was false  “I don’t remember anyone saying  “Come on  Shawn  we got to go do this ” McPherson said she did not even remember giving that testimony   because  she explained  she was “so shook up” by the time she took the stand  During witness preparation  she said  a member of the prosecution team berated her to the point of tears “He was yelling and screaming at me ” McPherson  then 15  said  She did not know the official’s name  “It was a fat guy ” she said  The two were alone in a room in the courthouse  “He was telling me how can I not know who it was wearing a mask  if I saw the person the same day  How can I not know it’s him even if he’s got a mask on  because I know Shawn and had seen him “I felt very much intimidated ” said McPherson  now 29  “He wasn’t backing off at all  He was really screaming in my face  to the point where I was crying  That man could have got me to say anything  the way he was in my face ”Sweetheart deal Another key trial witness was Ricky Evans  a young Roxbury man whom police stumbled across 10 months after the Moore shooting  three months before the trial Detectives had been in contact with him about another murder  “I don’t know why I brought it up  I just happened to hit him  Evans  with the question  “By the way  do you know anything on the Tiffany Moore murder ’ “ one detective later testified to explain the surprising good fortune Evans said he knew plenty  and on June 21  1989  he met with investigators and a prosecutor  according to police records  Evans said that on the night Moore was murdered he had seen Drumgold and Taylor outside his apartment building on Elm Hill Avenue  a few blocks from the crime scene  Both men were armed with pistols  he said  and he overheard Taylor telling Drumgold where they could find the two Humboldt gang leaders whom investigators believed were targeted for revenge by the Castlegate gang  Evans further said that he met up with Drumgold and Taylor later that night  after the murder  and that both had acted “strange” and told him they had “ditched” the pistols For homicide detectives  Evans’s account was like hitting the lottery  a witness who could testify about guns  motive  and cover up  Evans  meanwhile  was a wanted man himself  Even as he opened up to police about the Moore murder case  Evans  according to Roxbury District Court records  had at least four criminal cases pending against him   for trespassing  for car theft  and for possessing and dealing cocaine  If convicted of the most serious charges  he faced up to 10 years in prison Life improved for Evans  however  once he cooperated against Drumgold and Taylor  Six days after the June 21 meeting  a homicide detective drove Evans to the Roxbury court  where Evans’s outstanding arrest warrants were cleared up  Evans’s cases were then continued for further court action until Oct  10   after the trial  scheduled to begin Sept  19  was expected to be over At trial  Evans’s testimony was sharply challenged by lawyers for Drumgold and Taylor  who said his version was preposterous  Drumgold and Taylor did not even know Evans  the lawyers said  And Evans  they said  had a sweetheart deal with police  “Is it your testimony you don’t expect anything in return for your testimony here today ” one lawyer asked “No ” Evans replied  he expected no special treatment  It was his civic duty  he said Five days after Drumgold was convicted  the trespassing charge against Evans was dropped outright  The cocaine possession charges were continued without a finding and would be erased so long as he performed five hours of community service   Evans never did the five hours  according to records   The stolen car case was also continued without a finding  A crack cocaine dealing charge was not brought up during the bulk disposition and  according to records  remains an open case For all practical purposes  Evans left court free and easy  In a recent interview  Evans declined to answer questions about his role as a witness against Drumgold or his relationship with homicide detectives  He cut off the questions during a brief meeting near his South Boston apartment  “There was no coercion ” he said  “What I said was the way it happened ” nDrumgold was convicted of first degree murder on Friday  Oct  13  after fewer than six hours of deliberations over two days  The jury consisted of five men and seven women and included one black  the foreman  Lance E  Woodley  In the years since  one juror has died  another suffers from failing memory  and a third’s health troubles prevented her from discussing the case  Most have moved away from Boston Five jurors  in interviews  said the tipping point for a guilty verdict was one girl’s testimony  “The biggest thing that stands out was that Shawn Drumgold was identified ” said Woodley  “The girl who said she looked right in his eyes ”That “girl” was 22 year old Mary Alexander  and her path to a courtroom identification was hardly a straight line  She lived in an apartment at 72 Homestead St  with her mother and children  Detectives first came to see her seven days after the murder  according to police records  She told them she saw two men walk past her after the shooting  “putting what she believed to be guns inside their pants ” according to a police report  But she could not identify either man “The officers observed Mary Alexander pick up the photo no  304 159  the photo of Shawne  sic  Drumgold several times look at this photo for some time put it down and pick it up again and again before saying she could not make an identification of any of the photos of the two men she had seen ” according to the police report Alexander wouldn’t make her first positive identification until 13 months later  just as the trial began and after the blaze of media coverage fingering Drumgold as the killer  When she took the witness stand she confidently and positively identified Drumgold “I’ll never forget those eyes  because they was like staring ” she testified For the jurors  her words proved compelling  “I totally believed her ” said juror Kimberly Barr  “I was just so impressed with her description  she said she’d never forget those eyes ” said Sheila Finnerty  “That clinched it for me ” said Cecille Y  Manning about the girl’s identification  Woodley  the foreman  said  “You remember something that was strong   like someone saying  I saw him ”But unknown to jurors or defense attorneys was that young Mary Alexander suffered from brain cancer in 1989  She died four years later  “Cause of death was Cerebral Astrocytoma  Seizure Disorders  Five years of Disorder ” according to her death certificate  The fatal brain cancer  according to oncologists  can affect a person’s memory  perception  and cognitive function In an interview  Lola Alexander said her daughter was first diagnosed when she was 20 years old  in early 1988  “She was getting very severe headaches  I used to have to sit up all night with her and hold her head like a baby ” One day  she said  Mary “fell on her face ” was rushed by ambulance to the hospital  and the brain cancer was diagnosed  Mary underwent various treatments  the mother said Neither the defense nor the jury knew about the fatal condition   but police did  the mother said  “They didn’t care she had cancer  that had nothing to do with her mouth ” She said police came around often  “I think they were trying to coach her what to say ” Moreover  the mother said police were after her to testify  too  “I didn’t see nothing  and they wanted me to see something ” she said  “They were saying   You got to have seen something ”‘Beauchesne  the prosecutor  said he never knew Mary Alexander had a fatal brain cancer until a Globe reporter brought it up  “Talking to her  there was nothing about her that would indicate that she was anything but an average  ordinary citizen ” He also said that without her testimony  Drumgold would have been acquitted  “I was trying a case that was falling apart on me ” he said  “Going down the tubes ” Her identification turned around what he’d figured was going to be “a high publicity loser ”Told recently about Alexander’s cancer and asked whether the medical condition might have affected the jury’s verdict  Barr paused and then said  “It was easier making the decision not knowing that fact  If that were part of the mix it would have been a more complicated decision ”Seeking a new day in courtToday Shawn Drumgold is a much different looking man than when he was arrested in 1988  He is 37  no longer the skinny drug dealer who worked the streets of Roxbury  Lifting weights  he’s bulked up  His head is shaved Following a few disciplinary controversies early on  Drumgold settled into a largely uneventful prison life  In interviews  he said he became a Muslim  earned a high school equivalency diploma in May 1995  and now takes correspondence college courses through Bunker Hill Community College His daughter  a baby when he was convicted  is now a teenager attending a Boston high school  and Drumgold said he tries his best to stay involved with her upbringing Throughout  Drumgold has maintained his innocence ”We went to Sonoma Street ” he told police 10 days after the shooting  and he has never changed his story  For years he and his appellate attorney  Rosemary Curran Scapicchio  have unsuccessfully pursued appeals in state and federal court  Most recently  Drumgold’s hopes have grown based on several new developments  For one  Olisa Graham has come forward  providing a sworn affidavit corroborating the Sonoma Street alibi and saying police intimidated her at the time Even members of the Castlegate gang have said Drumgold was not the shooter  The disclosures were made in the wake of a 1998 federal racketeering indictment of about 30 Castlegate members  During debriefings  at least two defendants said it was common knowledge Drumgold was not Moore’s killer  Boston police and Suffolk prosecutors eventually conducted interviews with the men but discounted their information as hearsay For her part  Scapicchio last year filed a motion for a new trial based on new evidence  relying on the Castlegate gang disclosures and Graham’s alibi corroboration  Her request for a hearing on the new evidence is scheduled to be heard soon by Superior Court Judge Barbara J  Rouse  A spokesman for Suffolk County District Attorney Daniel F  Conley said prosecutors continue to stand by Drumgold’s conviction  noting it has been upheld on appeal  but that Conley would not challenge a judge’s order  if there were one  to hold a hearing  “We would always consider any substantive evidence ” said Joshua Wall  Conley’s top deputy  “Our interest in seeing that convictions are correct is always present ”Woodley  the jury foreman  is one who would welcome a reexamination of the conviction  “I always question whether I did the right thing ” he said  “I still question  is this the right guy “Too often the justice system doesn’t do justice ” he said That sentiment is not his alone  Back in 1989  even Tiffany Moore’s mother was not wholly persuaded about Drumgold’s guilt  In the city’s two major newspapers  Alice Moore expressed relief that one of the killers was convicted  “At least they got one ” she said  But a neighborhood newspaper captured a different side of the mother   one full of doubts  “It was very hard to tell if he was the right one ” Alice Moore  who died in 1994  told the weekly Bay State Banner  “It’s a big mess ”Dick Lehr can be reached at lehr globe com', '2014_1142')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no

Monday to be the city’s first chief of economic development  a key post in a new administration that has promised major changes at the Boston Redevelopment Authority With the announcement  Walsh outlined his vision for an inclusive City Hall that will aim to spur economic development beyond downtown and the Seaport District  promising growth in neighborhoods across the city  He focused particularly on small business and said he will seek to make Boston “a place where everyone can climb the economic ladder to success ” t nBarros  the mayor said  has the right resume for the job  The 40 year old has Ivy League credentials  Dartmouth College   time in corporate America  Chubb Group of Insurance Cos  in Manhattan   knowledge of community development  executive director of the Dudley Street Neighborhood Initiative   and experience facing the challenges of owning a small business  Restaurante Cesaria in Dorchester  Beyond those qualifications  the mayor said he was struck by Barros’s affinity for his hometown “He’s a guy that deeply cares about the city of Boston ” Walsh said at a press conference  “That’s what we want to make sure we get — people in the  mayor’s  Cabinet that love this city and care about this city and want to make sure we move forward ”Barros  a former School Committee member  was once Walsh’s rival as both men ran for mayor last year in the crowded preliminary election  Barros finished sixth  but he and another losing candidate  Felix G  Arroyo  joined Walsh’s campaign in the final election Soon after  Charlotte Golar Richie also backed Walsh  giving him the potent support of another prominent mayoral candidate of color  The endorsements gave Walsh a substantial boost among black and Latino voters  and helped him expand beyond his base and win the election Barros’s appointment as economic development czar had been widely expected  Walsh named Arroyo chief of health and human services shortly before taking office in January Golar Richie is a co chair of Walsh’s transition team  like Arroyo and Barros  but she has not been appointed to a city job  Golar Richie did not respond to inquiries Monday from the Globe  A Walsh spokeswoman declined to answer questions about Golar Richie but said there were no other appointments at this time At the press conference Monday  Walsh said he did not promise city jobs to people who endorsed his candidacy “It never came up in discussion with anybody  including Charlotte         or any elected official who supported me ” Walsh said  “We didn’t talk about it ”Walsh’s administration did not respond to an inquiry about how many other candidates were interviewed for the economic development post Barros is the son of Cape Verdean immigrants and his presence will add diversity to the administration’s 17 member Cabinet  Walsh pledged during the campaign that at least half of his Cabinet would be people of color  but  an article last week critical of the lack of diversity in top appointments Walsh has named eight people to permanent posts in his Cabinet  Five have been white  and three have been people of color  Walsh has also made two interim appointments  both white   and two Cabinet positions are vacant  Five officials remain from the administration of former mayor Thomas M  Menino and they are all white  although at least two are expected to leave In his post as economic development chief  Barros will have jurisdiction over an array of city departments and agencies  His appointment was announced at   a nonprofit cooking school that trains urban teens for culinary careers  The setting was designed to underscore the importance of small business and job training programs “I’m really excited to work with a mayor that has a vision that includes everyone in Boston ” Barros said at the press conference  nWith Barros as chief of economic development  the Boston Redevelopment Authority will maintain its own director and board  but the agency will be under his purview  Walsh said he and Barros hope to name a new director to the redevelopment authority by the summer Barros will also oversee consumer affairs and licensing  tourism  the Boston Employment Commission  jobs and community service  special events  and the Small and Local Business Enterprise Office Barros is a “bright guy” who understands business and development  said Darryl Settles  a developer and entrepreneur who owns Darryl’s Corner Bar   Kitchen  Barros knows the challenges faced by small businesses  said Settles  who was encouraged by the appointment of Barros and what Settles described as young  new talent at City Hall “My hope as they go forward is that it’s a more inclusive Boston when it comes to economic development ” said Settles  who supported former city councilor John R  Connolly’s bid for mayor  “We want to make sure that the rules are the same for everyone  that everyone has equal access to opportunities  People just want an even playing field ”Walsh’s administration did not release Barros’s salary because a spokeswoman said it had not been finalized  Other newly appointed Cabinet officials are being paid $124 000 to $174 000  according to city records Barros helped start Restaurante Cesaria  a family owned establishment that serves Cape Verdean food  Records show that Barros gave up ownership of the business in 2011  but he said in an interview that he still has a financial stake in the restaurant The restaurant has fallen behind on its taxes  and the state has filed two liens against it since November  according to records from the secretary of state Restaurante Cesaria had set up payment plans with the Internal Revenue Service and the state Department of Revenue because it owed $14 500  in part because it was delinquent on workers’ compensation payments    On Monday  Barros said the restaurant still owed roughly the same amount  which stemmed partly from a misunderstanding over payroll taxes', '2014_65')","('no

initially collected $61 million for the victims of the Boston Marathon attacks  has grown by an additional $12 million  as donors from around the world continue to donate  Now  the outpouring of generosity has the organization considering new ways to disburse the funds The nonprofit group  which was formed days after the April 15 attacks  which killed three people and injured more than 260  has tapped a council made up of survivors and victims’ relatives to help it decide how to distribute the latest donations  including whether to give money to those traumatized by the horror they witnessed that day  even if they were not physically harmed The goal is “still helping those most affected ” said Mike Sheehan  One Fund treasurer  “But the definition of that  with more education  might change a bit ”The new donations came from an array of sources — from corporate fund raisers to children who dropped coins into envelopes  There were donations from second graders who gave up their First Communion money and couples who eschewed wedding presents and instead told their guests to donate to the fund Sheehan said he was especially moved by a person who donated $7 “I am hypothesizing  but that’s someone who wanted to give 10 but could only afford 5 ” Sheehan said  “Somebody sacrificed to help someone they don’t know ”During its first 90 days  One Fund Boston collected nearly $61 million  and by July 29 it had distributed all of the money to more than 230 people hurt and relatives of those killed  Some of them were double amputees or victims whose limbs were severed  Others were severely burned  suffered shattered bones and nerves  or lost their hearing or vision in one eye But the organization was criticized for whom it rejected and how much it disbursed to individual victims Double amputees each received $2 2 million  and those who stayed overnight in a hospital were eligible for $125 000 or more if they stayed multiple nights But other victims felt shortchanged  like a 43 year old doctor who said he had to start seeing fewer patients after he lost his hearing during the blast Others who were not physically injured said they were so traumatized that they needed psychological help Sheehan said the One Fund has not made any decisions about how the next round of funds will be distributed “There is going to be a new process  and we haven’t decided whether it gets expanded or focused even more ” said Sheehan  who is also chief executive of the Boston advertising firm Hill Holliday The plan is to give out the $12 million in early July  but the organization expects to receive even more donations around the one year anniversary of the tragedy  Sheehan said that unlike last time  the group may keep some of the money in reserve to help victims with any future costs they incur as a result of their injuries “We just want to make sure that we’re really  really thoughtful and thorough about it ” he said  “It’s not going to be perfect  but we have an obligation to help those who need it most ”The council has met twice  once in October at City Hall and again on Dec  20 at Hill Holliday’s offices on State Street Members of the One Fund’s board of directors want the council to help them figure out what future problems victims may face  such as dealing with the cost of replacing a prosthetic limb  deciding which medical services will help them the most  and meeting any needs that were not met during the first round of giving One of the council members is the brother in law of Bill Richard  the father of Martin Richard  an 8 year old Dorchester boy who was killed in the attacks  Martin’s 7 year old sister lost one of her legs  His mother lost vision in one eye  and Bill Richard lost much of his hearing Larry Marchese  a family friend and spokesman  said the Richards believe that witnesses and emergency officials who responded that day should get some kind of support “There is that next level of victims ” Marchese said  “They’re having a really hard time dealing with what they saw and experienced that day  I think that’s something the One Fund should have on its radar ”Survivors of the attacks got e mails about the new funds Thursday “It’s great and wonderful that people are still donating money ” said James “Bim” Costello  a 31 year old from Malden whose arm and leg were burned so badly he needed pigskin grafts  “We never thought we’d get the money we did get  never mind getting more ”Jarrod Clowery  36  a carpenter who was burned and hit by shrapnel  said he was moved by the generosity of the donors  but ambivalent about whether he should make a claim for more money “I truly don’t care if I receive another penny from the One Fund ” he said  “What they did the first go around was fair ”But he said those who lost limbs  including two of his friends  could need support for the rest of their lives “If someone is going to get money  I would say all the amputees should get the lion’s share ” Clowery said  “As far as money goes  what they gave me was unbelievable  But money doesn’t help with your life getting flipped upside down   n', '2014_1200')","('no article',

toward the sky The service officially installed the Rev  Liz Walker as pastor  but for much of the ceremony she prayed as a member of the flock  Those in attendance shoved jackets under the church’s pews to make room for an overflow crowd   t nWhen the time came for her to speak  Walker  the first black woman to coanchor a newscast in Boston  offered only brief remarks about the power of God “Of all the things I’ve done  this is what I’m sure of  His grace is sufficient ” she said Walker has served as transitional leader of the church since 2011  and Sunday’s service made her its designated pastor At the service  residents joined elected and appointed officials in lauding Walker  saying that she moves effortlessly between church laity and city leaders  She preached before President  Obama  Governor Deval Patrick  and former mayor Thomas M  Menino at an interfaith service after the Marathon bombings last year   t nBefore Sunday’s service  Menino said Walker’s sermons “are great  but her outreach in the community” is what distinguishes her More than a handful of people stepped forward during the two hour service in the hot church to  offer congratulations and share stories Stephen Walker  a Roxbury resident who is not related to the reverend  praised the pastor for her visibility in the neighborhood “Sometimes I believe that Rev  Liz has a room here because she’s everywhere ” he said  “Any time the community needs her  she’s available ”Suzan El Rayess  development director of the Islamic Society of Boston Cultural Center  said Walker is a devoted leader in the city’s interfaith community “There is no other force as dynamic  as charismatic as Rev  Liz Walker when she steps up on the stage  She is a force that can probably part the Red Sea ” El Rayess said  The Rev  Gloria White Hammond  co pastor of Bethel AME Church  recalled traveling to Sudan with Walker years ago when they saw hundreds of slaves near Darfur “She doesn’t lead with her celebrity  she leads with her humility ” White Hammond said  Mayor Martin J  Walsh said he plans to turn to Walker for help in understanding and assuaging the trauma of violence in Boston’s neighborhoods  “As a new mayor of the city of Boston  I need you to be my partner ” Walsh told the pastor in front of the congregation  Walker took photos with her family after the official installation ceremony and downplayed the praise of city leaders  calling herself “just a new voice” and saying she is humbled to work with them in the future  She said Roxbury Presbyterian has supported the community from its

talking about this race  Actually  it’s a lot earlier  t nThe city’s Election Department hasn’t finalized an official elections calendar  Its website says “There are no local  or special elections scheduled at this time ” And the council is in the middle of its two year term  elections having been held just over 13 months ago  And still  at least three people — Bryan Fuller  Andrea J  Campbell  and Annissa Essaibi George — already have declared their candidacy for November 2015 by doing such things as creating campaign accounts  forming political committees  and raising money “I cannot remember anybody ever announcing before the first of the year ” said former city councilor Larry DiCara  “But there are no rules  no laws involved ”Early candidacy usually comes into play when an incumbent decides not to run  precipitating a crush of candidates jockeying for the vacancy  Think  the historic 2013 race for mayor when the late Thomas M  Menino announced he would not seek a sixth term in office  Twelve candidates ran for office  and there was a domino effect with a groundswell of candidates seeking City Council seats  For example  19 people  George among them  ran for the four at large council seats  Not next year  “We had an unusual circumstance because we had an open mayor’s race ” said Sabino Piemonte  of the election department  “We don’t anticipate an enormous amount of candidates ”Ten of the 13 sitting councilors said they plan to seek reelection  though some puzzled over why this was a topic of conversation just yet  Councilors Stephen J  Murphy  Michael Flaherty  and Frank Baker did not respond to a Globe query about their intentions for 2015  “It’s a bit early to be asking about reelection  I’m in the middle of my term ” said Councilor Mark Ciommo  “I’m focused on my work right now  but I have every intention of running again ” Unseating an incumbent is no easy task  said former city councilor Michael Ross  who vacated the District 8 seat  which includes the Back Bay  Beacon Hill  and Mission Hill  in an unsuccessful bid for mayor in 2013  “It’s very rare that incumbents are unseated  especially district city councilors ” said Ross  who held the seat for 14 years and now writes an opinion column for the Globe  “As a result  you’re not necessarily going to have a candidate who is  quote unquote  a serious candidate ”Still  he said  it’s not impossible  Flaherty knocked off an incumbent in 1999  unseating Albert “Dapper” O’Neil who served for 28 years  Flaherty then made an unsuccessful bid for mayor in 2009  only to return to the council in 2013  Of the three candidates who have informally declared their intentions to run — they’re not officially candidates until they pull paperwork — only one is running for a district seat  Campbell is challenging Councilor Charles Yancey  who has represented parts of Dorchester and Mattapan for more than 30 years  In fact  Yancey is the first and the only person to represent District 4  He has been in the job since district council seats were created in 1983  He has no intention of changing that  “I do intend to run for reelection to Boston City Council next year ” Yancey said  Campbell  a 32 year old Mattapan resident who served as deputy counsel for Governor Deval Patrick  said in a statement that “this campaign is part of a lifetime commitment to serve and invest in the community that provided a supportive and encouraging environment for me ” The Boston native and product of the city’s school system plans to spend the coming weeks continuing to educate herself about residents’ needs and aspirations “for our community  Only together  will we move our community forward ” While she has yet to formally announce her candidacy  she has amassed quite a war chest  Campbell has raised more than $15 000 since forming her political committee in November  according to the state Office of Campaign and Political Finance  The chairwoman of the committee is Wilnelia Rivera  who was John Barros’s deputy campaign manager when he ran for mayor in 2013  George and Fuller are both running for at large seats  This is Fuller’s first time as a candidate  George finished fifth last year  missing a spot on the council by 14 455 votes  For George  the seed to run for City Council was planted last February when reading a newspaper column questioning the dearth of female candidates in last year’s mayoral race  Of the 12 candidates  there was one woman  “I do remember thinking  You are right  Where are the women ” the 41 year old Dorchester native recalled  “In retrospect  I wish I started right then in February  which is why I’m starting now ” The issues remain the same  she said  education  economic development  the impact of poverty on children  and supporting small business  As a high school teacher  mother of four  and small business owner  George said  “my voice is missing on City Council ”Her background  she said  will allow her to inject first hand knowledge into discussions about such things as class size  student assignment  and pulling the necessary permits to open a business  For Fuller  this is the pursuit of a lifelong dream  The South Boston resident and Hamilton native said he has wanted to run for office since he was a child  an ambition well known by the 45 year old’s friends  In fact  he said  it was a friend who gave him the needed nudge this fall  “Boston has an obligation to all its citizens  and one reason I feel so strongly about this is because so many of our indigent are veterans ” he said  “I know first hand how difficult that transition can be  and I had a best case scenario  I had a college degree and no physical injuries ” The environment  education  poverty  and veterans affairs are key issues for the Army veteran  Fuller graduated from UMass Amherst with a degree in political science  and “the very next day I was on a bus to Fort Leonard Wood ” After his five years of service were up in 1999  including two tours in Bosnia  he enrolled in Boston University  where he received a master’s in business administration  Boston has been his home since  “I would like to be part of the

but also attacked each other’s records and plans for the future With less than two weeks until Election Day and polls indicating a dead heat  both Coakley and Baker were tightly controlled and at times tense as they worked to avoid major gaffes or viral video moments that could suddenly upend the race  t nBut they still clashed over the most charged issues in the contest  including allegations that Coakley had ignored dire warnings about the problems in the state’s child protection system and that Baker was involved in a pay to play scandal Over the hour long debate  Coakley repeatedly challenged Baker on his record at Harvard Pilgrim Health Care  faulting him for increasing his salary and raising premiums while striking a deal that ultimately sent some jobs overseas  Baker appeared to talk at greater length and in deeper detail  while Coakley struck back with some shorter  sharper retorts Baker took swipes at Coakley  as well  but seemed more determined to protect his warmer image and appeal to undecided and urban voters he will need to win in an overwhelmingly Democratic state He spoke less of spreadsheets and corporate experience and more about his urban agenda  At one point  he pledged that if he could use the governor’s bully pulpit to tackle one issue  it would be to find more nighttime activities for urban youth During another exchange  he recalled his experience riding along with a police officer on a Friday night in Dorchester  He recounted seeing families barbecuing and cheerleaders at a football game  and said the officer  “Sergeant Johnson ” recognized many of the faces at the field “We’ve got to embed ourselves — as human beings — in these communities  so people understand not only do we care about them  but we get where they’re coming from ” said Baker  who lives in Swampscott Coakley responded pointedly  dismissing Baker’s experience as a brief foray into a minority community “Well  in fairness  I’ve done that for about 18 years as an assistant district attorney and a district attorney ” she said  “So I’m glad you got the ride along  Charlie ”Baker’s desire to cultivate a softer image — a contrast with the hard edged tone he presented in his 2010 campaign for governor — was evident throughout the night  When he was asked what the biggest misconception about him is  he said he chafed at the image painted by Democrats that he cares more about numbers than people “For me  it’s always been about people  and it bothers me that a guy who is pretty facile with math  which does matter when you’re talking about a $38 billion budget  is somehow considered to be somebody who doesn’t care about people ” he said But Coakley did not concede that point  hammering the argument that he privatized mental health services and cut jobs when he was in state government in the 1990s and then increased his salary while outsourcing jobs at Harvard Pilgrim “I wouldn’t make those choices  Charlie ” she said  adding  “We can debate about whether you’re a good guy or not  I don’t dispute that  It’s about the values that drive your choices ”The debate  sponsored by the Boston Globe and WGBH  featured the candidates seated closely at a table  answering questions from moderators Jim Braude and Margery Eagan  who sat across from them  Globe reporters also provided videotaped questions Without the three independent candidates — Evan Falchuk  Scott Lively  and Jeff McCormick — the two leading contenders spent more time parsing and defending their records than in the previous  five person debates  The election is Nov  4 As he has in past debates  Baker sharply criticized Coakley for defending the state from a lawsuit filed by a children’s advocacy group that has accused the Department of Children and Families of failing to properly care for foster children  He said her decision “not to fix it but to fight it” showed “a lack of judgment ”Coakley responded by pointing out that the case was dismissed by a judge and said she was right to push back against “outside lawyers suing us with a one size fits all solution ”The problems at DCF surfaced again when the candidates watched clips of attack ads being run on their behalf by super PACs  including one ad that harshly criticizes Coakley for fighting the lawsuit  Coakley called the ad “heinous” and said it essentially argues that “I sat by while children were killed ”“That’s outrageous ” she said But Baker said that although he disagreed with the tone of the ad  the questions it raised about her fight against the lawsuit were legitimate  And he expressed indignation that Coakley would criticize him for the ad when he said the first attack ad aired by a super PAC in the race went after him “She doesn’t have any credibility on this issue  in my opinion ” he said Coakley sought to put Baker on the defensive over allegations that he was involved in a play to play scheme involving a donation he made while working for a Cambridge based venture capital firm  Baker donated $10 000 to the New Jersey state Republican Party in 2011  Democrats have tried to tie that to a $15 million investment the New Jersey pension fund then made with General Catalyst  the firm for which Baker was working Baker said he had commissioned an outside legal review that showed he did nothing wrong But Coakley said the issue was by no means settled  “He’s under investigation now for a pay to play scheme ” she said  “Those facts at least on their face indicate at least from my point of view a reason to investigate ”In a rare moment of pique  Baker shot back that Coakley is the one with a tarnished record involving campaign cash  alluding to a controversy last spring when Coakley settled allegations that she used her federal US Senate funds for state political activities  “Can I just point out there’s only one person at this table who has paid a campaign violation fine  and that’s the attorney general ” he said  n', '2014_1037')","('no article',

busy first six months at the helm of Roxbury Community College  long one of the city’s most tragically wasted resources Just a couple years ago  the school was nothing short of a mess  Its graduation rate was stuck in the single digits  The advisory system that was supposed to help students navigate college was little more than a rumor  which was one of the reasons so few students managed to graduate  Financial aid — which most of its 2 500 students rely on — was an administrative nightmare  Legally mandated reports on campus crime were either missing or clearly incomplete  The allegations against faculty and staff included  incredibly  sexual assault  t nAmong the missteps  A group of high powered business leaders who wanted to finance a job training program were unceremoniously turned away in 2012 by then president Terrence Gomes  The program went to Bunker Hill Community College   nThe problems came to light partly through the work of a brave group of internal whistle blowers  After a series of Globe stories and columns  Governor Deval Patrick replaced most of the board of trustees and forced Gomes into retirement That was the campus Valerie Roberson agreed to take over last summer  arriving from Olive Harvey College  in her native Chicago  Since arriving  she has removed or reassigned most senior administrators  with the majority resigning or retiring  She has begun to rebuild the school’s student services and to try to build relationships with local high schools  which for years have steered their students elsewhere Roberson said it was the challenge of turning around a troubled school that attracted her to the job “I think the opportunity to give back in a community this diverse is something that really attracts me ” Roberson said  She said she liked the idea of “coming to a place where there is support for change  there’s a need for change and me feeling confident that I have the skills to make the changes that are necessary ”The consensus for change at Roxbury Community College came about gradually  as even die hard supporters realized the school wasn’t working  Roberson is refreshingly candid about the need to fix basic programs and services  even as she maintains that some areas of the school function well In essence  she has learned that many of the original criticisms of the school — long denied by administrators and apologists — were true  She said financial aid and student advisement are already improving  aided by investments in software that the previous regime deemed too expensive The bid to overhaul RCC comes at a critical time  Community colleges are being pressed to play a greater role in preparing students for thousands of entry level jobs that are going wanting  Just a few blocks away sits a world class medical community whose jobs RCC students have  through no fault of their own  been largely denied Roberson said she supports the notion of expanded job training but insisted that there is still an important role for traditional liberal arts education There is  she said  no need to make it an either or choice  “We have a faculty that understands that a student can be prepared for work or to transfer  to a four year college   and then that student has options ” Roberson said  “I don’t think there s any conflict at all ”One of the strengths of RCC is the deeply

national minimum wage to $10 10  adding 375 000 apprenticeships across the country  and passing federal legislation granting workers paid sick leave  This month  Massachusetts voters  requiring businesses with 11 or more workers to let employees earn up to 40 hours of paid sick time per year In June  the Legislature enacted a law that will raise the state’s minimum wage to $11 an hour by 2017 The Obama administration is also trying to foster European style apprenticeships in which workers “earn while they learn ” Perez said  He called apprenticeships “the other college” because they teach skills that boost paychecks  About 410 000 people are working are apprentices nationwide  a Labor Department spokesman said Ar the Joseph W  Joyce Apprenticeship Training Center in Dorchester

message of Market Basket protesters  In October  Perez  at two events in Washington at which he applauded the management style of Arthur T  Demoulas “I thought Market Basket was a remarkable example

and Medicaid administrator known for passionate speeches about single payer health care  Entry is free — but you may run into your grandparents or their friends  t nBig progressive ideas not your jam  You missed Republican Charlie Baker’s June “Great Again Massachusetts” tour  which rolled to venues like a bakery in Fall River and a Roxbury restaurant And unless you’re looking for parental supervision  the recently launched “Moms for Martha” tour  led by Attorney General Martha Coakley  might not be the best place to rock out These aren’t stadium packing music tours that draw tens of thousands of adoring fans But the political tours that dot the landscape in this campaign season — a series of events hooked to a theme — give gubernatorial hopefuls and candidates of all stripes a way to infuse energy into old fashioned campaign stops and frame them as part of a more pointed story about what they hope to accomplish if voters give them the nod The tours also help them garner media coverage for what could otherwise seem like just another event to hear from residents  give a stump speech and shake hands  t n“How do you attract attention in the summertime among people before you go up on television  How do you let people know that you’re alive and well  You come up with a creative tour ” said longtime Massachusetts Democratic consultant Michael Goldman  who is unaffiliated in the governor’s race  “The more creative the tour  the more coverage you get ”The tours can imbue a narrative into travels from Provincetown to Pittsfield  helping to reach voters outside the Boston area “It’s a nice little way to package visits around the state ” said Republican strategist Jason Kauppi The title of Berwick’s “All Means All” tour comes from his state Democratic Party convention speech  in which he referenced the final words of the Pledge of Allegiance — “with liberty and justice for all” — and told the cheering crowd that “all means  ”Leigh Appleby  a Berwick spokesman  said the tour has brought Berwick  who often drives himself to eventsin his 2001 Subaru accompanied by a single aide  to cities and towns across the state  focusing on communities that are underrepresented Appleby acknowledged during Berwick’s tour “the trajectory of the message hasn’t changed markedly” from what Berwick was saying before the tour  Still  he said  “it tends to be events more centered on communities that have been left behind ”Baker’s “Great Again Massachusetts” tour was aimed at highlighting the Republican’s economic message in the run up to the June state Democratic Party convention Baker  and his running mate  Karyn Polito  made stops from Charlestown to Chicopee  alliteration in tours is a plus  Tim Buckley  a Baker spokesman  insisted the tour stops were different from standard campaign events because they were built around a theme “This one had a theme to juxtapose Charlie’s moderate and job creating message with our opponents  who were in the midst of a fistfight leading up to their convention  jostling with each other to get as far left as possible ” he said To a reporter with him at one of the stops though  Baker looked a whole lot like he did when not on a tour — introducing himself  sitting down with people  and listening to what they had to say Regardless  his spokesman indicated the tour was successful enough that there would be another  “It’s safe to say that ‘Great Again Massachusetts’ won’t be the last tour ” Buckley said with a laugh Coakley  a Democrat  kicked off the “Moms for Martha” tour earlier this month  and has been meeting with mothers across the state to hear about issues of importance to families  This comes after an “On Our Terms” tour  during which she discussed ways to build an economy that gives everyone a fair shot Coakley campaign manager Tim Foley said all campaign events were about talking to voters and listening to them speak about issues they found meaningful “The ‘Moms for Martha’ tour  in particular  is an opportunity for moms and women to talk about what is important is to them ” he added Political tours are  of course  not limited to Massachusetts — Scott Brown has made recent stops on an “Honoring Our Veterans” tour in his New Hampshire US Senate bid — and have been a part of the political firmament for many years  But in the race to succeed Governor Deval Patrick  they have proliferated Treasurer Steven Grossman  the third Democratic candidate for governor   there are also three independent candidates and a second Republican   hasn’t missed the tour boat  so to speak  either  He held a recently concluded “One Commonwealth” tour  focused on job creation and economic development Spokeswoman Chandra Allard said the tour took Grossman to stops related to its theme  but his “message is the same regardless of where we are ”Although it has no catchy name  Grossman has also been on something of a permanent ice cream tour since his campaign for state treasurer four years ago An aficionado of frozen dairy treats  Grossman began a tour of ice cream shops around the state on the first day of spring in 2010 and has not stopped  Allard said  meeting potential voters for his gubernatorial bid at assorted ice cream parlors in recent weeks and months “This is where people go in the summer  and you can meet voters where they are  And ” she added  “there’s ice

played like videos in my brain  just before sleep  complete with deafening sound and visceral smell In one of them  the bombs go off and a pair of firefighters from Engine 33 and Ladder 15  Frankie Flynn and Mike Kennedy  bolt from the firehouse  like sprinters out of the starting blocks  and they are running  chugging  side by side  down Boylston Street  nThey come upon people lying on the sidewalk outside the Forum Lingzi Lu  a student from China who loved everything about Boston  is lying there  dead  Eight year old Martin Richard from Dorchester is lying there  dead  His little sister Jane is sitting on the sidewalk  stunned  her hair singed  looking down at where her left leg used to be  Their mother Denise has blood seeping from her eye  their father Bill’s legs are shredded by shrapnel  their brother Henry’s soul is shredded by loss  Severed limbs lay scattered  Rivulets of blood meander into the cracks on the sidewalk As smoke lifts and eerie silence gives way to moans of pain and cries of anguish  Frankie Flynn and Mike Kennedy and a score of other firefighters  police officers  EMTs  and passersby go to work  tying off gushing legs  reassuring the wounded  saving lives Today  as we mark an anniversary neither of them looked forward to  Frankie Flynn and Mike Kennedy are dead  Frankie  lost to cancer  dead 30 days after his diagnosis  Mike  lost to duty with his lieutenant  Eddie Walsh  dead in a fire on Beacon Street last month  just a few blocks from where two bombs exploded on Patriots Day and changed everything And just when that image begins to consume me  when my eyes burn in the dark  the other image appears  It is Jane Richard  She is smiling  leaning on her crutches  She is wearing a purple Under Armour shirt and shorts  and she has just been fitted with her Cheetah leg  her prosthesis  and then Jane Richard is step dancing to an Irish reel again  and in that moment the dark gives way to the light  nWe have been in commemoration mode for weeks now  and there’s still another week to go until the Marathon  and I still can’t figure out if this is good  bad  or just plain necessary Is it too much  Too little  Is there a right way to recognize a terrible wound  a wound that is as psychic as physical To get some perspective  I asked an outsider  someone trained in trauma  about what happened to us over the last 365 days  His name is Dr  Michael Barnes  and he is the clinical program director at the Center for Dependency  Addiction  and Rehabilitation  CeDAR  at the Anschutz Medical Campus at the University of Colorado Hospital in Aurora  Colo After a former student opened fire in a crowded movie theater in Aurora two years ago  killing 12 people  it was Barnes who went to explain what had happened to students at the University of Colorado School of Medicine  some of whom knew the shooter Barnes said that  like the cinema shooting  the Marathon bombings produced several different kinds of trauma  Those wounded suffered primary trauma  The loved ones of those killed and wounded suffered secondary trauma  as did the first responders  The wider community  the rest of us  experienced a trauma called compassion fatigue  overwhelmed by the images and stories we have all seen and heard “When we’re being traumatized  the part of our brain that truly remembers goes to sleep ” Barnes explained  “It’s sensory information that triggers memory — smell  taste ”And sight Barnes said Boston is experiencing cyclical trauma this week “I call it CNN syndrome ” he said  “There’s a repetition of video  of images ”Many first responders were willing to seek help  Dan Linskey  superintendent in chief of the Boston Police Department when the bombings took place  went around the city  hugging his officers and  in some cases  ordering them to see a counselor But there was a different kind of therapy taking place  and we weren’t even aware  The compassion with which the wider community responded — from ordinary civilians like Rob Wheeler  a college kid who peeled the shirt off his back to save the life of a man bleeding out on the sidewalk  to the massive fund raising to take care of survivors — is why the dark images are giving way to light  Reading or hearing about selfless acts by kids who raised money with lemonade stands or those running to help the bombing survivors and other charities is literally making us better “Optimism ” Barnes said  “is at the center of resilience ”And so we feed off the survivors  witnessing their inexorable path toward normalcy  We rejoice when Adrianne Haslet Davis dances on stage  when Paul Norden gets engaged  when Jane Richard gets her Cheetah leg “Resilience is about connectedness ” Barnes said Whether we realize it or not  we are connected to those so badly hurt last year  to those who helped and are helping them  and it is seeing them get back to what they love and who they love that has healed so many And so  to answer the question  all these stories about survivors and people running to honor Martin Richard and Lingzi Lu and Krystle Campbell and Sean Collier  it isn’t too much  It is part of the healing process  It is part of the normalization process It’s normal  We’re getting back to normal Last week  two priests named Sean Connor and John Unni stood on a back porch in West Quincy  talking to a pair of young Marines Father Sean is the priest who comforted the Richard family after the bombings  Father John is the priest who comforted the families of Mike Kennedy and Eddie Walsh at their funerals On this day  the two priests blessed Sean Finn and Dan Keeler Jr   who are shipping out to Afghanistan  to do a job not enough people in this country appreciate It is just coincidence  or maybe it isn’t  that those young Marines are the sons of men who keep the city safe every day  Keeler’s father  a Boston police sergeant detective  saved untold lives last year on Patriots Day  keeping the ring road open so the ambulances could ferry the wounded to the hospitals  Finn’s father is a deputy fire chief  one of the best firefighters in the city  He saved untold lives a few weeks ago when he ordered everyone out of that burning building on Beacon Street After Father Sean and Father John blessed the two young Marines  praying that they will be safe in the year they spend in one of the most dangerous corners of the world  they said their goodbyes to the Finn and Keeler families Sue Finn  the young Marine’s mother  has a tradition that any guest invited into her house must dance in her kitchen before he or she leaves  It is a reminder that life is too short  too priceless  to not dance  to not express joy  and with Sue Finn there are no exceptions  Not even for priests  So Father Sean and Father John dutifully obeyed  dancing a jig that would have made an Irish step dancer named Jane Richard smile And so on this day  when we pause to remember the boom and the smoke and the screams on Boylston Street  we also should  like Sue Finn  like Jane Richard  like Father Sean and Father John  remember that life is too precious and too short not to dance', '2014_12')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no

said he is open to reviewing the council’s final proposal  but will not sign off on boosting council salaries from $87 500 to $112 500  t n“In its current form  I don’t find this proposal acceptable  and I won’t support it ’’ Walsh said in a statement Council President Bill Linehan  who proposed the raise last month  could not be reached Tuesday to respond to the mayor’s veto threat  Last month  Linehan proposed a 29 percent increase for himself and his colleagues  saying the council had not received a raise in eight years Walsh must sign off on any pay raise  But two thirds of the council could vote to override the mayor’s veto Walsh came into office in January and pledged a new era of cooperation with the council  which had been dominated by Mayor Thomas M  Menino  A showdown over the proposed raise could fray the relationship between the new mayor and the council   nThe council is expected to take up the pay raise at Wednesday’s weekly meeting  and councilors will have the opportunity to amend the proposal  Although it appears that a majority of the 13 councilors supports the raise  a handful objects to its size Linehan initially pressed for a raise this year  but the State Ethics Commission raised concerns  Councilors are prohibited from participating in matters involving their financial interest  including a pay raise  according to the state ethics law Linehan then agreed to delay the raise until after January 2016  after the next City Council election Councilors received their last raise in 2006  which extended to the next year  increasing their pay to $87 500  from $75 000  Linehan and other councilors have maintained that the proposal would give them the same salary adjustments as given to the majority of unionized city workers But city data released Tuesday shows a 29 percent raise would increase councilors’ salries more than than those of other municipal employees   nCity workers received raises amounting to an average of 2 7 percent a year under contracts that stretched from July 2007 to June 30  2016  The measure proposed by Linehan would amount to a 3 2 percent annual increase for councilors over the same period  the city data show The proposed increase would be slightly higher than was given to firefighters  whose contract called for an average annual pay increase of 3 1 percent  according to city figures  The contract for patrol officers called for a 2 8 percent annual pay increase In addition  the council’s proposed increase would top the 2 4 percent average annual pay increase for other union members in city government In addition to Linehan  several councilors  including Councilor Frank Baker of Dorchester  indicated they would support the pay increase “I’ll support it no matter what ’’ Baker had declared previously But other councilors — including Matt O’Malley  Ayanna Pressley  and Josh Zakim — said they would not back a raise to $112 500 Pressley had argued the council should use the 2013 recommendation of the city’s Compensation Advisory Board as a guide for pay raises The compensation board in 2013 had urged an 8 6 percent pay increase for the mayor  thus bumping his salary to $190 000  The board did not recommend a pay increase for the councilors  Traditionally  councilors receive half of what the mayor makes  City officials did not act on the board’s recommendation',

stuffed a castaway spruce into a large mustard yellow garbage truck in Roxbury Monday  “You don’t get sick of this ”There was a catch  Monday was the first day of Boston’s two week effort to recycle thousands of residents’ trees  But Rigano’s team  one of five coursing the city in search of scrapped firs and spruces  was allowed to pick up only trees that have been removed from their stands and completely stripped of ornaments  tinsel  and other adornments  The rest end up getting picked up by a regular garbage truck and go straight to a landfill  which costs the city far more to dispose of  said Michael Brohel  the recycling coordinator for the city Public Works Department Waste Reduction Division The city recycles roughly 40 000 Christmas trees each year  Brohel said  which roughly translates to 1 200 cubic yards  or 240 tons But  he said  some 40 percent of the trees residents put out on the curb end up being picked up as trash The recycling truck can only take the trees from a neighborhood on its recycling day  and they have to be clear of what Brohel calls “contamination ” meaning trees left out with stands  decorations  or stuffed in bags that make it impossible to grind them into usable mulch “You have to do two things right ” Brohel said The recyclable trees are hauled off to the city’s compost site on American Legion Highway  There  yard waste collected in the fall  composed primarily of leaves  was stacked Monday in about 2½ acres of neat rows  This compost will be distributed to community gardens throughout the city  and the surplus is sold to offset costs The mulch from last year’s recycled Christmas trees has been used to cover the site’s perimeter  nto protect the compost from invasive weeds and prevent soil erosion Bruce Fulford — president of City Soil   Greenhouse Co   a private company contracted to operate the site — indicated a small pile of Christmas trees  the first batch of this year’s haul  Although most of them were clean  he said  a few still contained ornaments that may have escaped the haulers’ eyes Leftovers like these are what makes it difficult to recycle the discarded trees into higher quality mulch for city gardening  Fulford said  But  he added  all of the mulched trees will find a use at the site “Either way  it’s out of the waste stream ” Brohel said', '2014_994')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article',

minute detail is seen to  down to providing pictures of signs found in foreign subways  Many travel agents and tour guides have arrangements with the hotels  guides  and companies used in their trips and can vouch for the experience — or answer for any problems   These companies typically receive a commission from the operators their clients use   t nGrowth in the travel agency business is driven mostly by baby boomers  such as the Greenfields  looking for a more immersive experience from their vacations and able to pay for it  A two week Audley trip to Japan during the off season starts at about $3 000 per person  without airfare  but includes some hotel stays and meals  guided services  local transportation  and other services A more elaborate monthlong trip may include multiple excursions and meals  luxury hotel accommodations  and an overnight stay with monks at a monastery on the majestic Mount Koya  the birthplace of the Shingon Buddhist sect more than 1 200 years ago  for about $18 000 a person The steady business has not only prompted several travel companies to expand their offices in Boston  but also to offer more destinations Grand Circle Travel Corp   which offers group tours targeting consumers in their 50s and older  has added more than 70 employees in Boston since 2012  The company reports a sharp increase in baby boomers participating in small group travel excursions offered by its Overseas Adventure Travel unit In 2013  the adventure unit served 40 270 travelers  this year Grand Circle expects 49 000 customers and has added nine trips to its offerings — including Sicily  Indonesia  and Brazil  In the last decade  business at Overseas Adventure Travel has jumped 67 percent Priscilla O’Reilly  a spokeswoman for Grand Circle  said trips that offer opportunities for cultural immersion are particularly popular In India  for example  travelers stay in tent roof cottages  ride camels and elephants  and visit a village  local school  and a women’s cooperative during a 16 day trip  starting at $2 395 without airfare  A 13 day trip to Costa Rica can include visits to a farming cooperative or dinner with families in rural  out of the way communities  and start at $1 895  Some of the excursions are exclusive to the company and not available to outside travelers “This US population growth of boomers is really impacting the industry because you have this whole group of people that have the time and money to travel  which they didn’t when they were raising kids ” O’Reilly said Joseph and Diane Zinck of Dorchester have taken three trips with Overseas Adventure Travel  to Southeast Asia  the Amazon  and Morocco since they retired a few years ago  n“When we went to Vietnam and Cambodia  one day you’d be riding camels  the next day you’d be in rickshaws or on boats or barges ” said Joseph Zinck  a 67 year old former Boston police officer  “It’s really a cultural experience ”Zinck said he considers the cost of the trips he has taken — $8 000 to $10 000 per couple — worthwhile because it includes all expenses  from meals to lodging and airport transfers  nEarlier this year  Liberty Travel of New Jersey opened a 10 000 square foot flagship location in Downtown Crossing  The store marks the eighth location in Boston  the agency’s third best grossing market in the United States Clients typically visit as many as 20 websites before reaching out to make a purchase through the agency  said Karen Kent  vice president of marketing for Flight Centre USA  the parent company of Liberty Travel “The relevancy of the travel consultants is definitely increasing ” Kent said  “People want to come to us for validation and for the expertise and the security ”Audley Travel  the British company that just expanded to Boston  connects travelers with in house specialists who have traveled extensively or lived in the destination country and tailor trips to customer preferences  Vacations cost $3 000 to $50 000 per person Audley managing director Jacqui Lewis said the company decided to open a US office because it was seeing more American travelers visiting its website  She said Americans are become more discerning about how they travel  In a post recession era  many people who have the money to travel want to experience something unique  she said  “The beauty of tailor made is that you set your own departure date and pace at which you’re traveling  considering your own likes and dislikes and all of those things are important to you ” Lewis said The Greenfields said the trip Audley planned for them in Japan was not inexpensive  but they thought the value of the experience was worth the expense  The couple thought that as Americans they needed to visit the site of the atomic bombing in Hiroshima  and the company connected them with a guide whose father was sent to the area to help survivors after the attack  David Greenfield  67  described the experience as “very difficult to imagine or duplicate ”They aspire to visit New Zealand and South America and said they plan to use Audley again “We had no idea this was such a great option ” said Carol Greenfield  65  “But we’re sold ” n•  n•  n•  n•  n•  n•  n', '2014_51')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article',

attract enough patients to make the operation profitable — or break even The company is closing the hospital despite promising in a contract with Attorney General Martha Coakley to keep it open until at least 2017  Coakley’s office said last week it would consider legal action if Steward did not maintain an emergency room in Quincy “We have made clear that any efforts to close Quincy Medical Center must maintain emergency services beyond Dec  31 ” said Christopher Loh  a Coakley spokesman  “This is an important step in that process  and we are continuing our discussions with Steward ”The

be dogged by the ghosts of 2010  when she lost a special US Senate election to an empty barn jacket  Those four year old echoes can be pretty persistent Just ask Republican gubernatorial candidate Charlie Baker  who ran a dog of a campaign against incumbent Governor Deval Patrick that same year The thing is  Baker seems to be pulling away from his past  That awkward  galumphing  testy guy from 2010  That guy is not this guy  Angry Charlie has gone away  Say hello to Nice Charlie — the Charlie who Baker says is finally being himself Himself was impressive on a visit to Roxbury on Thursday  Just before lunchtime  he visited Haley House Bakery Café  in Dudley Square  He got a warm reception  starting with Nate Awan  who came out from behind the counter to give the candidate a long  hard hug  Awan was headed for a lifetime in prison or worse before Haley House gave him a job and a future  Baker had visited the café a while back  and he and Awan sat down to talk for 40 minutes   n“After that he’s one of my favorite people in the world ” Awan said  “He got to know me and who I was  and I told him about my life  Since then  Charlie’s my guy ”If a man like Awan considers Baker his guy  something is happening here  Robert Lewis Jr   who heads   which mentors black and Latino kids through baseball  says Baker has been listening to him for years  joining Lewis’s battle  The former Boston Foundation bigwig endorsed the Republican on Thursday “In politics  we talk about Ds and Rs ” Lewis said  “We don’t talk about Robert’s relationship with Charlie for eight years  I am a Democrat  but I support           the man and the leader who has been there for work I’ve done in the past ”Let’s not get carried away here  It’s unlikely Baker converted anybody at Haley House  and he won’t be peeling away many votes in Roxbury  But he is showing up in places he might have written off last time  and connecting with people Where the old Charlie might have bent over tables in this café  a giant man towering above  and freaking out  patrons  this Charlie asked if he could sit down  folded himself into a seat  and chatted about their concerns  He listened to patrons talk about the minimum wage  welfare fraud  OK  that’s probably a Baker vote   unemployment  underserved kids  He left the people I talked to feeling good about him  even though most said they probably wouldn’t vote for him  If he can do that in Roxbury  he will likely do a whole lot better in places like Quincy and Wakefield  And that should worry Democrats  There are plenty of ways to beat Baker  Democrats can point to his about faces on issues like the minimum wage and climate change  They enjoy huge advantages in registration and organization  They can hitch their wagons to Governor Deval Patrick  who still enjoys phenomenal approval ratings  But they’re going to be out of luck on the likability thing  Partly because no one in the field approaches Patrick’s genius for connecting on the trail  And partly because the Baker I saw on Thursday is no longer as vulnerable on that front Still  Baker has plenty of work to do Walking down Dudley Street with his entourage on Thursday  he stopped outside a new laundromat  “It’s the mayor  Hello Mr  Mayor ” one delighted woman yelled Baker went inside  where several women posed for pictures with him  If he attempted to set his new fans straight on who he was  they didn’t hear him “We will be voting for you ” said a starstruck customer  “We hope you stay as long as Menino ”Baker emerged  rela  and chuckling  genuinely tickled by the encounter “You

nutritional supplement company called Herbalife It is a company that recruits people to hawk its products  not available in stores  to their friends and neighbors  Some critics have complained that its vitamins and other supplements  which are unregulated  are worthless  and that its sales force is exploited  nThese “distributors” are recruited primarily in low income minority neighborhoods  They are required to pay $1 500 or more to buy the products before they can start selling  Profit is far from assured Jackson was asked to join the fight against the practice  He did so  eagerly  nBut Jackson didn’t understand the full dimension of the campaign until a bit later  when he got a call from the New York Times  A reporter was working on a story about how wealthy hedge fund manager William A  Ackman is betting big money that Herbalife would collapse According to the story  which appeared Monday  Ackman stands to gain a fortune if the company goes down  The lobbyist who approached Jackson works  he said  for Rasky Baerlein Strategic Communications  one of several firms hired to work in the nationwide anti Herbalife campaign “I didn’t speak to any billionaires ” Jackson said Tuesday  “I had no idea what was going on in that space  My concern is for the people who have invested $2 000 that they’re never going to get back ”Almost overnight  the anti Herbalife campaign became the rare Wall Street war that reverberates in areas like Roxbury and Chelsea  With varying degrees of awareness  activists discovered that their campaign against what they viewed as a neighborhood level ripoff placed them in league with a Wall Street tycoon whose company could reap millions from their activism The Herbalife business model has a reputation for leaving many of the distributors poorer than when they started “They never  ever earn back their initial investment ” said Gladys Vega  of the Chelsea Collaborative  a nonprofit battling the company  “What bothers me about this whole thing is that these companies focus onto low income communities — communities of undocumented immigrants  people who are vulnerable  and who become victims of financial fraud   nFighting Herbalife is a natural crusade for a neighborhood activist like Vega  who can reel off the predatory scandals she has seen in recent years in Chelsea Hedge fund manager Ackman maintains that he  too  is fighting Herbalife on principle  because it does harm  not because he stands to make big money if his bet against Herbalife pays off  If he wins  he says  he will give his gains to charity Some activists felt odd about that fact that they end up being allied with Ackman’s anti Herbalife campaign  After all  a hedge fund is the kind of outfit they would normally view with deep suspicion “Its unfortunate that  Ackman  is involved in this stuff ” said Horace Small of the Union of Minority Neighborhoods  “But the truth is that Herbalife  Amway  all these          folks are hurting people  They prey on poor people ”Whether Ackman’s company can take down Herbalife  we’ll see  The vitamin company has vowed to fight the effort to destroy its image  and maintains its products and practices are legitimate  not some sort of pyramid scheme  as critics allege But a growing number of activists and politicians seem convinced that the company is a bum deal for the people they care about  Whether red flags were raised by corporate lobbyists or families that lost investments  a highly unusual coalition seems to be taking root “If we continue to ignore the warning signs in our community  it leaves the door open for everyone to do scams  and for people to lose the money they worked so hard to gain ” said Vega of the Chelsea Collaborative  “If we are wrong  prove us wrong  If

model  the other a local basket case Many years of erratic leadership  unmotivated students  and low teacher morale dragged down Madison Park  In the spring  interim superintendent John McDonough vowed to get to the bottom of the school’s problems  But he may have gotten more than he bargained for  The intervention team appointed by McDonough came back with recommendations to terminate the school’s new headmaster and jettison a partnership with nearby Roxbury Community College  McDonough is refusing to do both  t nMadison Park headmaster Diane Ross Gary lacks the administrative experience to run a turnaround school  But she does know the ins and outs of vocational education  So McDonough is looking for an executive director to run the school with her assistance  Together  he believes  they can transform the culture of a school that lacks focus on student success  If he’s wrong  Madison Park will only sink further into the morass of mismanagement  The best formula for a quick reversal at Madison Park would be to attract students who are eager to learn a technical skill and are not just randomly assigned  No administrator or faculty member  no matter how talented  can run a specialized vocational school with students who show no passion for electronics  culinary arts  nursing  automotive technology  and other typical course offerings  To ensure success  Worcester

Madison Park fails to revive within three years  But why risk three more years of lackluster performance  A regional vocational school that draws from Boston as well as nearby cities and towns has a much better chance of attracting motivated students and teachers  “The burden on us is to ensure that it succeeds ” said McDonough  who believes Madison Park should remain under the control of the Boston school system  But with the start of the school year just weeks away  he is still looking for an executive director and has yet to implement strict admission requirements  It’s not a good start Boston’s hospitals  high tech centers  tourism industry  and other economic sectors would embrace the graduates of a well run vocational school  And future employers care only about the quality of

much sneaks onto TV  onto Starz  without the distortions of too high or too low expectations  It arrives quietly and will succeed or fail on its own merits  not on some high jumping  rim rocking publicity attack And the show does succeed  and beautifully  “Survivor’s Remorse” is a gem  a likable  smart  and wise single camera comedy that  despite its clunky title  is as smoothly produced as an effortless  fluid jump shot  Swish  Set in the world of pro basketball  it’s about race  money  family  fame  and the unexpected turns life can take   and it’s funny  too  especially when Tichina Arnold is onscreen  The premiere  Saturday at 9 p m   is a bit too concerned with setup  like most TV pilots  but the following three half hours sent for preview were terrific  t nThe story line is a familiar one  Rookie Cam Calloway  Jessie T  Usher   originally from Dorchester  signs a lucrative contract with a fictional basketball team in Atlanta and moves there with his mother  sister  uncle  cousin  and his cousin’s wife  Suddenly  Cam and Co  are living in a massive  light filled modern apartment with a deck the size of an airfield  glamming up for red carpets  getting courted by giant sneaker companies  and dealing with intense media scrutiny and rabid opportunists  Amid the big changes  Cam’s cousin  best friend  and manager  Reggie  RonReaco Lee   is the stabilizing figure  the karma conscious guy with the long view and the practical mind  “I will not let you be a cautionary tale ” he tells Cam As they enjoy their new affluence  Cam and his family quickly stumble into tricky situations  such as when Cam’s mother  Cassie  Arnold   proudly tells the media about having disciplined her son with  among other things  Hot Wheels tracks and extension cords  “Doting doesn’t show a boy how to be a man ” she tells a reporter  “I whupped him ” And they generally stumble out of those situations  usually not in the predictable way we’ve come to expect from watching sitcoms  but always with their dignity and humor intact  In the third episode  Cam is pushed into visiting a dying child in the hospital  which turns into a nightmare before it turns into a gambol with a clever little coda As Cam  Usher is just right — affable  a little immature  well meaning  But he’s more or less the straight man here  Erica Ash is hysterical as Cam’s lesbian sister  Mary Charles  or M Chuck  who is blunt and always on the make  And Mike Epps is a quiet but ongoing source of amusement as Uncle Julius  who finds opportunities with the women who are trying to meet Cam — and ultimately they aren’t disappointed  As Reggie  Lee expertly balances his role as voice of reason with his history as Cam’s playmate  They all fall in together naturally as an ensemble “Survivor’s Remorse” shares a few things in common with “Entourage ” which was about a young star and his pals suddenly living the high life in Hollywood  Cam’s family is his entourage  the people from his past who keep him real and to whom he remains loyal  But while “Entourage” had the internal compass of a teenage boy  “Survivor’s Remorse” has a low key but distinct moral sense  Cam and his family definitely celebrate their deluxe lifestyle  and we can feel their joy  no one wants a dour look at fame and fortune in a comedy  But the writers consistently have the characters recognize and respect what really matters to them  most of all family The show was created by Mike O’Malley  check out the fourth episode’s nod to “Glee ” on which O’Malley plays Kurt’s dad   and he gives the action a nicely realistic tone  He never lets the over the top jokes  including a raucous church scene  define the entire show  He allows room for sweet but not schmaltzy moments and takeaways about class  assimilation  and identity in America — something ABC’s new comedy “Black ish” also promises to address  LeBron James and his manager  Maverick Carter  are among the executive producers  and their experience in the specifics of the basketball lifestyle seems evident in the finished product The first season of “Survivor’s Remorse” is only six episodes  which is unfortunate — but which also may account for the sparkle and finish of each half hour  In this case  perhaps  less is more  n•  n•  n•  n•  n•  n', '2014_872')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article',

winning as a freshman when he came off the bench for a star studded squad  then winning again as a senior when he led the UConn Huskies on an improbable title run last month “He’s clearly a winner ” said an Eastern Conference executive  “The kid won two titles and he basically won this last one with everyone on his back  Everyone knew he was going to take the shots  and he took them and made them  That does go somewhere in the NBA ” t nIt’s unclear how much that success will ultimately matter to NBA teams  but Napier  the pride of Roxbury  believes winning is the trait they should rank above all others when evaluating him for the June 26 draft “At the end of the day  winning gets you whatever you want ” Napier said during the NBA Draft combine this week  where he’s trying to improve his stock with workouts and interviews “It gets your rings  it gets you more fans  it gets you everything an owner needs  everything a team needs  I think it should be No  1  Certain guys know how to win  certain guys understand what to do at certain times of the game and that’s kind of rare ”Winning has certainly helped his draft stock  especially after this past season  “He for sure moved into the first round radar ” the executive said  “And I think that he opened a lot of eyes — ‘OK  maybe this kid actually has seen the light and he’s a point guard and I can trust him running my team ’ I think in the past  it was always like  ‘I don’t know if I want him handling the ball because I don’t know what’s going to happen ’” t nA Western Conference executive echoed that point and said that it’s certainly admirable how Napier led the Huskies this past season “But when he gets in the NBA  he’s going to be going up against guys who are bigger and more skilled ” the Western Conference executive said  “I think he’s going to be more of a backup and maybe a fringe starter down the road  but I think he really helped himself this year ”An Eastern Conference scout compared Napier with Tyronn Lue and Howard Eisley  both of whom spent their careers as backups “He’s like a third point guard  backup point guard  depending on the matchups ” the scout said Can Napier adjust to being a backup “That’s going to be the big thing with him  seeing how he acts when he gets in the league and he’s a little brother again ” the scout said Napier knows his role will change at the next level “I knew once I get onto a different team  I’m going to have a different role  and I’m able to adjust ” he said One Eastern Conference executive raved about the 6 foot 1 inch Napier  even while saying that he’d be a reserve “Here’s the thing  Conventional wisdom will tell you that he’s not good enough  he’s not big enough  he’s not fast enough  he’s not whatever ” the executive said  “But he just wins  All the kid does is win ”“And you can look at how much better he got from his freshman year to his senior year  He just got better and better and better and became a better leader  telling people where to go  what to do  He put his arms around guys when he needed to  I’d love to have a guy like that in  the  franchise “Is he going to be your starting point guard  No  But he can be a backup  change of pace guy  He can definitely be that  And he’ll be fabulous in your locker room  I would not have any doubt putting the ball in his hands and letting him do his thing  He can make shots too  He has deep range “So when you’re able to do that  that’s fine  C’mon  man  That’s a big  big bonus  Plus  he’s tough  Plus  he’s a leader  You’ve got a lot of positives  With the negatives  people say the size and he doesn’t have the athleticism and doesn’t have this and doesn’t have that  I just think he’ll succeed ”As a four year college player  Napier is a rarity among potential draftees  many of whom left college after their freshman season  but his lengthy career means that scouts and others have been able to study his growth “The kid has come a long way ” said an Eastern Conference scout  “I’ve seen him play a ton over the last four years and always thought he was a very selfish  all about him having to score and not making players around him better  But clearly this year  and the last two months  something totally clicked  Something went on that he had never had before happen to him  and now he understands it ”What will Napier’s role be in the NBA “In your guard core  he’s going to be one of the five guards ” the scout said  “I don’t think you’re good enough with him being your backup  I think if he’s your third point  you’re pretty good ”The scout added  “Who knows  Maybe Shabazz will find a landing spot immediately and someone embraces what he does  but I think the ball has to be in his hands         There’s going to be some nights in the league when I could see him going for 18 22  points  if you give him 13 15 shots  which he needs  He’s always been a volume scorer  Hopefully he continues  and when that light bulb went off and he finally got it and what a true point guard does  hopefully he’ll continue that ”Napier  who said the word that best describe him is “competitor ” just wants a chance “I’m a guy that’s going to give everything he’s got each and every day  whether it be practice  whether it be in a game ” Napier said  “I don’t feel as though you can describe me any other way  I was never given much  I had to always fight for it  That made me who I am today  I feel as though if you give me an inch  I’m going to take another inch  That’s just how I am  When you compete for so long and you want something so bad  you’ll do whatever you can to grab it ”', '2014_449')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article',

Jabari Parker  either likely to go No  1 overall in Thursday’s NBA Draft  were in the same room  discussing their journeys to this point at a midtown Manhattan hotel on Wednesday  nHere’s what we know  Parker doesn’t believe he’ll be picked by the Cavaliers first overall and said he prefers to go second to the Milwaukee Bucks  If that is true  the Bucks need to grab Parker as quickly as possible  given their poor luck of late with draft picks and retaining franchise caliber players As for Kentucky’s Julius Randle  he admitted he skipped a second Celtics workout that included former Oklahoma State standout Marcus Smart  Randle said he did not skip it  nfor a video shoot with GQ magazine  as has been reported It appears Randle knows exactly where he is going  He spoke Wednesday with confidence  a swagger that wasn’t prevalent in some of the other prospects   n“The  first  workout with Boston went really well ” Randle said  “I shot the ball there good  too  kind of showed my versatility  As far as turning  the second workout  down for GQ  that’s inaccurate  That’s completely false  The GQ thing was 15 20 minutes  I could have did that today  As far as turning down the second workout  I don’t know if you would say I turned it down but it was my option to go or not  I feel like I worked out for them once  I had the longest college season of anybody  What was the point of me going back  They’ve seen me play all year ’’   nDepending on who you talk to  the Celtics are high on Randle  or are deciding between Arizona’s Aaron Gordon or Smart  An NBA source said the Celtics looked at the medical reports of Kansas center Joel Embiid  who would have been the No  1 overall pick if not for recent foot surgery   n nThe source said Embiid’s back  which caused him to miss the NCAA Tournament  was sound  but the foot issues could be a long term concern  The biggest mystery in the draft is where Embiid will fall  His representatives have not disclosed his medical reports to all lottery teams   nGordon was bright eyed and pleased Wednesday  having impressed during his workout with the Celtics  It’s apparent he would love to be in Green this fall and he is likely to be on the draft board when Celtics president Danny Ainge makes the choice But the consensus Wednesday was the Embiid injury has turned this draft into an unpredictable situation  Teams such as the Cavaliers  Bucks  Sixers  and Jazz need to win now  given pressure from ownership and fans Utah has the fifth pick overall  one ahead of the Celtics  and there is no clue which direction the Jazz will go  leaving the Celtics to ponder the possibility of Embiid  Gordon  Randle  Smart  or even Noah Vonleh of Haverhill This is what makes the draft so intriguing  It’s obvious some players walked into the media availability with promises from certain clubs  Others  such as Louisiana Lafayette’s Elfrid Payton  smiling brightly and sporting a bow tie  used his workouts to perhaps thrust himself into the top 10 He could go seven to the Lakers  eight to the Kings  or nine to the Hornets  He was thrilled after the draft evaluation process  That wasn’t the case with Randle   who appears ready for the process to end It will be a memorable day for all of the prospects but by far the most popular player in New York City is UConn’s Shabazz Napier  who passed on entering the draft last year  won a national championship  and now is likely to be a mid first round pick NBA sources said the Heat  in their quest to retain LeBron James  have made a beeline for Napier and are looking to trade up from the 26th pick to get him  On a tour of the 9 11 Memorial  the Roxbury native handled himself like he did on the court  smiling in selfies with fans and signing autographs Finally  on the

Marty Walsh stood on the Greenway last Thursday and cut the ribbon on the Radian  a new 26 story  240 unit luxury apartment tower at the edge of Chinatown  it was his second development ceremony in the neighborhood in three days  He’d just broken ground on a 67 unit affordable housing complex around the corner  and if Walsh looked straight ahead while wielding his shiny pair of ceremonial scissors  he was staring at a crane belonging to a 312 unit mi  income complex that’s rising blocks away   nThis construction boom isn’t doing much to ease the city’s chronic housing woes  though  The  development spree might have been enough to fill up on  if Boston still looked like it did 15 years ago  It doesn’t   nBoston is a city bursting at the seams right now  It’s been almost a century since the last time Boston was growing as quickly as it’s growing now  For a slow growth state like Massachusetts  this is a great problem to have — as long as local and state officials recognize how unique Boston’s current boom is  and do something to avoid smothering it  Boston gained as many new residents between the beginning of 2010 and the middle of 2013 as it did in the entire decade between 2000 and 2010  The city’s population gains over the past three plus years are roughly double what they were during the entire 1990s  Boston is now growing more quickly than New York City  Chicago  San Francisco  San Diego  or Los Angeles  The new population figures  released last week by the US Census Bureau  also show that Boston is pacing growth for the state — something that hasn’t happened in a century  Generations of Massachusetts residents grew up in a steadily growing state that had a stagnant  or shrinking  capital city  That dynamic has been reversed  Many suburbs are scuffling along now  and wide swaths of the western part of the state are emptying out  Massachusetts’ growth is now an urban kind of growth  and it’s centered around Boston  Policymakers aren’t used to dealing with a rapidly swelling Boston  They’re going to have to adapt quickly  if they don’t want to squander the best thing Massachusetts has going for it right now Up until now  Boston has been throwing luxury apartment towers at its population growth  There’s nothing wrong with luxury units  but they can’t be all anyone builds  Boston developers are going to have to start building large numbers of new homes at rents that working people can afford  Walsh said Thursday his administration is putting its shoulder into a new working class housing push  Quick growth should also put new urgency behind long term efforts to open up development in the vast parking lots around Sullivan Square  the empty Beacon Park rail yard in Allston  and along the Fairmount corridor in Dorchester and Mattapan  These types of development frontiers have previously taken years  or decades  to prepare  Even if the current pace of housing construction is faster than anything the Boston residents are used to seeing  it’s not nearly enough  According to Census data  Boston issued fewer construction permits in the past three years than either Seattle or Denver  two similarly sized cities  issued in 2013 alone  The difference in pace goes a long way toward explaining why housing prices are spiraling out of control so quickly in and around Boston  In the past three years  home prices have jumped by 24 percent in Boston  27 percent in Cambridge  and 28 percent in Somerville  according to Zillow data  These price spikes won’t relent unless Boston starts pushing housing projects out the door more quickly  And the exorbitant costs of building downtown mean that heavy lifting is going to have to come in Boston’s neighborhoods  The strong anti development bent that dominates many city neighborhoods is going to have to bend  or else this huge influx of new residents  and the supply demand curve  will break Boston’s middle class', '2014_109')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no

loss to the Heat  the Celtics are the ninth seed in the Eastern Conference  a half game behind the Nets The newest Celtics —     and — said at their news conference Friday that they fully expect to foster the Celtics’ postseason push  and agreed  The Celtics have no intention of tanking  t n“I can look around the room and honestly tell you that nobody in here enjoys losing and nobody wants to lose ” said Sullinger  in his third season with the Celtics  “And nobody wants to lose on purpose  That’s never going to be our goal  We want to make the playoffs  We want to be able to make a push  and I believe we have a great group of guys in there to do that ”When asked if he was irritated by those who consider the Celtics a lottery team without   Sullinger said  “Yeah  it definitely upsets me  Although  Rondo  was one hell of a playmaker  we just have to change the game and play the way we need to play  It’s definitely going to be a fun challenge  At the end of the game  end of a quarter  to get somebody going  we don’t have to pitch  the ball  out to one person  to facilitate   we have a whole team to get our offense going ”The question is how long it will take the new players to become acclimated  On Sunday  Nelson was the first point guard off the bench to relieve   and Crowder and Wright made their Celtic debuts together to begin the second quarter  Crowder at small forward and Wright at point forward Nelson was 1 of 6 for 3 points with 3 assists  2 rebounds  and 2 turnovers in 20 minutes  Wright tallied 6 points and three rebounds in 13 minutes  and Crowder grabbed two rebounds in seven minutes The revamped Celtics are loaded with players who have played significant minutes this season  leaving coach the difficult responsibility of assigning playing time   n“You could argue for 11 to start  probably ” Stevens said  “That’s a good thing  We can’t let our depth become something where  as we figure this out  becomes a detriment  Our depth has to be a great strength  I feel good about us moving forward  We’re going to have to be a team in the truest sense of the word ”  nSmart got his first NBA start and had 3 points  4 rebounds  4 assists  and 2 turnovers in 28 minutes  He is not a natural point guard  but the Celtics have been pleased with his development at the position  He has a 2 1 assist to turnover ratio  and has proven to be a strong defender and capable passer After Rondo was traded to the Mavericks on Thursday   nstarted at point guard in Friday’s 114 98 win over the Timberwolves “I thought the other day the starting group played pretty well and Marcus was a little bit more comfortable himself as a point instead of playing off of the ball ” Stevens said  “And I think Evan’s versatility allows him to play with anybody  Evan’s going to play a lot ”Turner had 7 points and three assists in 26 minutes against the Heat   nThe Celtics drafted Smart sixth overall in June  and the moment he became a Celtic  the feeling was he was picked to replace Rondo  Smart played shooting guard and even some small forward in college  but the Celtics  nlike his ballhandling skills “That’s what he’s basically been most of the time ” Stevens said of Smart as a point guard  “We’ve got what I consider multiple guys who are combos that can play both  positions  but three guys who are point guards first  We’ll see how these guys complement each other  We’re all guessing a little bit with the new guys ” nRookie made the trip and participated in noncontact drills at shootaround  an indication his separated right shoulder is feeling better  Young was injured during a NBADL game Dec  10 and could be back by the end of the month   n“Hopefully he’s cleared for physicality if the rehab continues to go well ” Stevens said  “We still have to decide if he’s going to be good once contact happens ” nStevens said he will not pick a team captain to replace Rondo  has been with the team the longest  while   at 28  is the leading scorer and most established player  “That stuff sorts itself out over the long run ” Stevens said  “One of the things that great teams do is everybody takes ownership  We’re going to figure that stuff out ”         Miami’s missed the game after bumping knees with Wizards center  non Friday   nmissed his fifth straight game with a left calf strain  Coach said Bosh could play

was horrified as her friend instead slumped over and fell into her lap  She was covered in blood Headley  29  testified in Suffolk Superior Court Wednesday morning about the Dorchester shooting that killed Palmer — Headley’s childhood friend — 20 year old Shakora Gaines  and Anthony Peoples  a 19 year old who had joined the women the night of March 28  2009  for what was supposed to be a night of dancing All four were in Palmer’s Nissan leaving an after hours party on Mt  Ida Road when a man in a white shirt fired nine shots into the sedan  Only Headley  a mother of three  survived  Sometimes calm  sometimes weeping  Headley testified for about an hour about the events that led up to a burst of violence that seemed to come out of nowhere Keron Pierre  29  is on trial on first degree murder charges in the three killings  The  40 caliber handgun that was used to kill the young friends was never recovered  and there is no physical evidence tying Pierre to the crime  Pierre’s defense attorney  John Tardiff  has argued to the jury that Pierre is being falsely accused for a crime committed by another man who was with him at the party that night Headley  who said she never saw the killer’s face  did not identify Pierre in court as the shooter  But she said the gunman was wearing a white tank top  a description that matches those of other eyewitnesses who said they saw Pierre wearing something similar Headley  Gaines  and Palmer had driven to Boston from Brockton on March 28 to go dancing at Boston nightclubs  They picked up Peoples and later a friend of his  The group had heard of three after hours house parties going on that night in Boston and decided to go to the one on Mt  Ida Road Around 4 in the morning on March 29  the women decided to leave They and Peoples left but realized they had left Peoples’s friend behind  so they turned back The car was stopped at a stop sign when someone knocked on the passenger side window and motioned at Peoples  It was a man who asked him what street in Boston he was from  a question that is often a precursor to violence — gang members in certain parts of the city will shoot at young men with no gang ties simply because they are from rival territory Peoples answered  then told the man they were not looking for any trouble  The man left them alone But the group was unnerved  As they approached the Mt  Ida house where the party had been  a group of four or five men walked directly in front of the car  forcing Palmer to step on the brakes to avoid hitting them One of the men peered into the car and began trying to flirt with the women “What’s good  ladies ” he asked  Headley testified that the women just looked at each other and said nothing “They’re good ” Peoples told the man  then asked him to back away from the car “What  expletive   We’re strapped ” the man said  indicating that they had guns Before Peoples and the women could react  a man wearing white began shooting at the car When the shooting was over  Headley managed to get out of the car and hide behind a van  She made her way back into the house to get help  her clothes covered in blood  Later  police discovered two bullet holes in her jacket  but she was unhurt During Headley’s testimony  she frequently referred to Palmer as “Dee Dee ” a nickname Palmer’s father  Michael Palmer  sat in the front row of the courtroom  crying as he listened to Headley “Hearing her called by that name  Dee Dee  it brings back memories ” Palmer said outside the courtroom after Headley finished her testimony Dee Dee was the nickname her brother gave her when they were children “He couldn’t say her real name ” Michael Palmer said Chantal Palmer was boisterous  talkative  a little loud sometimes  and fun loving “She just loved life ” said her

different direction ” said Kate Norton  a spokeswoman for Mayor Martin J  Walsh  City officials had said Radius was large enough to house nearly all the addiction recovery programs that were on the

for new options  but they worry they will face similar obstacles elsewhere “It’s discouraging and disappointing ” said Jonathan Scott  president of Victory Programs  which lost 47 beds for women in a

companies behind half the country’s mortgages last week  Attorney General Martha Coakley’s decision to sue Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac  the nationalized mortgage giants  is a preemptive strike meant to defend the state’s tough foreclosure prevention laws  It’s also a serious uphill slog  Chicago was the last government to take on Fannie and Freddie  and it lost the fight badly  The odds are stacked against any state or city that guns for Fannie and Freddie  The companies have become extra legal institutions since they were bailed out and nationalized in 2008  It’s not obvious that the state has the law on its side  but that’s what makes the public act of taking on Fannie and Freddie in a Boston courtroom so important  The nationalized mortgage giants need to be shamed into doing the right thing  because it’s not clear they can be reined in any other way   nThe federal takeover of the two companies was supposed to be temporary  but Congress can’t agree on what to do with Fannie and Freddie  and their outright government ownership means that the companies are far more powerful now than they were before the housing crash  They’ve spent the years after their bailout running roughshod over the taxpayers that own them  They’ve pulled tricks big banks wouldn’t dream of trying  and fle  their muscles simply because they can  The city of Chicago mounted the last serious bid at restraining Fannie and Freddie  in a fight that began in late 2011  At the time  the city was overrun by foreclosed properties that were radiating blight  So the city enacted a tough ordinance that established a citywide database of vacant properties  required that banks keep the properties they’d taken from homeowners in good condition  and levied stiff fines against lenders that didn’t comply  Fannie and Freddie responded by suing Chicago  arguing that their nationalization made them exempt from local regulations and levies  A federal judge agreed  Fannie and Freddie later agreed to voluntarily register their vacant properties with Chicago  but the message behind the legal challenge was clear  The companies believe they’re above the law  until they decide otherwise The lawsuit Coakley filed last week is the most aggressive bid at reeling in Fannie and Freddie since the Chicago fight  Coakley’s lawsuit made Boston the front line in a years long  nationwide effort to humanize the approach Fannie and Freddie take to foreclosures  At first blush  it looks like it’s up against the same kind of hurdles that doomed Chicago’s attempt to regulate the companies  But the state doesn’t necessarily have to win in court to effect change  In picking the public fight   nCoakley is opening a window on the absurdity of a federal housing apparatus that won’t hold itself to the same standards it sets for others  Mortgage principal forgiveness and nonprofit led buybacks are at the heart of a $25 billion foreclosure relief settlement that federal officials forced on the country’s biggest banks two years ago  But Fannie and Freddie refuse to follow suit  They’re currently in federal court  fighting a lawsuit brought by a Dorchester homeowner who claims that Freddie Mac’s years long refusal to sell his foreclosed home to a local nonprofit violates a 2012 Massachusetts foreclosure prevention law  The nonprofit  Boston Community Capital  sells foreclosed homes back to their former owners  Fannie and Freddie have a blanket policy against selling to entities that are engaged in foreclosure buybacks  but Massachusetts law explicitly forbids owners of foreclosed properties from attaching any conditions to the sale of a foreclosure when dealing with nonprofits  Lawyers for Freddie have been fighting the Dorchester case on narrow legal grounds  but court filings show Freddie representatives idly threatening to sue to overturn the Massachusetts law  Coakley’s lawsuit makes a preemptive strike against such a challenge  It throws needed light on the rules Fannie and Freddie make for themselves  And  hopefully  it will shame them into behaving', '2014_752')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article',

football  Now there is the glory of God It’s Sunday morning  and all eyes at the New Jerusalem House of God are on Elder Pastor Irving Fryar  the former Patriots All Pro wide receiver who played 17 NFL seasons with four teams before becoming an ordained minister To watch him preach is like watching the late  great James Brown perform  He has to use a purple washcloth several times to mop the sweat from his face  But if he’s sweating his latest scrape with the law  you’d never know it  The State of New Jersey vs  Irving Fryar could be his toughest matchup yet In October  Fryar  51  was indicted by a New Jersey state grand jury along with his mother  Allene McGhee  72  on second degree charges of conspiracy and theft by deception  On Jan  21   both pleaded not guilty at their arraignment in Burlington County  N J   Superior Court to charges they conspired to steal more than $690 000 in an elaborate New Jersey mortgage scam  Fryar faces a five  to 10 year state prison sentence plus full restitution if convicted Their defense lawyers say they were victims of a broker’s scam  Before his church sermon  he is asked if he is a victim   n“I have nothing to say about that ” says Fryar  “My lawyer told me not to talk about the case   n“Now you have to excuse me  I have a sermon to prepare ”Later in the day  the reporter makes a second attempt to talk to Fryar  this time about religion and football   n“Don’t start ” he says  nOn this day  Pastor Fryar celebrates the first Annual Men’s Day  and the church will be packed for the late afternoon service  Lord knows he never mentions his arraignment in church on Sunday Fryar is no stranger to trouble  especially in New England  There were drugs  alcohol  gun arrests  fights  a car accident  and lies  In 1986  he missed the AFC Championship game after he sustained cuts on his hand in a domestic dispute with his pregnant wife and then lied about it  He returned to play in the Super Bowl and scored the only touchdown in a blowout loss to the Chicago Bears  Sports Illustrated once called him the “All Pro screw up  the Human Incident  and the Original Sinner ” Wade Boggs declared himself the “White Irving Fryar” after he fell out of a Jeep driven by his wife in spring training   nThen in 1990  Fryar gave his life to Jesus in a Roxbury church  and life got better  He became an ordained minister  and in 1998  he won the Bart Starr Award as the NFL player who best exemplifies outstanding character and leadership in the home  on the field  and in the community   nIn court  Fryar refused a plea bargain of five years in prison and was released on $20 000 bail  His mother’s attorney  Mark Fury  says McGhee was just trying to refinance her house and was conned  “This case arises out of a federal case where a third party during the height of the real estate boom made hundreds of shaky and questionable loans  frankly preying upon on the borrowers ” Fury said in court  “The feds leaned on this person to find names of two  or three  or five  or 10  others  that they could then pursue  The only name that was interesting to the feds was a famous name  Irving Fryar ”According to Fury  William Barksdale  of Levittown  Pa   owned a mortgage counseling business linked to a scheme in which he assisted families in fraudulently applying for millions of dollars between April 2007 and May 2010  Barksdale pled guilty in 2011 to a federal charge of wire fraud and was offered a deal to cooperate  Fury said  He is currently awaiting sentencing  Barksdale’s attorney did not return a phone call seeking comment “One crooked guy happened to do business with one famous name  and that’s what we’re being prosecuted for ” Fury told the court  “The victims here are these two ”Fryar was uncharacteristically quiet during the arraignment  At one point  Fury asked Fryar  “Were you No  9 all time in receptions when you retired “Five ” Fryar answered softly But the state attorney general’s office issued a statement after the October indictment  offering a different picture  “They provided false wage information on McGhee’s loan applications  falsely claiming she earned thousands of dollars a month as an event coordinator for Fryar’s church  Fryar himself allegedly received or spent more than $200 000 of the fraudulently obtained loan proceeds  Fryar and McGhee made only a few payments on four of the loans  and those banks eventually wrote the loans off as losses ”  nNew Jersey Acting Attorney General John Hoffman added  “This is not a case in which Mr  Fryar and his mother simply omitted or misstated information on loan applications ”  nReached for comment  Michael Gilberti  Fryar’s lawyer  said he is currently going through 5 000 pages of documents of discovery  “All I can tell you is that Irving has denied making any money from Barksdale’s mortgage fraud scheme ” he said  “He didn’t receive any money as a result of Barksdale’s mortgage fraud scheme ”Gilberti also said Fryar did not know about the multiple applications at different banks “Nope ” he said  “He has denied any knowledge of it ”But for some  the allegations themselves are game changing  Fryar was fired by Robbinsville High School during his first year as football coach   nBack at the New Jerusalem House of God  the spirit is loving and festive   nFryar  despite his legal problems  is well prepared for three separate services  He delivers his 40 minute sermon  “Being Da Man ” from memory  quoting scripture by heart  never looking at notes  When he gets to the points he’s excited about  he says  “Watch this ” as though he’s in the film room and knows Dan Marino is about to hit him on a fly route At the beginning of one service  he includes the Fryar family in a list of people to pray for “Lift up our brothers and sisters who we called up from our prayer list ” he says  “They are in need  God  they are in need of you “God  this is not a selfish prayer  though yes we  too  do need prayer         to ask you  God  to meet every one of their needs         To take that which is crooked and make it straight ’’Fryar  dressed in black with a purple bow tie and matching silk handkerchief  says he loves to stay in church all day No one in the congregation breathes a word of Fryar’s arraignment  But a reporter is told that he is not allowed to ask the congregation any questions about Fryar or he will be escorted from the premises by the well dressed security  No photographs  either Meanwhile the congregation sings  “Welcome to New Jerusalem ” to all visitors At one point  a woman and her two children respond to Fryar’s plea for people to be saved  The three embrace Fryar  They pray as one  Ushers pass out tissues and fans Giddy with joy that Jesus has saved three souls  Fryar goes off into a touchdown dance of joy “Your pastor is cuckoo for Jesus ” he says He also relates a story about how God told him he was a “knucklehead” for the way he treated his beloved wife Jacqueline  who sits right up front “We pray  God  that you will still the ripples of life ” he says  “Still the storms ”  nThe congregation urges him on  “Say it  brother

Students are anxiously counting down the hours until the school year ends Wednesday  But turmoil is engulfing Boston Latin Academy  one of the city’s illustrious exam schools  long considered a golden ticket to a college education In a letter sent to the interim superintendent  dozens of teachers raised a series of issues  accusing the headmaster and other administrators of lowering academic standards  penalizing those who refuse to comply  and otherwise “creating fear and insecurity amongst faculty ” nThey say  for instance  that teachers have been told to give out more As and Bs and swap out some classical literature for pop fiction  Often when teachers refuse to abide or raise too many questions  the letter stated  administrators seem to have targeted them for removal  stepping up classroom observations and writing evaluations that pick apart performance in nuanced detail and offer little constructive feedback to improve their craft  Particularly alarming  they say  is that some administrators appear to be developing a pattern  whether intentional or not  of pushing out older teachers and black teachers The faculty is scheduled to meet with high ranking school district officials Wednesday  more than three weeks after dozens of faculty sent the seven page letter  complete with an appendix of documentation about a half inch thick   nThis marks the second time in two years the faculty has sent a letter to school district officials seeking resolution to these issues  The Globe has obtained copies of both letters  without the pages that contained the teachers’ signatures “We write this letter in the hopes that you will help us to get Boston Latin Academy back on a path of excellence ” the teachers wrote in the latest letter  dated May 31 Boston Latin Academy  on Townsend Street in Dorchester  opened in 1878 as an all girls college preparatory school  It has long existed in the shadow of the better known Boston Latin School  which originally educated only boys  Both schools went coeducational in the 1970s  and students must pass an entrance exam to gain admission  Latin Academy educates about 1 700 students  nThe dispute is the latest controversy involving the district’s evaluation system  implemented two years ago to provide more rigorous oversight of teachers and administrators  Data released by the  School Department last year raised the prospect of potential bias  indicating that teachers who were older  black  or Hispanic were more likely to receive low marks During the last school year at Boston Latin Academy  the only unsatisfactory rating was given to a black teacher  while another black teacher received a “needs improvement ” the next step up  There were a total of 12 black teachers evaluated at the school that year  An Asian teacher and two white teachers also received a “needs improvement rating ” All five were 50 or older In a statement  Boston school officials sidestepped complaints about the possibility of discrimination at Latin Academy when responding to written questions from the Globe about whether the school was targeting teachers who were black or older with poor performance reviews or removal  Instead  they talked about the overall trends in educator evaluation data districtwide  saying “there are patterns we do not like to see ”“This is not a trend unique to a single school  to Boston or even education  but it is one that we must address in a transparent  equitable  and deliberate manner ” the statement read  “We are reviewing the data and the underlying issues with our Office of Equity  which monitors our recruiting efforts and all hires  We are also having open discussions about the potential impact of bias in evaluation ”But the statement continued  “recruiting highly qualified teachers who reflect the diversity of the student population has been a priority for the district ” The school district has also said it is training evaluators to be aware of any unintentional biases Interim Superintendent John McDonough declined repeated requests for an interview  as recently as Monday  through a spokesman  In a statement  McDonough said he wanted to keep the matter private “This letter was sent to us in confidence ” McDonough said  “We will keep our conversations with the authors private as we engage in productive discussions to move the school forward ”Latin Academy’s headmaster  Emilia Pastor  also declined comment when reached by phone Monday morning  her second day back to work after taking a three month maternity leave  Pastor took over running the school on an interim basis in 2009  ultimately gaining the permanent post In an e mail to the Globe  she said  “I would like to respect that individual evaluations are confidential  and my teachers expect me to keep our conversations about them confidential ”Among the issues the teachers are raising  race is arguably the most sensitive  Latin Academy has long been out of compliance with a federal court order that requires at least 25 percent of the faculty at the city’s three exam schools to be black  In fact  the percentages have largely been dropping in recent years Of the school’s 93 teachers during the 2012 13 school year  just 13 percent were black  according to the most recent state data available  That is down from 18 8 percent five years earlier  The school  however  is in compliance with thresholds for other racial and ethnic minorities Elizabeth Redley  an English teacher who is black  said the school administration put her under the microscope soon after she arrived two years ago  She said her first mistake was holding students after school for misbehaving without giving parents advance notice  as required  She said her relationship with the school’s administrators only deteriorated from there “When you are black and in a professional setting  you feel like you need to work harder and prove you are doing your job  but that’s not valued at Boston Latin Academy ” said Redley Over the last two years  five black teachers from Latin Academy were not rehired  representing half of all those who were not asked to return  according to data provided by the School Department  In previous years  however  there were no black teachers in this category Some teachers say the numbers tell only part of the story  the experiences of so called provisional teachers who are new to the system  There are also veteran teachers  they say  who have been pushed out A case in point  they say  is a black music teacher who arrived at the school in fall 2012  transferring from another school  The relationship between the adminsitration and the teacher  who had been in the Boston school system since the 1990s  was contentious from the start  the teachers said  claiming she was subjected to unacceptable public humiliation On Feb  5  2013  notes that the teacher’s supervisor took during a classroom observation appeared on the back of school announcements that were stuffed inside teacher mailboxes  The observation notes identified the teacher by name and at one point ridiculed the teacher for singing a question to her students  saying the approach was “juvenile ” according to a copy obtained by the Globe A few months later  the teacher left the school In its statement  the School Department said an office staff member accidentally used the back of the classroom observation notes to make copies of the school announcements  thinking it was scrap paper  saying “both the staff member and the school leader apologized to the teacher the next day ”“Administration would never and has never knowingly released any portion of a teacher’s evaluation for any reason ” the department said The music teacher  reached by phone last week  declined to comment on the advice of legal counsel The issues around lowered academic expectations tend to center around the English and math programs  In their May 31 letter  teachers said they have been told not to teach vocabulary or grammar to students  that junior and senior essays require no research  and that there are no history textbooks  The school’s administrators place too much emphasis on having students work in groups  they said  rather than receiving instruction from teachers Faculty expressed concern that the school’s standing in the US News   World Report ratings has dropped to 15th in Massachusetts  while another exam school  the O’Bryant School of Math and Science  has surged past them to ninth  Boston Latin School is number one “We are at best at this point treading water ” said one teacher speaking on the condition of anonymity  fearing reprisal Latin Academy  however  remains an academic heavyweight on the MCAS  All of its 10 graders  for instance  scored advanced or proficient in English  math  and science in spring 2013 on the MCAS  the second time in the last three years  n•  n•  n•  n•  n', '2014_42')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no

the state’s diversity  Democrats  Republicans  and independents alike speak proudly of their intent to embrace all communities and aggressively protect civil rights Yet despite the candidates’ campaign rhetoric  their paid staffs do not always reflect the state’s cultural tapestry  nThere are candidates with no black staff members  some without Hispanics on their payroll — at least one lacks both — and those who have not hired any Asian staff members Among the large field of candidates  Democrats Martha Coakley and Steve Grossman and independent Evan Falchuk have staffs that best reflect the diversity of the state  Republican Charlie Baker has a staff that is almost entirely white  Democrats Joe Avellone  Juliette Kayyem  Don Berwick  and independent Jeff McCormick fall somewhere in between Having a diverse campaign staff is not simply about checking boxes for the sake of political correctness  analysts say  it can also be critical to tapping into a broad coalition of voters in a state whose residents are largely white but which has significant pockets of blacks  Hispanics  and Asians in urban areas  They point to Elizabeth Warren’s Senate win in 2012 and Coakley’s loss in the 2010 Senate race as evidence Warren dominated the cities when she beat Republican Scott Brown and claimed a Senate seat  the same seat Coakley lost to Brown nearly three years earlier  And Warren did it in part by paying great attention to those cities’ communities of color  which often means having high level staffers who also connect with the community Political operatives say hiring people from diverse backgrounds is a challenge for campaigns  where too few people of color make their way up the political pipeline because they are underrepresented at the ground floor  Entry level jobs often come with grueling hours and little pay  a combination that specialists say makes it difficult to recruit first generation college students or those with heavy student loan debt  nStill  there is no excuse not to have a diverse campaign staff  said Kelly Bates  a specialist in political diversity  “At this point  in 2014  it is unforgivable ” she said  “But worse  they lose ”If a candidate goes to an event in Chinatown or the Vietnamese community in Dorchester or the black community in Roxbury or a working class community in Western Massachusetts  “the opinion leaders” watch to see whom the candidate arrives with  Bates said Even if they don’t know the candidate  voters want to see whom that person surrounds him  or  herself with  she said  “And we’re not just talking about a face ” she said  “but someone who understands the community ”Joyce Ferriabough Bolling  a political consultant dedicated to increasing the number of women and people of color in politics  said campaigns “are viewed as a microcosm of society  The folks who are running these campaigns need to be able to look at them like most folks who vote do ”Coakley’s campaign said she “learned lots of lessons from past campaigns ” including her failed 2010 bid  And while there were no black people on her paid campaign in January  three of her current 24 staff members are African American  the campaign said last week  There are also three Hispanics and two Asian Americans  according to the campaign Grossman  the state treasurer  has a campaign staff of 16  which in includes three blacks  two South Asian Americans  and one Hispanic  his campaign said Falchuk  the independent  reported having 27 staff members on his campaign  including 16 paid interns  as of two weeks ago  Among them are three blacks  one woman of African American and Caucasian heritage  three Latinos  and two Asian Americans Each first time Democratic candidate had gaps in the diversity of his or her staff as of last week  according to figures provided by their staffs  Kayyem had no Hispanics on her staff of 18  though a spokesman for her said Sunday night that a Hispanic staff member was recently hired  Berwick had no Asian Americans on his staff of 25  and Avellone has no blacks on his staff of nine All have championed diversity from the campaign trail Kayyem told supporters at a rally last month  “My career reflects what is best about our party  access and leveling the playing field with an equal commitment to protecting our communities and our children ” And Berwick  who often introduces himself as the most progressive candidate in the race  said at a March forum  “Government has an obligation to pass a moral test  We established a nation using words like ‘we’re created equal ’ ‘liberty and justice for all ’ ‘equal justice under law ’ u2009”Baker  who ran unsuccessfully against Deval Patrick in 2010  the state’s first black governor  has one Asian American among the 18 employees on his current campaign staff but no blacks or Hispanics  his staff said  At a rally just before the state GOP convention in March  Baker took to the microphone after the party’s Boston chairman highlighted the diversity in the room and said  “You need a state government  and we need a state government  that reflects the greatness of the people of this state ”Sarah Ann Shaw  a longtime Democratic activist from Roxbury  said she would expect gubernatorial campaigns to have more people of color on their staffs  especially given the state’s rising Hispanic population “I just wonder how and where the candidates get their representatives of color  Do they get them from other campaigns  Are they recommended ” she asked  “It’s important that the people they get know something about the communities they purport to represent  because if you don’t understand the community or who’s who  you could stumble ”When people of color are hired  diversity advocates say  it is critical that they hold key positions like press secretary or political director  Extending an employee of color’s responsibility beyond outreach to black  Hispanic  or Asian communities ensures that person is not professionally pigeonholed  they say “The candidate has to make a conscious effort  and in particular a conscious effort in Boston  because the field is not huge ” said Natasha Perez  who is Cuban American and the political director for McCormick’s campaign  There is one black and one Hispanic on his staff of 11 The people who surround a candidate influence everything from campaign messages to policy positions  They help shape the public discourse  their sway extending beyond the trail and into office “Just think about it from a policy perspective ” said Perez  who was a longtime Democratic strategist prior to being recruited by McCormick  “Any candidate does not have the answer on every single issue  so a good candidate reaches out to a variety of people  Staffs that are diverse just have a better mix of ideas ”Campaign organizations typically do say they want a staff that is representative of all of their potential constituents  so they can better connect with voters in those communities  But that’s only the first step in connecting with voters Activists note that in communities of color  campaigns often have to motivate people to get to the polls before they can start worrying about who is voting for their candidate  a process that takes money and time “To what extent and how much will they invest in those communities becomes the question ” said Joseph Feaster  an attorney and longtime political operative in communities of color  “Where are they going to spend their dollars  Where are they going to direct their advertising  Is the candidate seeking financing from those communities or doing meet and greets  Do you have an office set up there ”Because  Feaster said  “dollars are king  You follow the dollars  and that will tell you the influence that an individual or community has in that campaign ”', '2014_908')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article',

to combat the commercial sex trade in Boston  Not a single reporter showed up other than one who accidentally happened by  But now that he has the title of mayor  Walsh can expect a wider audience On Tuesday  Walsh is convening a summit on human trafficking for law enforcement  activists  and educators  The meeting coincides with a widespread shift in thinking about how the principle of supply and demand applies to prostitution  Rather than prosecute prostitutes  the new approach calls for greater targeting of the “johns” who purchase sex acts  Today  Boston Police are more likely to steer a prostitute to a job training counselor than a judge  And despite a dismal start in enforcing a 2012 law aimed at curbing demand  Suffolk prosecutors are starting to make cases against johns who are named  shamed in the local press  and slapped with $1 000 fines for attempting to buy sex  nConcentrating on demand makes good sense  The image of the happy hooker exercising her free will in a free market economy is nonsense  The women and girls who sell their bodies in Boston are likely to be under the control of pimps who use threats and violence to keep them working when guile and blandishments fail  Men who buy sex — whether from the street or Internet — are deluding themselves if they see prostitution as a simple commercial transaction between willing partners  Each transaction adds to the abuse of women  many of whom were pushed into “the life” in their early teens  There is no way to dress up this crime Forget the image of the john as the guy next door who is working through a period of loneliness or a rough patch in his relationship  It’s more accurate to compare johns with reckless drivers who weave in and out of traffic  unconcerned about the safety of others  When police delve into the backgrounds of such drivers  they often find criminal histories  The same appears to hold true with johns Demand Abolition  a Cambridge based group working to eradicate the illegal  commercial sex industry  commissioned a Boston area survey in 2011 showing sharp differences between men who buy sex and those who don’t  Sex buyers were more likely to have been convicted of a felony and outstripped nonbuyers when it came to possessing weapons  committing assault  and abusing substances  The abolition group recently teamed up with the Human Trafficking Unit of the Boston Police Department on a strategy to reduce demand for prostitution by 20 percent over the next two years  Human trafficking includes any form of commercial sex with minors and any coerced prostitution with adults  Yet the term often conjures images of women and girls who are smuggled across borders  In Boston  that is a relatively minor problem  Cherie Jiminez  who counsels prostitutes at the nonprofit EVA center in Boston  found only 25 foreign nationals among the 256 women served by the center from 2006 2013  Of the remaining 231  almost three quarters of them grew up in low income neighborhoods in Roxbury and Dorchester In February  Suffolk prosecutors made their first big case against two Boston pimps under a tough new law on trafficking a person for sexual servitude  The young women were not new arrivals from some exotic location  They were lured away from local rehabilitation clinics with the promise of free drugs If johns don’t care about the fate of such women  they do care about their own reputations  The Demand Abolition survey found that johns feared publicity more than fines or jail time  First time offenders deserve a chance to go to so called john school to smarten up  On a subsequent offense for buying sex  they belong on the state’s sex offender registry  If that were ever to happen  prostitution in Massachusetts would go the way of the dodo bird  Johns  for the most part  aren’t driven by some irresistible compulsion  Basically  they want sexual gratification without any sense of responsibility or back talk  Most of them will stop if the price of getting caught is too high  And unlike most prostitutes  johns still have a lot to lose  including spouses and standing in the community Walsh is a gentleman  He gets this  The summit is an opportunity for him to show how far he is willing to go to reduce the demand for prostitution in Boston', '2014_1061')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article',

four years of decline  the number of homicides in Boston spiked this year by 27 percent  even as shootings and violent crime citywide dropped As of Sunday  52 people had been killed in the city  compared with 41 by the same date last year  according to police statistics  Most of the homicides were in Dorchester  Mattapan  and Roxbury  t n“Even though the  other crime  numbers are great  we’re still looking at homicide numbers  and we want to make sure we get those numbers down ” Mayor Martin J  Walsh said in a phone interview  “I want to get to zero  I don’t know if we’ll ever get to zero  but we want to ”Fatal and nonfatal shootings throughout the city this year dropped from 250 to 213  a decrease of nearly 15 percent  Violent crime  including homicide  rape and attempted rape  robbery  and aggravated assault  dropped by 6 percent  and property crime  including burglary  larceny  and auto theft  dropped by 4 percent Since 2000  the homicide total in Boston has dipped as low as 39 in some years and  ntopped 70 in several others  according to FBI statistics provided by James Alan Fox  a criminology professor at Northeastern who studies crime trends  The number has declined slightly each year since 2010  when 73 murders were recorded Crime overall has been dropping for years  Fox said  and mirrors the slowing rate of crime nationally  In Boston  according to Fox’s database of FBI statistics using comparable population figures  the rate of rape has gone down by approximately 30 percent since 2006  the robbery rate has dropped by 46 percent  aggravated assault by 48 percent  burglary by 44 percent  larceny by 34 percent  and motor vehicle theft by 66 percent The reasons for the drop  he said  are many  cameras are everywhere  police use real time statistics and gunfire detection technology like ShotSpotter instead of hunches to guide law enforcement strategy  the population is aging  and many criminals are already in prison due to America’s incarceration policies  Emergency room medicine has advanced  saving gunshot victims from becoming homicide statistics  Also  he said  there was a crime surge in the 1980s and ’90s linked in part to crack cocaine and gangs  and so a portion of the current decline is a reversal of a bad trend “We are a much safer city than we have been for many  many years ” said Fox  “That’s true in many other places  too  We’re not unique ”In other major cities  including Chicago  New York City  and Los Angeles  homicide totals also dropped or held steady  according to local police statistics  As of Dec  21  Chicago had seen 392 murders  compared with 408 on the same date last year  New York City had 321 murders as of Sunday  compared with 334 at the same point last year  Homicides in Los Angeles rose slightly  from 250 as of Dec  27  2013  to 254 on the same date this year Sexual assaults rose in Chicago this year while robberies dropped  Rapes and robberies rose in Los Angeles while the number of shooting victims dropped  In New York City  grand larceny auto rose this year  while rapes  robberies  felony assaults  burglaries  and grand larcenies all dropped In Boston  the year began with a surge of killings  many gang related  In January  nine people were killed  in February  a 9 year old boy was accidentally shot to death by his 14 year old brother  nAfter those tragedies  said Police Department spokesman Lieutenant Michael McCarthy  the city made gun violence its focus  launching a gun buyback program and cracking down hard on illegal firearms  At recent count  the Boston force had taken 1 053 guns off the streets through the buyback and police work  he said  compared with 667 for all of 2013  nThe department has also focused on policing hot spots  putting extra patrol and bicycle officers in Dorchester  Roxbury  and Mattapan  Police held sports and academy programs for young people  and began scheduling regular coffees with police in the neighborhoods  Walsh said his administration also worked to place young people believed to be involved in violence into job programs The number of police involved shootings this year  and the number of officers injured on the job by suspects  were not available Tuesday  In April  police officers fatally shot a man who allegedly charged at them with knives as they responded to a domestic violence call in the South End Clergy and community leaders said that while this year’s rise in homicides was disheartening  the overall picture painted by the statistics was positive “One of the things that I’ve learned over the years is that the homicide rate can go up and down  but the more important number is shots fired and shooting rate ” said the Rev  Jeffrey Brown  associate pastor at Twelfth Baptist Church in Roxbury  “When you have a lot of people shooting  and shooting at people  whether they’re missing or not  it contributes to the violence in the community ”Emmett Folgert  executive director of the Dorchester Youth Collaborative  said nonfatal shootings are  in his experience  one of the best predictors of future violence  because the wounded person often seeks revenge “If fewer people are shot  then in the future we can expect less retaliatory shooting ” he said Still  52 families lost a loved one this year  some noted “I’m feeling a lot of grief for the city over some of these recent homicides ” said Mark V  Scott  associate pastor at the Azusa Christian Community in Dorchester  who performed the funeral for 20 year old William Davis after he was shot to death on Dec  17 on Dudley Street The young man’s sister lamented that her brother would not be there for his birthday  for Thanksgiving  for Christmas  and Scott said she did not know what to do with her grief  He praised police but said each

say  his victim fired his  357 handgun first  leaving Blake mortally wounded in the hall of a Washington Street apartment building Now  the two surviving alleged robbers  Jahleel T  Sanders Williams  17  and 15 year old Kevin O  Sanchez  are facing charges that they murdered their friend  even though neither one fired a single shot  nThe Essex district attorney’s office said state laws allows Sanchez and Sanders Williams to be charged with felony murder because Blake died in the April 16 shooting while the teenagers allegedly participated in another felony  They are both being tried as adults under a state law that requires anyone who is 14 or older and charged with murder to be tried as an adult “It’s not that Mr  Sanchez actually pulled the trigger  but that Mr  Sanchez participated in an armed robbery with at least a sawed off shotgun and possibly one other weapon ” Assistant Essex District Attorney Kate MacDougall said at Sanchez’s arraignment Thursday in Lynn District Court The who is a licensed gun owner  has not been charged with a crime  said Steve O’Connell  a spokesman for Essex District Attorney Jonathan W  Blodgett “It’s pretty traumatic ” said attorney Richard Chambers Jr   who represents the 24 year old Lynn resident  “He exercised two rights  He exercised his right to carry  and he exercised his right to self defense ”The shooter called the situation horrible  n n“I don’t want to relive that night ” he said by phone  The Globe is withholding his name at the request of prosecutors who fear for his safety Sanchez was ordered held without bail after not guilty pleas were entered on his behalf to charges of murder and attempt to commit a crime  He was arrested Wednesday in Lynn  said his defense attorney  Michael Osborne  who declined to comment further  Stephen Judge  another lawyer for Sanchez  did not return a call Sanchez told police he knew about Blake and Sanders Williams’ plan to rob someone they believed was a marijuana dealer  and he went with the older teens to his apartment building  But Sanchez said he stayed behind when his friends ambushed the intended victims  a police report said  nThe shooter denies he is a drug dealer  his lawyer said Sanchez told police that a short time after his friends went inside with the victims  he heard shots and ran home  However  witnesses said that Sanchez helped scout out the apartment building and the alleged victim’s motor vehicle In court  MacDougall said that Sanchez is involved in gangs in Lynn  She said he has been threatening witnesses to the alleged robbery and shooting by posting the address of a witness on Facebook  She also said Sanchez has a juvenile record from the severe beating of a young man  but she provided no additional details Sanchez’s mother was in court  but she left without commenting Sanders Williams  who was arrested last week  is being held without bail at a state Department of Youth Services facility in Dorchester  said his defense attorney  Edward L  Hayden  He pleaded not guilty to charges of murder and attempt to commit a crime  Hayden said “It’s really unusual when the victim kills one of the robbers ” Hayden said  “They can make an argument that it is a legitimate charge  I’ll be making an argument that it’s not  that you cannot infer an intent to kill one of the robbers when it’s the victim who shoots ”Sanders Williams told police that he was not armed  a report said The  told investigators he was approached just after midnight last Wednesday by a man  later identified as Blake  who put a shotgun to the back of his head and ordered him inside his apartment building  a police report said The alleged victim and a companion were allegedly held at gunpoint by Blake and another man  according to a statement given to police  Chambers said Blake and the other man  who was not identified in the report  were masked  The companion said the man holding him at gunpoint repeatedly said “give him what he had or they were going to kill both of them ”Once inside the building  the alleged victim managed to pull a gun from his pocket and fire it three or four times at Blake  the report said  He also called 911  the report said  and remained at the scene Sarah M  Ventura Firpo  who lives steps from where the shooting took place  said the alleged victim was out of breath on the phone and panicking after firing his weapon  “I cannot forget that ” she said  nEmi Martinez  who lives in the building  described the alleged victim as a nice guy “He would say hi ” she said  “If I had groceries  he would help me bring them up ”Blake’s mother declined to comment Thursday Sanders Williams and Sanchez are due back in court May 19', '2014_1111')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no

transparent Boston Redevelopment Authority is about to be put to the test His administration is seeking state approval to extend 15 of the city’s 18 urban renewal districts for another decade  allowing the BRA to use eminent domain powers  tax breaks  and other tools to shape development  t nNewly appointed BRA director Brian Golden acknowledged Tuesday that the authority has abused those powers in the past — by bulldozing whole neighborhoods in the 1950s and ’60s and more recently by being less than forthcoming about its financial dealings with developers and other parties But Golden pledged that the BRA will use urban renewal powers more sparingly in coming years to build moderately priced housing and promote business growth in neighborhoods  He also said citizens will have more input on zoning decisions and the use of public property “We will show people that we are a people’s BRA  not just a developers’ BRA ” Golden said in a meeting with reporters  “We will show them that with our deeds  not just our words ”The efforts to extend urban renewal will offer the first window on promises by Walsh and Golden to reform the BRA and change the way it handles development  In his comments Tuesday  Golden said the authority must work to improve the quality of the city’s architecture and neighborhoods  while continuing to pursue economic growth “If we do this well  we can demonstrate that we’re not just about getting big things built that enrich developers ” he said  “We can also get a more beautiful world class city developed that benefits people ”BRA officials said they will brief the City Council on its plans to extend urban renewal districts on Wednesday Most of those districts are set to expire in April  but the BRA will seek a yearlong reprieve to solicit public comment about how its priorities for those areas should change  Then  it will seek state approval to extend its urban renewal powers for another decade BRA officials said they will not pursue extensions for a small section of Allston and the area around the Ritz Carlton Hotel   Residences downtown because development goals in those areas have been achieved But it will seek to preserve urban renewal powers in 15 areas stretching from Charlestown to the Fenway  and to parts of Roxbury and Dorchester  Overall  the districts cover about 3 000 acres  or about 10 percent of the city Launched in the 1950s to revitalize blighted city centers  urban renewal ignited fierce controversy in Boston over the demolition of the old West End neighborhood  which was redeveloped into a series of high rise apartment towers  It also led to the creation of Government Center in place of Scollay Square  construction of the Prudential Center  and the revitalization of Faneuil Hall marketplace Federal funding for such projects dried up in the mid 1970s  but the BRA has continued to use urban renewal powers to shape development in the city  The authority has used those powers to take control of property  grant tax breaks to spur development  and alter zoning rules to permit larger projects in select locations In recent years  the BRA has used those tools to build the Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital in Charlestown and the Whittier Street Health Center in Roxbury  It also used them in the widely criticized deal to give the Red Sox a permanent easement to use Yawkey Way on game days Critics have accused the authority of using its powers to benefit certain developers or projects supported by previous mayoral administrations  Golden largely accepted that criticism on Tuesday  saying that the BRA should use urban renewal more judiciously and do a better job of explaining its policy decisions “People don’t think of the BRA as an agency with a soul ” he said  “They think of it as maybe a dark  menacing presence with tremendous power  and that historically that power hasn’t always been used wisely  We want to turn the corner on that perception ”The BRA’s last effort to extend its urban renewal powers in 2004 led to allegations of back room dealing between authority officials and city councilors  A Superior Court ruling found that some of those dealings constituted violations of the state’s Open Meeting Law But officials said Wednesday’s briefing with the City Council will be the start of a yearlong effort to rethink the BRA’s approach and create a more open discussion with affected neighborhoods “It will allow us to take a fresh look at the BRA and how it’s operating ” said City Council president Bill Linehan  “We need to fully understand how they intend to use these powers and see if the extensions are warranted ”', '2014_936')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no

are trying to keep the union from becoming extinct  But it will be hard to dredge up any sympathy from Bostonians  Nothing short of mass amnesia is likely to blot out the public’s memory of last October’s wildcat strike  which left thousands of children stranded on city sidewalks On Monday  about 200 drivers and their supporters protested at the Dorchester headquarters of Veolia Transportation  the contractor responsible for transporting 33 000 Boston students to and from school  The union is furious that Veolia fired five of its leaders after last fall’s illegal strike  Protesters demanded their reinstatement   t nBut the fired workers  it turns out  haven’t gone very far  Some of them  including firebrand Steve Kirschbaum  played significant roles in orchestrating this week’s protest  which coincided with the expiration of the collective bargaining contract between Veolia and the drivers Local 8751 has a special way of endearing itself to the city’s taxpayers  On Thursday  Boston Police filed a complaint against Kirschbaum in Dorchester District Court for allegedly breaking into Veolia headquarters during the demonstration and assaulting an employee with a dangerous weapon  For some ungodly reason  Kirschbaum remains a member of the union’s negotiating team School officials  meanwhile  are busy trimming the roughly $100 million school transportation budget  Come fall  middle school students will receive MBTA passes instead of service on yellow buses  The union has denounced the move as a “racist” attack on Boston’s schoolchildren  Actually  it’s a sensible plan that would allow the city to redirect about $8 million into classroom improvements There may be legitimate issues on the collective bargaining table  including hourly wages  health insurance premiums  pay periods  and leaves of absence  Drivers  who earn on average about $43 000 annually  deserve a fair wage and decent benefits  But it was galling to listen to speaker after speaker at the demonstration argue that Kirschbaum and the other fired workers were the real victims  not the pupils abandoned on the streets in October  Back then  the United Steelworkers called on its local to “immediately cease this strike ” But at Monday’s demonstration  the Steelworkers were peddling a pathetic story that it wasn’t really a strike after all  Richard Rogers  executive secretary of the AFL CIO affiliated Greater Boston Labor Council  derided Veolia as a French firm intent on “union busting ” He assured the protesting drivers that Steven Tolman  president of the Massachusetts AFL CIO  is “100 percent behind your struggle ” But somehow Tolman seems to be out of town whenever this marginal union mounts a demonstration  Good judgment on his part  t nSummer school starts on Monday  Parents of Boston school kids should be on alert  The bus drivers’ expired contract prohibited strikes  Now  with no agreement in place  the drivers could strike without warning or consequences Before he left office  former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg scrapped a provision that requires new bidders for school bus contracts to choose from a list of current drivers based on seniority and union pay scale  That’s food for thought  Boston Mayor Martin J  Walsh said he wouldn’t entertain such a notion  He’s as labor friendly a mayor as they come  But even Walsh sees red when it comes to Local 8751  “I have major concerns about leaving kids on the sidewalks ” he said Walsh  who headed the city’s unionized building trades before his election  said it is important for unions to “adapt and change ” Those that do  he said  are on the upswing  A case in point is Unite Here Local 26  which represents housekeepers  banquet servers  and other service personnel in 29 hotels in Boston and Cambridge  That’s up from just 12 hotels a decade ago  The union has added about 1 000 new members in Boston since 2011  according to Local 26 president Brian Lang  He attributed some of the union’s success to its willingness to adapt to changes in the hospitality industry and show flexibility around union work rules How about a little flexibility on the part of the bus drivers’ union  Instead of filing dozens of grievances  coddling its lunatic fringe  and ranting about injustices in far off lands  perhaps the union could see its way to extend and honor the no strike clause in the expired contract during negotiations on a new contract  Such a courtesy would relieve Boston parents from worrying that their children might be abandoned on the city’s street corners  And Local 8751  for the first time in recent memory  might actually appear levelheaded', '2014_887')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no

General Martha Coakley is the “wrong choice for governor ”And Coakley’s campaign was ready with a response  a 60 second Web video decrying the influence of outside money that it had waiting  ready for release when the first super PAC ad aired  t nThe ad by the Mass Forward political action committee  a pro Grossman group  says Coakley  the front runner in a three way Democratic primary  is not fit to be governor because she does not support Governor Deval Patrick’s plan to limit gun purchases to one a month The 30 second spot features four Boston area mothers holding framed pictures of smiling young men who are now all dead “We’re all mothers who lost children to gun violence ” says Clarissa Turner  who narrates the video  “My son Willie was murdered in a gang shooting  except he wasn’t in a gang  They thought he was someone else ”Turner says they all agree with Patrick’s plan as does Grossman but Coakley does not “She says it wouldn’t have any effect  She’s wrong  One less gun can save a life ” says Turner  looking directly into the camera while seated in a kitchen   t nGrossman  Coakley  and Don Berwick are all pushing to be the top finisher in the Sept  9 primary  The ad is a first in several ways  It is the first ad by the pro Grossman political action committee  which legally must function independent of Grossman’s campaign  An independent expenditure super PAC allows for unlimited contributions from people  corporations  associations  and unions  The ad also appears to be the first time in a recent Democratic primary that an outside group has funded a negative ad against an opponent  something Coakley’s camp has decried  “By refusing to sign a people’s pledge that would stop unlimited secret money from influencing this campaign  Steve Grossman has shown that he is a desperate candidate willing to compromise his values in order to win an election ” said Coakley’s campaign manager  Tim Foley  in an e mail  “Voters deserve to know — and Grossman must answer for — where this secret  super PAC  money is coming from and whether corporations or individuals doing business with the Treasurer are funding it ”On Sunday  Grossman’s campaign declined to comment on an unseen television commercial made by an outside entity  but Coakley’s 60 second Web video was a deft response in which the candidate never uttered a word  but instead had 10 voters condemning outside money being spent in the governor’s race The video starts by displaying a definition of a super PAC as a voice says  “There’s a new super PAC here in Massachusetts that is supporting Steve Grossman  Does that bother you ”Then voters respond “Super PACs do bother me ” one man says “All that money  Not sure where it comes from ” says a young woman Colette Phillips  one of the co chairs of Mass Forward PAC  said the Grossman ad would comply with all state disclosure laws  And  she said  should pending Massachusetts legislation to require real time disclosure of donors become law  they would abide by that  too  The PAC was founded by two of Grossman’s friends  Barry White  a former US ambassador to Norway  and White’s wife  Eleanor  who is president and chief executive of Housing Partners  Inc   a full service national affordable housing firm  The group recently spent tens of thousands of dollars for polling and media production  hiring Benenson Strategy Group in New York and Putnam Partners in Washington  D C  Both firms worked for President Obama “As Democrats invested in the future of our Commonwealth  we believe that gun violence is one of the biggest issues facing our communities ” Phillips said in a statement Sunday  “Steve Grossman will be a champion on this issue and take on the NRA to fight for the strongest gun control measures  Martha Coakley stood against Governor Patrick on a measure that would prevent guns from getting onto our streets  She’s proven that she’s not the aggressive gun control advocate that we need as Governor ” While Coakley might not

Boston Fire Department  but in making Finn chief  too In doing so  Walsh is returning the department to a tradition  abandoned under the previous administration  in which the commissioner is a working firefighter  and the chief is a working firefighter  and they are one and the same  a hands on leader who will not shirk his duties when the flames or anything else hits the fan  t nFinn is cut from the same cloth as another former commissioner and chief  Leo Stapleton  who might just be the gold standard in my lifetime  Neither Stapleton nor Finn — nor former commissioners and chiefs Marty Pierce and Paul Christian  for that matter — would ever send their firefighters where they wouldn’t go  and firefighters literally ran through walls for them As for the inevitable carping from some that Finn is too close to the firefighters union  Local 718  and will not be tough when tough choices have to be made  I would say anybody who thinks that doesn’t know Joe Finn Finn has his own ideas about how to make the department more efficient  more responsive to changing needs  He has his own view on scheduling and other work issues  He and 718 will not always see eye to eye  They will sometimes argue  The difference is  they respect each other  appreciate they will sometimes disagree  but through it all know they both care about the job and the people who do it  That is a massive change in the way things were done under the previous administration “Firefighters respect Joe Finn ” says Rich Paris  president of Local 718  “And it goes both ways  Joe Finn respects firefighters  and he expects a lot out of them  We’re both concerned about the safety of firefighters  of citizens  of anybody who visits our city  He’ll bring the job into the future ”I could sit here and tell you stories about Joe Finn’s firefighting and managerial ability  but it’s probably more illuminating to tell you about his character  It is one that was shaped growing up in Dorchester in a family of public servants  sharpened on Parris Island as a young Marine  honed at fires all across the city  in freezing cold and searing heat  t nI saw it in its most poignant form after his sister  Marie Conley  a great lady and Boston public schools crossing guard  was run down outside the Mather School in Dorchester and fatally injured six years ago  Marie Conley died while saving the life of a 10 year old boy who was about to walk into the path of a car driven by an 86 year old man named Anis Cazeau  who shouldn’t have been driving Even before he buried his sister  Joe Finn went to see the man who killed her  not to berate him  but to comfort him “I had to bring this guy some peace ’’ Finn told me all those years ago  “I told him  ‘Look  you didn’t get up this morning and decide to go out and run my sister over ’ The poor guy cried the whole time ”Finn and his family asked the district attorney not to seek incarceration for Cazeau  a Haitian immigrant who raised a girl  not his daughter  who became a Boston police dispatcher  Finn didn’t think Cazeau  who suffered a stroke a year earlier  should have been driving  but he had pity for the old man  not anger “What’s putting him in jail going to accomplish ” Finn said When the case got to court  Cazeau said little  but what he did say convinced Joe Finn that the mercy he and his family showed him was well placed “I wish it was me  who died  ” the old man said  “not her ”Finn gave his family’s impact statement  and he used it to ask lawmakers to force more drivers to be retested more regularly  to weed out more impaired drivers They ignored him  worried about the elderly vote  Unfortunately  character is not contagious  n•  n•  n•  n•  n', '2014_781')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article',

featured several political leaders  including Mayor Martin J  Walsh  US Representative Stephen Lynch  and state Senator Linda Dorcena Forry  as well as another Marine  Michael Ball  who also grew up near the cemetery Walsh called the commemoration one of “Dorchester’s greatest traditions ” He spoke eloquently of the sacrifices those in the military make to ensure the security and freedom of the United States “The lives of our fallen heroes run like a river through the history of our nation ” Walsh said  “All that we take pride in  all that we have achieved  and all that we hope for the future  it floats through these waters of sacrifice ”Toward the start of the ceremony  the organizers — who came from local posts of Veterans of Foreign Wars  the American Legion  the DAV and Amvets —

filled the streets with a rolling  joyous mix of African rhythms  nearly 100 people whose lives Ahmed Cook had touched — his parents and siblings  friends  colleagues  and pupils — formed a processional from Paige Academy to First Church in Roxbury on Sunday to celebrate his life As a boy Mr  Cook was a motivation for his parents   and the Rev    to found Paige Academy  a school in Roxbury for children up to age 12  As a pupil there  and then as an inspirational teacher of art  music  and kindergarten  Mr  Cook was entwined with the school since its founding in 1975  n nFirst diagnosed with cancer at 16  he lived to 42 and died May 25 in his Roxbury home  a couple of years after his illness returned  But the lessons of his life  from his music and paintings and pottery to his fierce determination to live  rippled outward far beyond the school and community “He belonged to the world ” his father said as the service began  acknowledging the wide range of Mr  Cook’s friends who filled the church  almost tripling the size of the procession  “and now the world is coming home to send him home ”A video on the  shows Mr  Cook drumming with Paige Academy’s pupils last summer  one eye closed forever by treatment for brain cancer  the other open and watchful  Transported  he arches his head back one moment and glances forward the next to survey the children with the gaze of a musician who seemed both of this life and of the next  n“He was a different person when he was drumming  It livened up a part of him ” Iley Alexander of Dorchester  who formerly was one of Mr  Cook’s teaching colleagues at the academy in Roxbury and whose daughter was one of his pupils  said in an interview before the service  “When he drummed  he would bring Africa to you  His eyes would close  his head would go up  and that was it  He was in a different world when he drummed and he brought you with him ”Sunday’s service celebrated Mr  Cook’s life with drumming and dancing  with singing and a saxophone medley of spirituals  His cousin Kimberly Cook of Atlanta performed interpretive dances  and one speaker encouraged the congregation to dance in the pews and aisles as the 1803 church was filled with the sound of Ziggy Marley’s “Love Is My Religion ” a phrase Mr  Cook embraced as a credo  n“Ahmed marched to the beat of his own drum ” his brother Israel  who lives outside Washington  D C   said when his turn came to address the church  and so did the service “Ahmed will always be a part of everyone in this room ” his father said  “and you will tell his story ”Ahmed Joe Cook was born in Cambridge in 1971 on Nov  29  his mother’s birthday He was the oldest of four children and “from the time he was a little child he had an amazingly powerful spirit  very artistic  very creative ” Kim Archung of Summerville  S C   a longtime family friend who was Mr  Cook’s first baby sitter  said before the service  “He was full of love and joy and he carried that with him throughout his life  Even through this long and arduous battle with cancer he had an amazing spirit ”Early on  she said  Mr  Cook announced that he would become a master drummer  He also took to art from the beginning  and years later when he returned to Paige Academy to teach  he brought with him his talents in music  painting  and pottery  his devotion to his African heritage  and his love of cultural diversity “He was always very super ambitious about art and bringing art into the community ” his sister  Paige of Jamaica Plain  said before the service “I think because of his illness at such an early age  he had a special zest for life ” said his aunt Maria Day Marshall  who also lives just outside Washington  D C   “and he appreciated every minute that he lived ”That was apparent to all Mr  Cook encountered  not least the young children at Paige Academy  which was named for one of his ancestors    n“I think that Brother Ahmed was a very good example of peace and happiness ” said 9 year old Marley Isaacs  who is Alexander’s daughter and had been one of Mr  Cook’s pupils  “I loved the year that I was with him  He was an amazing person  He was always true about everything he felt  and I miss him very much and I hope that he rests in peace ”Lamine Diallo  one of Mr  Cook’s teaching colleagues  said his pottery and paintings trail through the school’s rooms and hallways  A painting finished in the throes of illness was displayed at the front of the church Sunday  benevolently looking down at the speakers “You cannot go anywhere inside Paige Academy without seeing Ahmed’s work ” said Diallo  who added that “Ahmed liked to always give  He would do anything for the kids’ well being and happiness  We will miss him ”For seven years Mr  Cook was treated for cancer  into his early 20s  and he graduated with a bachelor’s degree in art and education from Fisk University in Nashville  which several of his relatives had attended Illness seemed certain to curtail his studies  but he was more determined to finish “He really always would not accept that the odds were against him ” Israel said before the service  “If you brought up ‘What would you want in your will ’ he wouldn’t address it  He would say  ‘I’m not going to die  Let’s talk about keeping me alive ’ ”Returning to Boston after college  Mr  Cook taught at Paige Academy the rest of his life “Brother Ahmed was a very optimistic person and very honest ” Marley said  “He never gave up on anything  He was always the brighter side of everything  That’s what made me just love the art of drumming  Even when he’s not around with us now I still drum ”Teaching and working with children at the school  “especially when he was teaching drumming and doing art with them  was like Ahmed’s calling ” Archung said  “His creativity  his patience with them  all came out so clearly  And he taught them a lot ”As important to Mr  Cook as his music was religion  Denominations and practices were like the rhythms he mi  and made seamless African spiritual disciplines and Christianity  Judaism and Islam  Buddhism and Rastafarianism were all part of his spiritual path “He was open to picking out the best elements of many religions  and I think it was in an effort to seek truth ” his aunt said  “He could be in a mosque one day and be in a Christian church the next day  He was very universal in his acceptance  and again  I think that stems from his early bout with cancer ”In addition to his parents  brother  sister  and aunt  Mr  Cook leaves another brother  Ashé of New York City Likening his brother to stars that “burn so bright they don’t last long ” Israel  nsaid in the church that “Paige Academy was Ahmed  and Ahmed was Paige Academy ”“People say gifted spirits only come to us for a short time ” Archung said earlier in an interview  “and if that’s true  Ahmed was an example of that ”', '2014_166')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article',

making                In 2006  as a freshman at Susquehanna University in central Pennsylvania  when many of his peers were clinging to dreams of basketball stardom  Burke was already deciding that he would  pursue that dream  He would be a writer  nIt was a somewhat surprising choice  Burke  who is around 6 feet tall  was a highly regarded  point guard and chose small  private Susquehanna because he lacked the grades and standardized test scores necessary for the half dozen Division I schools that had expressed interest   “I think that was probably the most difficult time of my life and the most enlightening too ” Burke says of the days he spent struggling with his decision  “I loved basketball  but it just didn’t feel right for me as a long term plan ’’   Indeed  Jean Burke  Marcus’s mom  says she recalls the night he called her in tears to tell her of his decision  “It was late  very late ” Jean Burke says  “First he told me he wanted to come home  and I knew something was wrong  Then he explained that basketball couldn’t be the end for him  that he wanted to do something different  I asked him what  and he said ‘write ’ That may have surprised me  but probably a year earlier  before he’d left for college  he showed me his writing  and I was blown away  I didn’t know he had it in him ”Jean Burke would later learn that Marcus and his older sister Xandria used to sit up late and write poetry and fiction together through much of their teen years  critiquing each other’s work  “A lot of times we wouldn’t even go to sleep ” said Xandria  a chef  who also lives in Iowa City now  “We were so into writing that we’d go all night till we saw the sun coming up  And mom would never know why we were dragging when she ‘woke us up’ for school ” nNancy Drourr  a former director of development for Brimmer and May  the Chestnut Hill private school that Burke attended his last two years in high school  remembers getting to know “two Marcus Burkes ”“There was the star basketball player Marcus  who cared little for his studies when he got here and was convinced he could cruise through life on the back of his athletic skills ” said Drourr  who became his academic adviser  “And there was the other  calculating Marcus  who was a terrific  thoughtful writer and even then was able to paint a picture of life in a way that you often only see in older people ”There was a period when Drourr was concerned about whether sports star Marcus might overwhelm and smother thoughtful Marcus  because shortly after coming to Brimmer and May  he led the basketball team to a state title and was named a regional league MVP “Who could have blamed him for thinking then that basketball was his way out ” Drourr said  “I’m grateful though that on his own several years later he recognized that his life  if shared the right way  would resonate with people ”  When he got to Susquehanna  Burke impressed coaches with his drive  “He came in here and was one of the best players we had inch for inch  pound for pound  He gave us everything he had ’’ said Frank Marcinek  the college’s head basketball coach and assistant athletic director  “He was just tremendous ’ In his junior year at Susquehanna  his basketball playing time was diminishing because of knee problems  but his confidence in his writing was growing    That he became a writer was not a shock to Marcinek  Burke “was maybe in his junior year  and he would sit behind me on the bus going to games ’’ the coach recalled  “And he was composing a story  which I think became his novel  And he would actually speak it out as he wrote  So while I haven’t had a chance to read the book yet I heard most of it and don’t expect to be surprised ’’  By his senior year  Burke had learned about the famed Iowa Writer’s Workshop at the University of Iowa and decided he would take a shot at it  He applied in his senior year  was accepted  and moved to Iowa City in 2010  eventually earning a master’s of fine arts degree and completing “Team Seven ”“Undergraduate school was a whirlwind ” Burke said  “And in a way  I had started to treat my writing like I had my basketball at one point — like I was invincible  So it was good for me to get to Iowa and have to learn from people who knew the craft better than me  It was humbling but good for me ”                Back in his old Milton neighborhood  Burke strolled slowly  pointing to different homes and saying things like “that’s where Reggie lived ” and “this is the corner I reference in the book about where Team Seven  the ‘real’ Team Seven hung out ”His manner of speech seems familiar because he adopts the same conversational tone in his book  Burke stopped in front of one two story olive green house  pointed upstairs  and said  “and that’s where Andre — me  really — lived  That was my bedroom  our bedroom right there ”The “real Team Seven ” Burke explained was more a collection of teen boys with more hopes than realistic ambitions  n“We’d hang here at the corner and talk about our other interests — playing basketball and girls ’’ he said  “We got into stuff  but certainly no battles with neighborhood drug dealers  That part of the book isn’t autobiographical  But it still paints a picture of how in urban areas you can be surrounded by that kind of thing even in a neighborhood that appears to be safe and dull till the sun goes down ”               One of Burke’s last stops before heading back to Iowa City  where he teaches an introduction to fiction writing class at the university  was South Middle School in Brockton  where his family had lived briefly during his childhood before moving to Milton Before a packed auditorium of more than 200 students  he read an excerpt from “Team Seven ” describing how Andre and his mother had gotten a call from his estranged  deadbeat father asking them to meet him outside Berklee College of Music so that he could give mother and son a bag of groceries While Burke read  the students silently leaned in or sucked in their breath or giggled quietly at the vivid details of Andre’s defiant conversation with his mother upon being stood up by the wayward father — one in which the mother eventually goes “upside his head” for disrespectimg her Later  as they filed out of the auditorium  student after student stopped Burke to tell him they related to Andre One group of boys hung back and waited for their classmates to get out of earshot before they sidled up and asked Burke about his secret for success  He grinned at the question  “You mean why did I decide to start taking my education seriously ” he asked  “Because with it  I can go a lot more places than I can on the court  And I decided that I just needed to stop worrying about what other people thought of me and what they thought I should do ”The crowd of boys grew until it spilled into a stairwell  And as Burke bade them farewell  one boy asked if they could “break” before they left — put their hands together like a sports team and shout a team slogan “Let’s do ‘South Middle School’ on three ” the boy suggested  His classmates frowned and shook their heads “Let’s do ‘work hard’ on three ” Burke countered  and most of the boys nodded and grinned  before joining hands and shouting in unison  “One  two  three  work hard ”Burke walked away smiling  “That’s what I’ve learned as I’ve learned to write ” he said  looking over his shoulder  “Way back when I started writing ‘Team Seven’ this was the audience I was writing to  These kids ”', '2014_945')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article',

aggressive to find the best players we can for our team ”There seems to be two separate factions in the current NBA  teams such as the Houston Rockets and Dallas Mavericks  who are scraping up as much

third pick after foot surgery  The Cleveland Cavaliers and Milwaukee Bucks couldn’t afford to miss in this draft  for different reasons  The Cavaliers couldn’t falter on their third top pick in the past four years  especially after the Bennett fiasco  The Bucks desperately need star power to generate momentum for a new arena  and   who is from nearby Chicago  displayed a willingness to play there “They really did have a lot of success  especially in the days with  ” said the 19 year old Parker  showing his knowledge of NBA history  “In the ’90s when they made the playoffs with   I just

commissionerhad announced  as the 15th pick in the NBA Draft   it was apparent something special was about to occur  Was Austin  a draft prospect until being diagnosed with Marfan syndrome  ending his playing career  going to sit there and witness the rest of the picks The NBA did one better  Silver announced that Austin had been drafted by the NBA  bringing him onto the stage to a standing ovation and presenting him with an NBA logo cap  It was a fitting tribute after a trying week for the 20 year old center from Baylor  who found out last week that he tested positive for Marfan Austin participated in the draft combine last month  and talked with the media about attempting to make the league despite being blind in one eye  During his medical examination  doctors told Austin that there was a possibility he had Marfan  a genetic disorder that can cause aortic enlargement  among other health issues  Austin tested positive “My parents originally found out the information the night before ” said Austin  when describing the day he learned the news  “As soon as they heard  they picked up their bags and my family drove nine hours from Kansas City to Dallas  where I was at “I remember that morning I woke up early  and went to  the gym  I remember I was driving home with my high school coach  coach      and we were doing the same thing we do all the time  laughing and joking around  As soon as we pulled up to my house  I just noticed a variety of cars and I noticed a couple of them that I recognized  I remember asking him what was up  and he couldn’t even look at me ”Austin said there was a gathering of people at his house  including the Baylor coaching staff and his pastor  He knew something was wrong “The first person’s face who I saw was my mother’s ” he said  “She was all the way in the back  I just remember seeing tears falling down her eyes  My dad’s arms around her  I knew then exactly what it was because I remember in Chicago they said I could have had this syndrome  I wanted to break down and cry  but I didn’t because my little brother and sister were in the room  I wanted to show them that I could be strong for them and for my family because they looked up to me ”As he spoke with the media  Austin became more reflective  He moved the audience with this statement  “God has truly blessed me because he could have continued to let me play basketball  But instead he saved my life ”Baylor has offered Austin a coaching position as he completes his degree  and the NBA has also offered him a yet to be determined position “These past couple of days have really taught me a lot about myself ” he said  “They’ve really shown me no matter what obstacle you’re thrown in life  there’s always a way around it  There’s no reason somebody should hang their head or not have the confidence in themselves in doing something ”Austin won’t ever play in the NBA  but on Thursday  he was a champion “It has been a dream come true ” he said  “I’ve met so many people that are supporting me and they don’t even know me on a personal level  Just being around all the draftees and seeing all my friends get drafted  it just brings joy in my heart because I know how hard we work to get to this point  I’ve been through it  Everything  the late nights in the gym  the early mornings in the gym  the injuries  the tears  the sweat  the blood  Everything ” n nOne of the interesting aspects of Roxbury native Napier heading to the Heat to perhaps join is his Hispanic background in a Latino dominated region “I was raised by my mom  and my mom’s full Puerto Rican  I kind of think I’m 75 percent ” Napier said  “I actually went out there my sophomore year and actually trained with the Puerto Rican team  It’s definitely something special  It’s super special definitely because my grandmother and my grandfather  they love it down there  in Puerto Rico   If I get a chance down there to go play for them  best bet I’m going to bring them with me “It’s just a special moment  and knowing that there’s a lot of Hispanics down in the Miami area  that’s going to bring a lot more people  it’s super special  man  My mind right now is twirling  I’m going to be honest with you  I’m just super happy right now ”Napier was considering leaving school following his junior season but made the astute move to remain for his final season  And that season eventually became legendary  as he led seventh seeded UConn to the national championship  Napier’s stock rose and he gained an admirer in James  who said repeatedly that Napier was his favorite player entering the draft The Heat swapped picks with the Hornets to get Napier at 24th overall  hoping that his presence will help retain James  who opted out of his contract last week  Napier’s meteoric rise from Charlestown High School to the NBA is a journey that he has cherished “Yeah  I didn’t do it on my own  I can tell you that much ” he said  “I got about a handful of guys that pushed me to get to where I am now  I’m just so happy that they were able to do that “I mean  it was tough  Just like any other neighborhood  there’s always people that are going to compete with you  But they allowed me to understand and see what I can be from when I was young  8 years old — a little kid running on the court during halftime shooting basketballs  to me right now in front of you guys who continue to push me  Like I said  it’s a special feeling ” nSurprisingly  given the depth of the draft  there were more underclassmen that declared than last year  and there were some definite losers who will now have to chase their NBA  dreams as undrafted free agents  Most notable were Louisville’s   Ohio State’s   UNLV’s  Missouri’s   New Mexico’s   North Carolina’s   Oregon State’s  UNLV’s  and  of St  John’s  Most of those players either weren’t ready for the NBA  Ross  Kirk  McAdoo  or entered the draft with red flags  Moreland  Behanan   but there will likely be a market for all of these players  Remember  Celtics reserve point guard signed a three year deal as an undrafted free agent         The 76ers attempted to work out prospects and  in the days before the draft but each turned down the invitation  The 76ers  who eventually took   were considering both with their third overall pick         The Nets are convinced  will return to the team for his 20th NBA season  which will be the final year of his contract and likely his final NBA season  There was speculation Garnett would retire after a difficult ending to his first season in Brooklyn  but he has already begun preparing for 2014 15  The Nets are likely to pursue re signing   who wants to play two or three more seasons         Former Orlando Magic point guard  “Penny” will be inducted into the National

governor  “We cannot possibly rest between now and Nov  4 ” Clinton told the crowd  “You don’t want to wake up the day after this election and say  ‘I wish I could have done more ’ u2009” t nMore than 1 500 stalwart Coakley supporters  some of whom had traveled from Worcester and Lynn  packed into the Imperial Ballroom at the Park Plaza hotel  where they heard Clinton encourage them to “knock on doors  Send those e mails  Make those phone calls  Talk to every voter you can find ” nClinton’s appearance was one of many she has made for Democrats around the country this election season  Her Friday schedule also included an appearance for US Representative Mike Michaud  the Democratic candidate for governor in Maine  Next weekend  she plans to appear at a rally for US Senator Jeanne Shaheen in New Hampshire  Clinton and Coakley were joined by Governor Deval Patrick  US Senators Elizabeth Warren and  Edward J  Markey  and Coakley’s running mate  Steve Kerrigan  Just before the rally began  Clinton held a fund raiser with Coakley at the Park Plaza that raised $500 000 Each speaker ticked off the issues — from early education to earned sick time to improving infrastructure to women’s reproductive rights — that they said distinguish Coakley from her Republican rival  Charlie Baker  “Republicans today care about the folks who are already comfortable ” Patrick said  “Democrats are about helping people find the path to get comfortable  That is the difference ”And while Friday’s rally was about helping Coakley beat Baker  who  according to the most recent Globe poll  leads her by 9 percentage points  there were moments when Clinton widened the aperture of the lens “This is one of those election years that will really set the stage for what comes here and in Massachusetts and around the country ” she said  Clinton praised Patrick  the Democratic ticket  and the state’s congressional delegation  She was effusive in her praise of Warren  whom she called a “passionate champion for working people and middle class families ”“I love watching Elizabeth giving it to those who deserve to get it ” she said  There has been much speculation about Warren making a run for the White House in 2016  which raises the prospect of squaring off against Clinton  who is widely seen as the front runner for the Democratic nomination  should she decide to run  Warren  though  has repeatedly dismissed the notion of a presidential bid in 2016  But Friday was about Coakley  and those standing with her seemed undeterred by Baker’s recent surge in public polls  The campaign said its internal polling shows the race within 2 points “We are in a dead heat ” Coakley told the raucous group of supporters  “And I promise you  we are going to win this race ”Coakley said she would be victorious because of the energy and enthusiasm of her supporters  while outlining what she saw as grave consequences if Baker is elected  “We will see budgets cuts  services cut  crucial jobs cut  or maybe even outsourced ” she said  “Charlie Baker has spent a lot of a lot of time in this race talking about his record creating jobs  He just forgot to tell you they’re in India ”When the nearly two hour rally was over  those present said they were fired up  “This is the first time I came to this type of event  and I am ready to knock on doors right now ” said Doris Cristobal  who lives in Lynn  Nov  4 will be the first time the Peruvian native will vote as an American citizen  “As a worker  I am cleaning offices  and she supports me ” said Cristobal  who was holding an oversized campaign sign  “Minimum wage  Earned sick time  She supports me ”Eileen Kenner of Dorchester said seeing so many powerful women on stage was long overdue  It’s time the state had its first elected female governor and female president  she said “Women have to collaborate  we have to unite ” said Kenner  who was wearing a head wrap and matching skirt adorned with American flags Coakley  she said  is the candidate to ensure economic development comes to urban communities  “Those who have selective amnesia can look at the record and see ” she said of those people considering Baker  Baker  a former health care executive  hasn’t leaned on high wattage Republicans for public events as Coakley has with Democrats  though he did enlist former presidential candidate Mitt Romney for a recent private fund raiser On the Democratic side  in addition to the state’s leading Democrats — Warren and Patrick are campaign trail regulars — top national figures have come out to support Coakley’s campaign Former president Bill Clinton rallied for her in Worcester  Michelle Obama sang her praises at the Strand Theatre in Dorchester  And Vice President Joe Biden will host a fund raiser for Coakley Wednesday at the Banshee  a Dorchester Irish pub Still  Baker and groups supporting him have been airing more broadcast television ads  spending more money on those ads  and  specialists say  reaching more viewers than Coakley and her allies — something that came up repeatedly during Friday’s rally  “They think they can buy this race ” Warren said  “Well  I want to be clear about one

allegedly groped a child twice  and another as a churchgoer  family man  and MBTA retiree who sought classroom work in his 80s to give back to young people  As Ramsay was released on $500 bail with an order to stay away from children and wear a monitoring device  his lawyer  James Dilday  called the charges devastating and surreal   t n“It’s as if an anvil fell on his head ” said Dilday  who has known Ramsay for decades through Roxbury’s St  Cyprian’s Episcopal Church  where Ramsay  a Korean War veteran  has been a fixture in the choir and the men’s fellowship Seeking higher bail  Assistant Suffolk District Attorney Gerry Cahill said another classroom aide at the Higginson Lewis K 8 school in Roxbury spotted Ramsay rubbing an 11 year old girl “back and forth  back and forth” between her thighs on Nov  13   The aide “repositioned himself to get a better look and was shocked at what he saw ” Cahill said  After the aide reported that allegation to the school  police interviewed him the next day and the girl the following week  The 11 year old told investigators that Ramsay touched “my privates” and also “rubbed my butt and was being fresh ” according to a detective’s report  The girl demonstrated the motion  and said Ramsay had touched her on two different days  Nov  10 and Nov  13  Police arrested and charged Ramsay Nov  21  the day after they spoke to the girl  A magistrate released him on $500 bail  to appear in court for Monday’s arraignment  Citing the aide’s as well as the girl’s account  the prosecutor asked Judge Kenneth Fiandaca to raise bail to $5 000 and order Ramsay to stay away from the child and her family  wear a GPS monitoring device  and keep at least 1 000 feet from any school  playground  park  library  toy store  or “other location with children congregating ”“The reason for this request and those conditions are the facts and strength of the case ” Cahill said  acknowledging that Ramsay had no previous record  Ramsay worked 32 years for the MBTA  rising from bus driver to inspector supervisor  Dilday said  Records show he retired in 1991  He worked off and on for the School Department as a lunchroom monitor and then a classroom aide from 2001 until Nov  14  when he resigned  a Boston Public Schools spokesman said  With Ramsay standing silently before the judge in a neat blue suit  fingers laced in front of him  his defense lawyer described him as an older man in fragile health — a survivor of open heart surgery  high blood pressure  and glaucoma surgery on both eyes — and a community pillar who poses no public danger or flight risk  In arguing against the higher bail  Dilday also pointed out Ramsay’s wife and two daughters  holding hands in the gallery  as well as three women from his church who had come to support him  The judge agreed to maintain bail at $500 and set the keep away order at 300 feet — in Ramsay’s Dorchester neighborhood  almost every block is within 1 000 feet of a school  playground  library  preschool  or park — but otherwise approved the prosecutor’s conditions  Ramsay  whose name was misspelled in some court documents and previous news accounts as “Ramsey ” avoided reporters after the arraignment by slipping out a side door with his family  The girl’s father  who sat quietly in the courtroom  declined to comment afterward but said earlier that he was upset Ramsay had not been arrested immediately when the aide who said he witnessed the alleged assault came forward  He said his daughter  who has autism  was traumatized and has been transferred from Higginson Lewis  the only school she had known  Ramsay is due back in court Jan  7 for a pretrial hearing  Dilday disputed the Commonwealth’s case  “I don’t believe he did it  and I’m not saying that because I’m his lawyer  I’m saying that because of what I know about the man ” he told reporters  “He’s not a pedophile  I repeat  he’s not a pedophile ”', '2014_459')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no

received a flood of tips from around the country Tuesday  as new details emerged about the turning point in the investigation of the notorious Gardner Museum heist 23 years ago The latest  exhaustive phase in the inquiry is based on a tip that a caller made to authorities in 2010  according to Anthony Amore  the Gardner Museum’s head of security and chief investigator  t nHe said Tuesday that the tip was so fruitful — leading to the announcement that investigators know the identities of the thieves and could trace the art from Boston to Connecticut and Philadelphia — that the FBI has since rededicated significant resources to investigating the heist “That tip  plus thousands of man hours  led to where we are today ” Amore said The US attorney’s office in Boston — which earlier this week joined the FBI in saying publicly for the first time that they know the identity of the thieves  although not the current location of the missing paintings — has assigned two prosecutors to the investigation  and they have communicated with investigators in   Connecticut and Philadelphia “We really have reached a point in the investigation where the whodunit part is over  and now  ‘Where’s the art ’ u2009” Damon Katz  chief counsel for Boston’s FBI division  said Tuesday  “That’s the only thing we’re   focused on in this point of this investigation  it’s finding the art with the public’s assistance ”Investigators hope that a public awareness campaign they announced Monday — 25 billboards with images of the stolen art went up Monday in Philadelphia — will lead to further tips  in what has been called the final chapter of the investigation  t n“I do believe there are people out there who can give us information that will get us to the paintings ” said Amore  who has worked closely with federal investigators He added  “Assistance from the public is essential ”The public awareness effort  which includes a $5 million   reward being offered by the museum for the return of the art in good condition  is similar to the campaign that ultimately led to the arrest in June 2011 of James “Whitey” Bulger after 16 years on the lam  With Bulger in custody  public officials have said that their focus has turned toward the Gardner heist  one of the greatest and most sophisticated art thefts in history “It’s been 23 years that those paintings have been missing from the museum  and we would like very much to put them back there ” said Katz Neither he nor Amore would discuss Tuesday the nature of the tips   received   nThe theft has captivated the public’s imagination in large part because of the boldness with which it was carried out  Two men dressed as Boston   police officers conned their way into the museum in the early morning hours of March 18  1990  telling the two guards on duty that they were responding to a disturbance They tied the guards up with duct tape  left them in a basement  and made their way through the museum  walking off with 13 artworks  including three Rembrandts  a Vermeer  and a Manet  The artworks were valued at $500 million  though they are essentially priceless in that they have   become so legendary Authorities would not disclose the identities of the people they believe were involved in the heist  saying it would hinder the investigation  but the declaration that some of the works made their way through organized crime circles in   Connecticut and Philadelphia has helped to confirm a line of inquiry that has emerged in   recent years The latest focus has been on Robert Gentile  a 75 year old ailing Mafia figure with ties to organized crime in Philadelphia and Boston  His Connecticut home was searched last year in relation to the heist  He was charged with drug dealing and possession of an illegal firearm in what his lawyer called a tactic by the FBI to pressure him to disclose information about the heist Gentile  who pleaded guilty and is slated to be sentenced in May  faces a lengthy prison term  His lawyer  Ryan McGuigan  has maintained that Gentile knows nothing about the heist or the whereabouts of the artwork But investigators seem to have trained their focus on Gentile in the recent phase of the investigation A person with knowledge of the FBI investigation  who asked to remain anonymous   because of the sensitivity of the inquiry  confirmed Tuesday that investigators found a list of the art stolen from the Gardner  and the estimated value of the works  during the search of Gentile’s home  The discovery of the list was first   reported by The Hartford   Courant Gentile also had close ties to organized crime figures in Philadelphia and in Boston  including the late Robert Guarente  who has been tied to almost every  one mentioned as a person of interest in the heist Guarente  for instance  was close with the late Carmello Merlino  who ran an auto body shop in Dorchester and who  according to FBI reports  once tried to negotiate the return of the artworks  No deal ever came to fruition  and Merlino was later convicted in a scheme to rob an armored car depot in Easton  He said that he was set up by informants and that the FBI was pressuring him for   information regarding the Gardner heist  Merlino died in prison in 2005 at age 71 Two other men were also convicted in the armored car depot scheme and received lengthy prison sentences  though they have denied knowledge of the heist or the   location of the artwork    Stephen Rossetti  54  who is Guarente’s nephew  is slated to be released in 2044  and David Turner  45  is set to be released in 2025 Guarente died in 2004 at age 65  His wife has told authorities in recent years that she saw him give Gentile at least one painting some time around 2003  around the time authorities say some of the art was offered for sale in Philadelphia  The wife  however  did not describe the painting as one of the works taken from the Gardner', '2014_1018')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article',

the process of transforming it into a peaceful garden oasis meant to honor Steven Odom  a 13 year old boy fatally shot nearby in 2007  nAt an ceremony officially naming the land the Steven P  Odom Tranquility Garden  officials and activists outlined their vision of a park that would serve as a sanctuary for Dorchester youths seeking a place to reflect and recharge  t n“We have worked to turn our pain into something positive ” said Odom’s mother  Kim Odom  who prompted tears in the crowd when she read aloud from a dog eared journal in which her son  had denounced violence in Dorchester  “Our desire is to build something where young people will be able to come and have a quiet space to reflect and deal with that part of them that needs healing  in a healthy way ”Odom’s death is well remembered in Dorchester  in part because of its shocking senselessness   In October 2007  police said  a shooter fired wildly at Odom and several friends as they walked home from a game of pickup basketball after mistaking one for a rival gang member  Odom    a husky  cheerful middle schooler who had played the drums with gleeful abandon  who had worn the rubber on his basketball smooth  who could defuse his mom’s scolding with a cheeky joke  and who had nothing to do with gangs    was struck once in the head  He died just feet from the safety of his home Odom’s parents have gone public with their story  They have become deeply involved in anti violence advocacy  and visited the White House in February 2013  where Kim Odom read from her son’s journal to Michelle Obama But the garden is the first permanent memorial to Odom  His family hopes it will become a fixture in the neighborhood  one that carries Odom’s forward to future generations “This garden here is really going to keep Steven’s memory alive ” said Boston Mayor Martin J  Walsh  who helped dedicate the park and gave Kim Odom rosary beads that had been blessed by Pope Francis  “The focus is going to be on young people coming and reflecting about life ” t nSteven’s father  Ronald Odom  a mail carrier and preacher at the True Vine Church  said that even after more than six years  grief over his son’s killing still intrudes without warning “It’s a constant struggle ” he said  choking back tears  “The preacher in me is preaching to the father in me  because the father will never understand ”Ronald Odom fondly recalled mornings when Steven would miss the bus  an annoyance that forced him to drive his son to school  but also gave the two time to talk and bond  “Don’t get in trouble and make me have to come pick you up from school ” he would tell his son  The boy never got in trouble  Walsh praised the Odoms for their tireless advocacy  and said their words add urgency as his administration’s plans to combat persistent violence “It gives me inspiration ” he said  “Here’s a mother who lost a son  and she’s taken that unfortunate experience and turned it into a positive ” Kim Odom acknowledged Walsh’s praise  but said turning her son’s death into positive action has not always been easy “I can remember many times sitting on my couch alone  praying and asking God for help  wanting to raise my voice  but feeling like maybe I didn’t really have the energy  or maybe I was the only one feeling how I was feeling ” she said But Kim Odom has found solace in her faith and in the community of other survivors of violence  With the help of both  she hopes to make her vision of the garden a reality “In five years  I want to drive by and see the full diversity of our community in there

people showed him in Boston clubs  nHernandez “had become increasingly sensitive and angered by what he believed to be people testing  trying  or otherwise disrespecting him ” said Patrick Haggan  first assistant Suffolk district attorney That night at Cure Lounge  Hernandez had had enough  said police  While the former Patriots star stood near the dance floor  Daniel Abreu  dancing nearby  bumped into him  causing him to spill some of his drink  Abreu  who had never met Hernandez  smiled and kept dancing  Hernandez was livid  said Haggan  At 2 30 a m  July 16  Hernandez followed the BMW Abreu was driving and fired five shots into the sedan  killing Abreu and his friend Safiro Furtado  Haggan said On Wednesday  Hernandez  25  was arraigned on seven charges  including two counts of first degree murder in the shootings of Abreu  29  and Furtado  28  two Cape Verdean immigrants living in Dorchester who worked for the same cleaning company Hernandez  dressed in a navy blue jacket and khaki pants  said not guilty in a clear voice to each of the counts  He was ordered held without bail  nAt least a dozen of the victims’s relatives sat in the courtroom  sobbing during much of the proceeding “Asesino ” Portuguese for killer  one woman said loudly when Hernandez walked in The relatives packed the first two rows  but Hernandez looked past them toward his fiancee  Shayanna Jenkins  who sat directly behind the families  her face expressionless  nHaggan gave a detailed version of the police investigation in court  describing Hernandez as a man so consumed by the way he perceived strangers were treating him that he essentially stalked Abreu and his friends as they left the club Haggan  who said police had scoured surveillance video and talked to witnesses  gave this account of what authorities say transpired that July night and the next morning At 10 p m   Hernandez and a friend left Manchester  Conn   to go clubbing in Boston Hernandez brought his gun  a  38 caliber revolver that he stashed in an engine compartment of a silver 2006 Toyota Forerunner sport utility vehicle that a Rhode Island car dealer had loaned to him as part of a promotional agreement Hernadez and his friend  whom Haggan did not identify  parked at a garage on Tremont Street  Less than five minutes later  Abreu  who was driving his sister’s 2003 BMW  pulled into the same garage with Furtado and three other friends At about 12 30 a m   the group was waiting in a line to show their IDs and pay a cover charge as Hernandez and his friend breezed past them  Minutes later  as Hernandez held his drink  Abreu brushed by him Hernandez told his friend that Abreu deliberately bumped into him and did not bother to apologize  “He is trying me ” Hernandez allegedly said As Hernandez became angrier  his friend persuaded him to leave the club  Outside  the friend tried to calm down Hernandez  They went to another club across the street Fifteen minutes  Hernandez pointed out a small group of men who had come in and said that Abreu was among them  He told his friend they were following him Video surveillance later showed that Abreu and his friends were still at Cure at this time Hernandez and his friend went back to the SUV and began driving around the Theatre District  They pulled over  and Hernandez opened the hood to get his gun At about 2 10 a m   Abreu  Furtado  and his friends left Cure  Haggan said in court As they walked down Tremont Street toward the garage  Hernandez’s SUV drove slowly past them  The SUV looped around the block  then stopped  Hernandez and his friend got out of the car and watched as the BMW came out of the garage and picked up two of the men in the group who had waited for the car outside As the BMW pulled away  Hernandez and his friend got back into the SUV and began following them  running through a red light to catch up  nAbreu  Furtado  and his friends  unaware they were being followed  stopped at a light on Shawmut Avenue and Herald Street Hernandez pulled up next to them  rolled down the window  and said  “Yo  what’s up now ”Hernandez used a racial slur  then allegedly fired  He kept pulling the trigger even after the gun was emptied  Haggan said As they drove back to Connecticut  Hernandez allegedly told his friend  “I think I got one in the head and the other in the chest ”Search warrant affidavits filed in Connecticut have identified Hernandez’s friend that night as Alexander Bradley  who is suing Hernandez for allegedly shooting him in the face in 2013 after they hung out at a Florida nightclub After the arraignment  Suffolk District Attorney Daniel F  Conley described Bradley as a witness  He has not been charged in connection with the 2012 killings  Conley’s spokesman declined to comment on whether Bradley or anyone else is being spared prosecution in exchange for their testimony  nAfter Haggan spoke  Hernandez’s lawyer  Charles W  Rankin  objected to the “one sided” recitation  stating the court had allowed the prosecutor to “make a speech ”“The Commonwealth’s summary serves no other purpose than to poison the jury pool ” Rankin said Trial Magistrate Gary D  Wilson responded forcefully  saying there was nothing unusual about Haggan’s statements  “I’ve conducted over 1 900 arraignments in capital cases in Suffolk County since 1983  and on each occasion a prosecutor has been afforded an opportunity to speak ” Wilson said Hernandez is also facing charges in Bristol Superior Court in the 2013 fatal shooting of Odin L  Lloyd of Boston  He has pleaded not guilty',

be unveiled Monday in Springfield The effort  authorized by recently passed legislation  creates a uniform system that classifies the severity of leaks and sets a timeline for their repair based on the risks  It also allows utilities to more quickly recover the costs of repairs from customers in the form of higher rates  t nThose repairs could add an estimated $1 to $2 a month to the average gas bill  industry officials say  But over the longer term  Massachusetts customers could save tens of millions of dollars a year once all gas leaks are repaired  That’s because they will no longer have to pay for gas lost to those leaks  nLocal utilities respond to tens of thousands of calls about potential gas leaks each year and reported more than 25 000 leaks to regulators at the end of September “As this flammable gas travels under our feet in often archaic pipes  I’m thrilled we are compelling gas companies to track their known leaks in a more transparent and uniform way ” said state Representative Lori Ehrlich  a Democrat from Marblehead who has long pushed to repair gas leaks  “The stakes are too high ”Natural gas explosions  including  that injured 11 people in Dorchester  have called attention to the problem  but the issue has gathered momentum as researchers have quantified the amount of gas lost from thousands of  in aging pipelines  and  — to customers and   A  commissioned by Senator Edward J  Markey  a Malden Democrat  shows that in Massachusetts alone  natural gas consumers paid up to $1 5 billion from 2000 to 2011 for gas that never made it to them because of leaks  In addition  natural gas used to heat homes is mostly methane  a potent greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change  n t nSeveral legislators filed gas leak bills this session  Industry and environmentalists worked with local political leaders to craft a compromise version passed by the Legislature and approved by Patrick on June 26  The law also requires utilities to fix all but the least hazardous of leaks whenever road construction projects expose a pipeline and to give priority to leaks within 50 feet of a school Earlier versions of the bill went further  requiring  for instance  that all leaks be repaired during road construction and giving priority to places of public assembly  such as churches and hospitals  not just schools Despite the changes  lawmakers said it achieves most of their goals  State Representative John D  Keenan  a Salem Democrat who also filed a gas leaks repair bill  called the new law a “great success ”Utilities said the law not only allows them to repair leaks faster and recover costs in a timely manner but also has provisions that will allow them to bring natural gas service to more Massachusetts residents  Natural gas in recent years has been significantly cheaper than heating oil “This will allow us to accelerate the replacement of aging infrastructure ” said Thomas M  Kiley  chief executive of the Northeast Gas Association  a Needham based industry group that represents gas utilities  “The bottom line is that there are going to be less leaks going forward ”On Monday  Patrick will join state officials for an event publicizing the law in Springfield  where a natural gas explosion leveled a club in 2012 and injured more than a dozen  The State Fire Marshal said a worker from Columbia Gas of Massachusetts accidentally punctured a high pressure gas line at the foundation of the building while investigating a gas odor Markey is pushing two bills at the federal level  One  similar to the Massachusetts law  aims to revamp pipeline development and repair policies to address the biggest leaks first while making it easier for utilities to recover their costs  The other would create a program to help finance such projects with federal money and matching funds from states Markey said the new state law is a precursor to his national plan  “Massachusetts is yet again leading the way for the nation on energy and climate change ” he said  n•  n•  n•  n•  n', '2014_169')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article',

losers in the initial round of recommendations made in March by a seven member selection committee to the Boston Redevelopment Authority Starbucks  Burger King  Dunkin’ Donuts  and Subway didn’t make the cut to lease space on the ground floor of the future headquarters of the Boston School Department  Local favorites  including the venerated Haley House cafe  nonprofit Discover Roxbury  and restaurateur Darryl Settles also came up short  Instead  the selection committee  comprised mostly of city officials  chose the following six proposals from among 22 submissions  Tasty Burger  Clover Fast Food  Final Touch With Class apparel shop  Gallery Eye Care  Wilcox Hospitality Group Parish Cafe  and ShantiBoston prepared foods  The list  however  remains somewhat fluid  nIt’s great that so many private companies want a presence in the city owned Ferdinand Building  once home to the region’s largest furniture business  The building has been empty for more than 30 years while political leaders engaged in idle chatter about resurrecting Dudley Square and the surrounding low income neighborhood  Three years ago  former Mayor Thomas Menino announced and implemented a plan to move 500 School Department employees from their downtown headquarters to Dudley Square by 2015  Newly elected Mayor Martin Walsh has jumped aboard  And just as Menino and Walsh had hoped  private developers are now expressing interest in other city owned parcels — including a portion of the 2100 block of Washington Street — in this formerly desolate section of Roxbury With so much new construction underway  the neighborhood looks like it is on the verge of turning the corner economically  It’s still somewhat sketchy  But walking around has a similar feel to the South End during the late 1970s  when that neighborhood began its transition from a run down part of town to a desirable address  There are real concerns  however  For every Roxbury resident who longs to see the construction of upmarket shops and market rate housing in Dudley Square  there are probably two who worry that low income families will be pushed out by gentrification Architects and construction engineers associated with Shawmut Design and Construction figured out how to restore the Ferdinand Building on an irregular  triangular block  City planners  at least  should be able to find the right mix of tenants for 18 000 square feet of commercial space  They should see it as a microcosm of Boston’s challenge to create safe and attractive neighborhoods without driving out families of modest means Finding space for Haley House would be a good start  The nonprofit group that started out in 1966 as a soup kitchen in the South End has not only stayed true to its original social vision but expanded into Dudley Square with a terrific bakery and cafe  The food  conversation  and hospitality are consistently good  People who are down on their luck feel as much at home in the cafe as the neighborhood’s movers and shakers  It would make so much sense for the group to extend its reach by bringing organic pizza and homemade ice cream into a commercial space at the Ferdinand Building  Hundreds have signed a petition in favor of Haley House’s application  And by midweek  it appeared that the selection committee might actually reconsider a bad decision A loyal streak runs through residents of Roxbury  There are not many places in the city where a Foot Locker can set up shop next door to a mom and pop sneaker store and it’s the Foot Locker that goes out of business  But it happened a few years ago in Dudley Square  n“There are organizations and businesses that have been here and represent what the future could and should look like ’’ said Roxbury activist Kim Janey  who co chairs Discover Roxbury  The homegrown arts organization was also unsuccessful in its bid for space in the Ferdinand Building Ferdinand’s planners want to see the lunch places on the ground floor turn into dinner places with table service in the evening  State lawmakers could help by lifting the cap on liquor licenses  which are few and far between in Roxbury  But why stop there  After dinner  restaurant space at the Ferdinand could be transformed into a nightclub and lounge  Such entertainment venues are also rare in Roxbury  The concept works well at Dbar on Dorchester Avenue  another comeback neighborhood Prosperous neighborhoods don’t need to be posh  But they need the right mix  The Ferdinand block in Roxbury is now in position to show how it’s done  n•  n•  n', '2014_902')","('no

Rev  Bruce Wall  one of Boston’s most prominent black community leaders  said Thursday that he has stepped down as head of a Dorchester advocacy group that sent a $105 000 invoice to the state’s new commuter rail company for services that were never under contract Wall said in an interview Thursday and in a television appearance Wednesday night that he wanted to distance himself from other people in DRM Advisory Group who made decisions that had affected him in his role as chairman  n“What has happened is that people have made decisions that have tarnished my integrity  and now I am in a fight for my life to defend who I am and what I represent ” he said Wall made the television appearance on Boston Neighborhood Network on the same day that he  the advisory group — also known as Dorchester  Roxbury  Mattapan Advisory Group — and the Rev  Eugene F  Rivers III were the subject of a Globe column The column depicted a meeting that Rivers  another prominent community leader  had with a representative from Keolis North America in which Rivers handed the representative a $105 000 invoice for services that were never discussed  an episode that the Keolis official described as a “shakedown ” The invoice  which was also e mailed  was signed by Wall Rivers  who allegedly told the Keolis representative that he was working “below the radar ” and that he was “secret ops ” denied doing anything wrong and said the invoice was meant to push Keolis to keep its commitment to diversity in running the state’s commuter rail system  He said he never expected any money  Rivers did not return a call for comment Thursday Wall has repeatedly said since the column was published that he joined the group to help assure minority communities of greater involvement in the state contract  but that he was being held responsible for the decisions of others  n“I’m not a businessman  I’m a pastor ” Wall said  “Frankly  I’m in over my head on this stuff ”Wall did not identify Rivers as the person from whom he was trying to distance himself  but said  “I think Rev  Rivers is Rev  Rivers  I think he’s consistent in advocating for the community the way he does  I don’t think you could have expected anything different out of him ”The depiction of the alleged “shakedown” of the Keolis representative caused a stir throughout Greater Boston  from the city’s black community to legal circles and the State House Governor Deval Patrick said on his regular radio appearance on WGBH on Thursday that he supported the concept of pushing for diversity in the Keolis contract and that the entire DRM group should not be judged by the actions of one member  He did not identify anyone by name “Do I think the whole program is tainted because one guy allegedly tried to control it  No  I don’t ” he said  “I don’t think there’s any evidence of that  either ”Wall said he was trying to distance himself from the depiction of a “shakedown ” saying he was only trying to “shake up” Keolis’s stated commitment to working with the black community Legal analysts  speaking on the allegations in general and not about any individual  said charges of attempted extortion could be brought against any individual who makes a threat  not only of physical harm  but also economic harm “Demanding cash with threats of economic harm could easily be viewed by law enforcement as an attempted extortion ” said Brian Kelly  former head of the public corruption unit in the US attorney’s office in Boston  who now works as a defense lawyer Brad Bailey  also a former state and federal prosecutor who now works in criminal defense  said many other factors could be at play  such as whether a contract was discussed But he added  “As we know the facts  one certainly on the surface could look at it as a possible or attempted shakedown  You don’t have to have a threat of violence  a threat of criminal acts  You just have to have a threat that would make people do things or give up property that they wouldn’t normally give up ” he said Officials with the US attorney’s office in Boston  the state attorney general’s office  and the Suffolk district attorney would not comment on the allegations and would not say if they would investigate  citing their policy not to comment on investigations Aware that the Globe column was about to be published  Wall and other black community leaders from DRM went on the offensive Tuesday evening  trying to justify the invoice they sent to Keolis  which recently won a $2 68 billion contract to run the state’s commuter rail system  They discussed the invoice and the pending column on a radio show Keolis’s parent company  based in France  has been accused of discrimination against African and Muslim employees and has been criticized for its collaboration with Nazi leaders 70 years ago  The company is also under deadline pressure to meet a requirement of its Massachusetts contract that 15 percent of its vendors represent minority groups  The contract goes into effect July 1 On Tuesday night  before the column was published  Wall told listeners of his show on Boston Praise radio to expect the piece and sought to explain the invoice  saying it was to push the company to engage the black community He said he was encouraged when Keolis officials told him that they were thankful for DRM Advisory Group’s support and that they wanted to continue working with the group  But he said he became concerned when he stopped hearing from them Wall said that DRM had previously presented a community action plan to Keolis and that the invoice was to put pressure on the company to keep its commitments  Keolis denies making the commitments reflected in the invoice “Everything was going relatively smooth  until we made the noise ” Wall said Tuesday  adding  “The invoice was to rattle the cage  to make them come back to the table ”Other guests on Wall’s show seemed to be as direct  Leonard Lee  a community activist who said he does public health consulting work  said that the group researched the state’s existing commuter rail contract and that he was concerned that not enough jobs are currently going to minority communities “We knew the devil we were dealing with  and he wasn’t giving us a dime ” he said The Rev  Mark Scott  of DRM  said the idea for the invoice came after a lawyer in the group noted that Keolis had paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to a lobbyist “There were people in the room who were making money  there were people in the room who were getting paid ” Scott  associate pastor at Azusa Christian Community in Dorchester  said on the radio show  “It wasn’t us ”A community meeting is scheduled for April 22 at Wall’s Global Ministries Christian Church in Dorchester  A notice of the meeting — asking  “Give War a Chance ” — was sent to Keolis’s website Monday  signed by Shabazz Muhammad  an apparently fictitious name The message  accusing Keolis of racism and vowing to exact a “high price for discrimination against black people ” included an e mail address that is owned by Lee  He denied sending the message and raised concerns that his e mail was hacked  But he said he supported the

That was the takeaway message Friday night as beloved Boston vocal group New Edition returned to the members’ hometown for the first time in years to spread a little soul pop love at the Agganis Arena  t nThis outing has been dubbed the “ AllSix” tour to celebrate the fact that every member of the still suave sextet was participating  And whenever Ricky Bell  Michael Bivins  Bobby Brown  Ronnie DeVoe  Johnny Gill — who originally joined as a replacement for Brown — and Ralph Tresvant were onstage together during the 90 minute set it was a joyous eruption of sweet harmony and synchronized hoofing  New Edition  who marked their 30th anniversary in 2013  took the excited crowd of 4 200 fans through their musical evolution from giddy kiddie bubblegum soul ditties to funky urban jams to smooth adult R B ballads But that journey was taken in fits in starts when  after a triumphant entrance by the entire group  the show was quickly divided into fractions of a 1 6  a 1 2  2 3  and 5 6

no begrudging Gill  Brown  and Tresvant their solo turns in the spotlight as each have had success going it alone and acquitted themselves well   Gill may have gone a bit over the top with the hooting and hollering on his exclamatory “My  My  My” but his enthusiasm was admirable  Tresvant showed off his still often silky vocals as much as his abs during his bit which included “Sensitivity ” A hoarse Brown sounded like he either blew his voice out during the tour’s first show the previous night or has simply damaged it over the years  but seemed to enjoy being onstage  until his vanishing act  Although his rougher vocals worked well on the group numbers he participated in like the pleading “Mr  Telephone” man  his solo set left more to be desired vocally and he curiously skipped big hits like “My Prerogative” and “Don’t Be Cruel ”  t nThe crowd was particularly excited when Bell Biv DeVoe did their new jack swing thing on tunes like “Do Me ”and “B B D   I Thought It Was Me  ” as an equally stoked band provided the bass heavy musical accompaniment  But it was telling that the night’s most thrilling moments came when the group played together  or mostly together  The trio of BBD and Tresvant sassily stepped and sang through classics like “Cool It Now” and “Count Me Out” still as light on their feet as ever as video images of their tween selves appeared onscreen above them  The peak came near the end with Gill rejoining for the sleek ballad “Can You Stand the Rain ”  BBD and Tresvant boosting Gill’s solo hit “Rub You the Right Way” to a higher level and Gill and Tresvant ecstatically pumping up BBD’s “Poison ” before all five guys crushed the sounds and steps of “If It Isn’t Love” in an exhilarating closer  Beyond a shout out to their home turf in Roxbury  the men didn’t do much in the way of bantering with the audience  but Tresvant did address the crowd near the show’s end  saying how thrilled they were to be back  promising that new music is in the

over the moon when she learned that a $150 000 budget appropriation for the Louis D  Brown Peace Institute in Fields Corner had survived the budget process   n t n“Oh  my goodness ” she said Tuesday  “I’m so excited  It speaks volumes “That amount is small change in the context of a $36 5 billion state budget  But it represents a lifeline for a community group that constantly struggles to keep going Working on the front lines with families wracked by violence doesn’t leave much time for lobbying or monitoring the budget process “There’s been 24 homicides now  and right now we’re dealing with another one ” Chery said “It’s hard to understand the complexities of the  budget  process and keep up with our priorities at the same time ”Chery’s path to activism is both tragic and well known  She has devoted herself to keeping the memory of her son alive  Louis  15  was gunned down outside the Fields Corner MBTA station in 1993  He wasn’t a target  but in an instant he was gone  t nChery quickly discovered there was very little support for families struggling to cope with homicide  There were police officers and prosecutors  but no one to help you deal with burying your child or coping with the aftermath So  in 1994  she founded the Louis D  Brown Peace Institute  Its primary role is to counsel survivors of violence  Volunteers help arrange funerals  a daunting issue for many families  Chery and the people who work with her will hold your hand for as long as you need them to  They encourage survivors to remember the lives of their loved ones  instead of their deaths This is how she describes its mission  “helping families transform their pain and anger into power and action ”They have always done this on a shoestring  An annual Mother’s Day “Walk for Peace” is its only significant fund raiser  Chery spends a lot of time looking for financial help As anyone who has visited her headquarters can attest  she is great at recruiting help “We look at human capital as a resource we can tap into ” Chery said  “It has been challenging  yet we have a lot of people who want to volunteer in helping us with marketing  grant writing  whatever skill sets people have that we can tap into ”Now that the state has given  Chery is eyeing the city budget process  She’s never dealt with the Walsh administration and isn’t sure what to expect  That’s not a criticism  just the reality of dealing with a new regime  one that is sorting out its priorities  She’s in a long line of people waiting to find out where they stand “We’re starting over ” she said Lawmakers deserve credit for funneling money to the institute and other deserving community programs  As always  not everyone is convinced that all of the money in the budget really exists  we’ll see  for example  how much of the millions expected from casino licenses ever materializes  nAt any rate  the concerns of Beacon Hill budget obsessives are different from those of a Dorchester activist whose deeply personal mission is now guaranteed to survive for another year “Nonprofits in urban settings are very  very difficult ” Chery said  “For us  the support and the belief of the community keeps us going and not giving up on what we believe in ”That kind of human capital may  in the end  be every bit as valuable as the money from Beacon Hill', '2014_871')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article',

district councilor Tito Jackson took the floor and began to speak  His voice shook a little  and he took a short break to compose himself as he stood before advocates  councilors  and public safety officials When he recovered  he began a story that hushed the room  of the day he found out that he was born to a 13 year old girl who had been sexually assaulted by two men  nIt was the first time that most people in the audience had heard Jackson share his story  Speaking during a discussion on assaults on women  he wanted to make a point “In this city and in cities across the country  when women are assaulted  we give them whistles ” Jackson said  speaking to the men in the audience  “But  you know what  brothers  What we need to do is to step up and be the solution  This is not a women’s problem  In fact  if you look at the statistics it is a men’s problem ” nJackson’s startling revelation came at the start of Wednesday’s council meeting on “White Ribbon Day ” an international campaign that targets men and urges them to pledge to keep women safe  The campaign began in 1991 in Canada on the second anniversary of one man’s massacre of 14 women in Montreal and spread to 60 countries  the Massachusetts White Ribbon Day Campaign said on its website Jane Doe Inc  launched this state’s effort in 2008  focusing on “positive masculinity” and encouraging boys and men to speak out against violence  the website said Councilor at Large Ayanna Pressley brought the effort to City Hall in 2010  A year later  she stood before a public meeting and declared she was raped as a college student  Pressley  who had previously said she was a survivor of abuse as a child and adult  made the statement as she discussed an upcoming hearing on sexual assaults on local college campuses Jackson’s story is a powerful testament  she said Wednesday “I think it’s very brave when people share their story ’’ said Pressley  “I know personally the impact that can have  You can tell his story impacted and captivated everyone  He had everyone’s full attention ”Jackson  who was adopted at 2 months old  said he first told of the violence against his birth mother during the hearing that Pressley called after she shared her own abuse “I think it makes me stronger every single time I say it ’’ Jackson said after Wednesday’s council meeting  “It means that this is a fight to redefine what manhood is to me  But it’s a fight that every man should take ”Jackson said he began inquiring about his birth mother while he was a student at the University of New Hampshire  At the time  he had gone to the doctor  and the doctor wanted to know about his family’s medical history  Jackson decided to contact the adoption agency that worked on his case to see what officials knew about his family’s medical records   n“I got a letter  from the agency  that I was born to a 13 year old mother who was sexually assaulted by two men ’’ Jackson recounted At the end of the speech  the audience stood and clapped  Mayor Martin J  Walsh entered the council chamber and hugged Jackson tightly “As men  we have a responsibility to stand up for our women in our community  and we have a duty to teach boys that being a man it is our duty to treat women with respect ” Walsh said He then led the men in the audience to take an antiviolence pledge “I will speak out against attitudes and behaviors that contribute to sexual assault and domestic violence ’’ they all said  “I will remind myself and others that gender violence is a men’s issue that affects us all ”Later  Jackson said it gets easier to talk about his history “For us guys  all of these secrets  this vulnerability  this pain  this toughness — all of those boxes we put around ourselves only damage us internally and cause loneliness and suffering and  often  depression ’’ he said  “Everybody has something that is going on with them ”', '2014_513')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article',

counts of first degree murder for allegedly firing a volley of shots from his car into another car    Suffolk District Attorney Daniel F  Conley said today Hernandez is accused of murdering Daniel Abreu and Safiro Furtado  The two men were shot to death while stopped at a traffic light on July 16  2012  by someone who drove up alongside them in an SUV with Rhode Island plates and opened fire  nThe new charges raise the disturbing possibility that Hernandez played NFL games during the 2012 2013 season after murdering two men  Hernandez now faces charges in three murders  He was already facing a first degree murder charge in the June 2013 slaying of Odin L  Lloyd of Boston in North Attleborough  Conley had no comment on whether there was a connection between the double slaying in Boston and the slaying in North Atleborough Conley said that after a “chance encounter” between Hernandez  Abreu  and Furtado at a Boston nightclub  Hernandez trailed the men in his car  Hernandez then allegedly pulled his car up to theirs  firing a  38 caliber Smith   Wesson pistol “multiple times” into the car  killing Abreu and Furtado  and injuring a third man Conley said investigators had been able to recover the murder weapon and the car Hernandez was driving  “For us  this case was not about Aaron Hernandez  This case was about two victims  who were stalked  ambushed  and senselessly murdered on the streets of the city they called home ” said Conley  n“This was a chance encounter where two young men were out     and basically had an encounter that led to their deaths ” said Police Commissioner William Evans  “I remember going to the scene that morning      It was a terrible tragedy ”Conley said no more information would be available about the “texture and detail” of the encounter at the nightclub until an arraignment next week  Conley said media reports had originally suggested that Abreu and Furtado were tied to a Cape Verdean gang based in Dorchester  He said the characterization was “unfair to their families and to their memories ”“Neither of them were involved in gangs  guns  or violent crime of any kind ” he said At the Furtado family home in Dorchester this afternoon Susan Vincente  a cousin  said the news of Hernandez’s indictment had generated powerful emotions “This is a very hard time for all of us ’’ she said  “Right now  I can’t even talk ’’No one was immediately available at the Abreu family home nearby Relatives of Abreu and Furtado have filed wrongful death lawsuits in Suffolk Superior Court  Each family is demanding that Hernandez pay them $6 million in damages  William T  Kennedy  who represents the Abreu and Furtado families  said today that the families are overwhelmed by the news  but also determined to let the Boston community know that the people they lost to gun violence were good men wrongly cut down too early in their life “The family would want people to know that Danny and Safiro were just two very good guys who were just trying to make their way in this world ’’ said Kennedy  “These are just a couple of hard working guys who had dreams like any other  They worked together cleaning toilets at the Quincy YMCA ’’On July 16  2012  Kennedy said  “They went out with a couple of other fellas and went to the club  danced with a couple of pretty girls  had a couple of drinks and  were heading  home ’’He added  “And somehow  they were made the object of somebody’s sick pursuits  There is no good reason at all” for their killings The grand jury has also indicted Hernandez’s cousin  Tanya Singleton  on a criminal contempt charge for refusing to testify to the grand jury about the SUV after being granted immunity  Conley said today The previously unsolved murders of Abreu and Furtado  two childhood friends from Cape Verde  had reached an investigative dead end until Boston police were urged to focus on Hernandez following the murder of Lloyd  Lloyd’s body was found June 17  2013  in an industrial park in North Attleborough  not far from Hernandez’s spacious home Hernandez has pleaded not guilty to all charges in Lloyd’s murder and is being held without bail in the Bristol County jail The Globe has reported  citing law enforcement sources and court records in two states  that   Hernandez had allegedly become concerned that Lloyd had told someone about Hernandez’s role in the slayings of Abreu and Furtado  prompting him to allegedly orchestrate Lloyd’s killing with two friends  who now also face murder charges  nMichael Fee and James Sultan  Hernandez’s attorneys in the Lloyd murder case  couldn’t immediately be reached for comment The double murder happened a week before the Patriots opened training camp for the 2012 2013 season  During that season  Hernandez played in 10 games  catching 51 passes for 483 yards and five touchdowns Lloyd’s relatives have also filed a wrongful death suit against Hernandez in Bristol County  where Lloyd was killed Separately  Ernest Wallace  one of Hernandez’s friends  is to be arraigned this afternoon in Bristol Superior Court in Fall River on a charge of first degree murder for allegedly participating in the killing of Lloyd Hernandez’s

relations ” he said in an interview  “That’s historic  that’s epic         that he would try to lead on that ” Walsh said Saturday that he hears residents’ concerns about racial justice  “We’re

Supported Agriculture got its national start in Massachusetts in 1984  at the Indian Line Farm in South Egremont  Since 2008  the number of CSAs in the state has tripled  to 150  We now rank third in the country in the number of farmers’ markets overall  after California and New York  Local organic farms not only bring healthy  clean food to our tables  They protect arable land  sustain wildlife populations  and stanch McMansion sprawl  Bakers  butchers  equipment suppliers  and small scale food companies of all stripes have sprung up alongside the kale  And these in turn are greatly enhancing the quality of life in communities from Wayland to the Berkshires  So  what’s not to love  Maybe I’m being prudish  but it’s the orgy of excess I experience each time I open the fridge  And  to be honest  it’s the forced match making with veggies I don’t love and wouldn’t choose for my dance card  Finally  it’s the pressure to process all that greenery in a 24 hour freshness window

Cherington is the chairman this year A few notes  t n   As Buster Olney and others have reported  there is an increasing sense that Pablo Sandoval will stay with the Giants  This is not great news for the Red Sox  but hardly some sort of disaster The Red Sox need a third baseman and the kind of lefthanded power the switch hitting Sandoval provides  But Sandoval also has seen his OPS drop steadily the last three seasons and his value is inflated by his postseason success Then there is the Carl Crawford Effect  Crawford fled the safe cocoon of the Rays for the big money offered by the Red Sox and was miserable  Sandoval is happy in San Francisco and the fans love him  He could probably make $20 million more going to the Sox  but is that worth the risk  Boston is a far less forgiving atmosphere than San Francisco    As the Red Sox discuss trades  shortstop Deven Marrero is hitting  320 with a  443 on base percentage through 15 games in the Arizona Fall League The former first round pick is a defensively gifted player who already carries himself with the confidence of a major leaguer  If the Red Sox are indeed serious about using Xander Bogaerts at shortstop  it would be wise to trade Marrero at the height of his value   The Red Sox are expected to meet with Jon Lester’s agents  Sam and Seth Levinson  this week  Unless the Red Sox have suddenly changed their mind about paying Lester what he is worth  it’s probably just a charade   Red Sox executives and coaches are sold on the idea that Christian Vazquez is their catcher for 2015  Blake Swihart has played 18 games in Triple A and recent organizational history suggests he should continue to develop there A bigger question is whether the Red Sox would be willing to trade Swihart this winter to build a contending team  Like Marrero  his value is there now The Red Sox are development oriented and rightly so  But at some point they’ll have to trade talent to get talent   If Sandoval is out of the picture  would the Red Sox fight with the Yankees to sign Chase Headley    Rusney Castillo has yet to play in Puerto Rico as he recovers from a thumb injury  So far his offseason has consisted of eight games and 36 at bats   Major League Baseball sent 29 players to Japan for a seven game series that starts Tuesday  John Farrell is the manager and his coaching staff includes Brian Butterfield and Juan Nieves But there isn’t one Red Sox player on the roster  Injuries were a factor along with a lack of interest on the part of some Farrell has plenty of talent  The roster includes Jose Altuve  Robinson Cano  Chris Carter  Lucas Duda  Hishashi Iwakuma  Evan Longoria  Mark Melancon  Justin Morneau  Salvador Perez  Yasiel Puig  Matt Shoemaker  and Ben Zobrist One benefit to the Sox will be Farrell and Nieves seeing Hiroshima righthander Kenta Maeda pitch in person  Maeda could be made available to MLB teams via the posting system Maeda has pitched well in Japan but profiles as a No  4 or No  5 starter in the majors   Remember Andrew Bailey  He has not pitched since July 12  2013 because of an extensive shoulder injury that required surgery  The Yankees signed Bailey to a minor league deal last season and he never pitched  According to Chad Jennings of The Journal News  the Yankees declined their option on Bailey for 2015 but will try another minor league deal   On Tuesday  Veterans Day  the Red Sox will reach out to some servicemen and women  Sam Horn  Wally the Green Monster  and some front office staff will visit the Roxbury VA Hospital at 11 a m  then the Brockton VA Hospital at 1 30 p m  The group will visit the Pine Street Inn at 4 p m  and meet with veterans there Free tours of Fenway Park will be offered to veterans and active duty military on Tuesday as

with murder in the June 2013 slaying of Odin L  Lloyd  27  whose bullet riddled body was found in an industrial yard near the athlete’s North Attleborough home All three men have pleaded not guilty

slaying but were in April During Tuesday’s hearing  prosecutors did not detail the evidence supporting the murder count against Ortiz  and a spokesman for District Attorney C  Samuel Sutter declined to discuss the factors the led to the upgraded charge Prosecutors contend that the trio picked up Lloyd in Dorchester early on June 17  2013  and drove him to the industrial yard where he was killed  The government has not identified an alleged shooter  nOrtiz’s lawyer  John J  Connors  said during Tuesday’s hearing that while “the charge has changed  none of the facts of the situation have changed ”Connors repeated that assertion after the arraignment “I’m worried that I have an innocent guy who was along for the ride ” he told reporters He did not answer directly when asked if Ortiz is now interested in cooperating with prosecutors  in light of the pending murder indictment “Right now  I’m interested in working toward getting my client found not guilty of the crime ” Connors said He also disputed one reporter’s suggestion that Ortiz could have avoided the murder charge if he cooperated with investigators at the outset “You really believe that ” Connors said  “You’ve read  from the affidavits  what he said down in Bristol  Conn    His story hasn’t changed since I’ve talked to him  What he said then is what he’s saying now ”Court records show Ortiz initiallywho interviewed him in Connecticut shortly after Lloyd’s slaying that he stayed in the rental vehicle in the industrial yard while Hernandez  Lloyd  and Wallace got out together Ortiz said he heard  but did not see  the gunshots  and that Wallace told him that Hernandez admitted to pulling the trigger  court records show However  prosecutors disclosed in September that Ortiz had changed his story and “does not think” that Wallace exited the vehicle In addition to Lloyd’s slaying  Hernandez has also beenon first degree murder charges in the fatal shootings of two men in Boston in July 2012  His arraignment in that case is slated for Wednesday afternoon  nOn Tuesday  members of Lloyd’s family  including his mother  Ursula Ward  attended Ortiz’s arraignment  Ward wore a now familiar pin emblazoned with a

influence  fourth offense  and motor vehicle homicide charges  t nHe pleaded not guilty and bail was set at $500 000 cash In court  Suffolk Assistant District Attorney Gretchen Sherwood said Mason smelled of alcohol and was unsteady on his feet when State Police arrived at the crash site on Enneking Parkway at about 2 30 a m  on Saturday His passenger  41 year old Lillian Grover of Roslindale  was killed  Her friends said she was the single mother of two children and that she had been experiencing some personal challenges In court  the prosecutor said that the car the 42 year old Mason was driving hit a ditch and rolled over before coming to rest against a tree Mason allegedly told police his tire blew out  which caused him to lose control  But Sherwood said he was also asking police what the punishment for a fourth OUI was  Mason told police he “was screwed ’’ Sherwood said Mason took a chemical breath test after the crash but those results are not yet complete  Sherwood said The prosecutor said Mason was convicted of operating under the influence in 1992  1994  and 2001  He also has been convicted of disseminating obscene material to a child  prosecutors said After the crash  Sherwood said  Mason tried to run away but was stopped by police But his attorney  Robert Tobin  said there was evidence to support Mason’s claim that a tire had blow out on the vehicle  He also said that his slurred words were a symptom of injuries he suffered during the crash He also said that Mason did not try to flee the scene “He was found 20 feet away in the woods ” Tobin said  “If he wanted

eight speeding violations and four surchargeable violations  Mason was charged with speeding in Boston and Dedham in three separate incidents over three years  between 1987 and 1990  In 1993  he was charged in three separate incidents for speeding in Malden  Revere  and Dorchester within the span of six months  according to the driving records  He was also charged with speeding in Roxbury on two

police  the youngest of ’s nine children tried to steal two cases of beer from Lam outside a convenience store on Dorchester Avenue Wahlberg hit Lam over the head with a wooden stick and  according to police  called his victim a string of racial slurs  He was charged with assault and battery with a dangerous weapon and possession of a controlled substance  and served 45 days of a 90 day sentence at the Deer Island House of Correction “Since that time  I have dedicated myself to becoming a better person and citizen so that I can be a role model to my children and others ” Wahlberg states in the

stellar ones  They know how to solve the problems that have bedeviled schools for decades  Who better to name qualities they’d like to see in the person who might bring their brand of success to the entire system  Here’s what they think the search committee should be looking for   n n Let’s just get this one out of the way  A lot of people in this city are crushing on the interim superintendent  They love his quiet way of getting big things done — like his use of a provision in the teacher’s contract to give every principal greater hiring freedom  And they especially love his humility  McDonough knows he doesn’t have all the answers  and he isn’t afraid to empower people who know more than he does  “I’ve been to so many meetings with  him  ” says Naia Wilson  headmaster of New Mission High in Hyde Park  “My voice is heard ”For Mary Skipper  the former TechBoston Academy director who now oversees the city’s high schools  the next superintendent would think of himself or herself as  “not being in charge of  but being   a partner in the work with parents  teachers  students  and principals ” Every successful educator will tell you it’s all about autonomy  not just in hiring  but in designing curricula  forming community partnerships  and deciding how to meet the strong standards vital to a great education  Educators want more power and resources shifted from Court Street to the school level  “You can’t in my opinion mandate centrally         ‘Everybody is going to do x ’ You have to say  ‘Everybody has to achieve this standard  how are you going to go about it ’ u2002” says Andrew Bott  principal at Orchard Gardens in Roxbury   With autonomy comes more accountability  State law mandates that the state’s worst performing Level 4 schools and charters be monitored closely  If they’re not up to snuff  charters are shut down  and Level 4 schools face state takeover  Other schools  and the principals who lead them  should face scrutiny as tough  “If you’re not serving our kids then you  should face closure  ” says Ethan d’Ablemont Burnes  who heads the Manning in Jamaica Plain  “I want a superintendent who will say that ”  Right now  we’ve got this icky us and them thing going on when it comes to district schools and charters  They’re all public schools  They all educate city kids  The next superintendent has to find a way to get us beyond this increasingly hostile divide  “It’s this false dichotomy between charters and district schools ” Bott says  “It’s really about getting kids great schools  Whoever is doing that most effectively will have         kids choosing them ” n As Carol Johnson’s tenure shows  things can get pretty hairy around here  Educators want someone who can come up with a clear vision  and stand up for it  even under the withering public glare  It’s possible  for example  that the new Common Core standards will mean lower test scores at first  That will bring some heat  “They have to have confidence in the course we’re charting  not go off in a different direction if scores are dipping ” says Mary Driscoll  principal at the Edison K 8 School  in Brighton  “They have to be willing to deflect the heat         but also hold schools accountable ” Fixing schools is hard  and it takes a long time  We’ve been lucky that superintendents in Boston have stuck around longer than those in many other urban districts  We need another long haul schools chief  “I want somebody who approaches this as a calling  and can make a five  or seven year commitment ” says Skipper  “somebody willing to stay in the trenches and make sure it works in our city ’’None of the hotshots thinks it matters much if that person is a man or a woman  a person of color or white  It is important that the new superintendent understand the city’s greatness and craziness  but he or she need not be from here  So there you have it  search committee  That’s the person you’re looking for  Piece of cake  right',

buyback program  The announcement has been met with some misperception of the efficacy of past gun buybacks Since its inception in the 1990s  the Boston gun buyback program has always had two goals  to eliminate guns from homes and the streets  and to mobilize all segments of Boston  including police  business  clergy  educators  and parents across all racial and neighborhood boundaries  to come together as a community  and thereby reduce fear  The program provided an opportunity for a citywide conversation about the role of guns in our lives  and gave us one thing we could all do  destroy one gun while working to possibly change one life  nAs a co founder of the first series of annual gun buybacks from 1993 to 1996  I manned the program’s hotline  and many callers told me about their situations  A mother from Charlestown  whose husband was locked up for armed robbery  was eager to talk about why she was getting the guns out of her life  She said her incarcerated husband had left behind a handgun and a shotgun  and her 14 year old — who looked up to his father’s gangster image in their housing project — was hanging out with the wrong crowd  and had his eyes on those very guns  Talking about her husband  she told me  “I’m done with him  and his guns ” Talking about her son  she said  “With him  I still have a chance ” For her  this was her opportunity to put down her foot and to reclaim her home  She not only received logistical instructions for getting rid of the guns  she was given access to neighborhood counseling resources for her and her son  A 13 year old from Roxbury told me her boyfriend was locked up in the Department of Youth Services and had asked her to hold the guns until he got out  She was hooked up with a City of Boston street worker  who disposed of the guns through the buyback program and then helped the young woman with other issues  including truancy and counseling  In another case  a friend of mine — a mother whose son had been murdered  and who fantasized about killing the murderer still on the streets — surrendered her gun to be destroyed and then became a powerful advocate for violence prevention and justice   n nWith each successive gun buyback we got fewer guns  but harder to reach guns  City of Boston street workers in contact with court involved young people told us that the program was an opportunity for these youths to get out of “the life ” It had taken awhile  but trust in the communities had been established  In addition  we developed a multi faceted approach called The StreetSmarts Initiative  it promoted the gun buyback program as just one piece of the urban violence solution  and called for such prevention efforts as the Louis D  Brown Peace Curriculum in the schools  forums to improve police and youth perceptions  a basketball peace league that brought unarmed rival gangs into the same room for healthier competitions  The biggest misperceptions gun buyback advocates are up against today are the same ones we saw 20 years ago  that buybacks are viewed as the only solution to the gun epidemic  No one is suggesting such a thing  Future gun buybacks could — and should — have more wrap around services accessible to those seeking help  Another misperception is that “the guns didn’t work  and the program didn’t work ” The guns I saw were all tested and in working condition  And the destruction of any one of those unsecured guns means the program worked  one gun at a time  What worked most  though  was that an anti violence movement was born in those years  one that was truly citywide  diverse  and grass roots  It included family members of homicide victims such as Tina Chery of the Peace Institute in Dorchester and Sandy King of the Charlestown After Murder Program  young leaders in Boston public housing who worked with children to create local “Toy Gun Turn Ins”  former gang members who turned their lives around  street workers  clergy  and even suburban donors to the privately funded program  Regular folks formed a unified citywide voice  imploring change  Everyone continued to do the valued work they were involved in at the community level  whether youth mentoring programs  arts programs  domestic violence work  gang intervention  or job training  But one thing brought us all to the same table  to a united cause  the gun  nWe destroyed 2 901 working firearms from 1993 to 1996  and almost 1 000 in 2006  And we perhaps averted some human catastrophes that only those of us who have been there can ever fathom  Like most people who got involved  I came to the gun buyback program for personal reasons  Besides losing four siblings violently to various root causes  and having witnessed my own mother survive a gunshot wound from a stray bullet  the most heart wrenching of all tragedies occurred in 1990 when a 13 year old died in our apartment as a result of a carelessly stored gun  My 13 year old brother was falsely accused of shooting his best friend and was subsequently churned through the system for a couple of extremely painful years before the conviction was overturned  The gun was a  357 Magnum   nOn the final day of our fourth annual gun buyback in 1996  a priest called the hotline from Dorchester  He told me he had been handed a  357 Magnum by a 13 year old boy who asked him to turn it in  For the family of that boy  and perhaps for another   yes the Boston gun buyback program worked  Let’s give other teenagers and parents looking for a safer life this same opportunity', '2014_143')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article',

veggies in a bowl  On the opposite side of the table  Bill Yosses  former White House pastry chef  is instructing the girls to pour their bowls of goo onto the hot plates  and a collective giggle resounds through the room as the yolky concoctions sizzle  This is the first time the majority of the 10 girls have ever cooked an omelet — a fact that Yosses  Sally Sampson  president and founder of ChopChop Magazine  and the Harvard Pilgrim Health Care Foundation are hoping to change through a series of healthy eating classes at several New England Boys   Girls Clubs   t nThe Dorchester program is part of the series  which is aimed at 8  to 12 year olds  The weeklong program kicked off in Worcester in early July and will continue in six Boys   Girls Clubs in the Boston area and eight in New Hampshire this fall  to reach about 200 kids total  The program is funded through a $100 000 grant from the Harvard Pilgrim foundation “There is a whole generation of parents across the income and age spectrum that can’t cook  so they do takeout ” says Harvard Pilgrim president Karen Voci  “So we decided to skip a generation and see if these kids could bring the skills they learned back home to their families ”Throughout the week  students learn how to make yogurt parfaits  deviled eggs  beanie burgers  and salads  Fall classes will add seasonal dishes such as soups and chili  Yosses  who worked at the White House from 2006 until June of this year  thinks adults need to give children more credit in the kitchen  “Teaching knife skills and cooking safety at a young age is crucial for kids to not be afraid of cooking when they grow up ” he says  “We emphasize safety in the kitchen and teach them the skills they need to not be afraid they are doing something wrong ”Yosses is no stranger to young kids in the kitchen  During his time at the White House  the pastry chef worked with first lady Michelle Obama on her Let’s Move initiative aimed at bringing awareness of childhood obesity  He says Mrs  Obama would have children over to the White House garden to help plant  harvest  and even cook healthy dishes to learn where food comes from  Many of the programs already in place at Blue Hill complement Harvard Pilgrim’s newest initiative  In the last five years  the foundation has started several programs at the club  which include providing healthy snack options  maintaining a club garden  training staff members to teach healthy eating habits  and introducing more physical activity  At the end of each class  students are encouraged to take leftovers home to their families in plastic containers handed out at the start of the week  Participants are assigned to explain to their parents and family how they cooked their dishes  “They feel a sort of confidence and responsibility after learning all of these skills ” says Sampson  “How often do you see young kids excited about healthy food ”Yosses attributes their enthusiasm to their age  He has noticed a curiosity and willingness to engage in something new at this age that is much higher than in students who are teens  “They aren’t too old to think that they are too cool for cooking  but they are old enough to understand there is responsibility that comes with working in the kitchen ” he says  After finishing the omelets  the girls gather around another table covered with chopped produce — both raw and cooked — of varying colors  All eyes are fi  on blue potatoes  which are a complete mystery to the wide eyed girls  “I don’t think I have tried a lot of the stuff on the table ” squeals 10 year old Denise Brito of Dorchester  She reaches for the blue potatoes and drops them onto her colorful salad  Others are a little more tentative about some of the mysterious ingredients  Sampson urges all the girls to try a piece of white jicama she gives them  Zyariah Sheffield  10  of Dorchester  seems to like the taste  “It’s kind of like an apple ” The rest of the students immediately

replacing them with his own appointees Walsh announced the move Wednesday in a press release that touted the new appointees but made no mention of former board members whose six year terms were cut short  For more than a century  the board that controls liquor licenses had been appointed by the governor  but a state law passed earlier this year returned the authority to the mayor  t nThe Licensing Board’s newly appointed chairwoman is Christine A  Pulgini  a lawyer whose family law firm in Hyde Park was adorned with large “Walsh for Mayor” signs during last year’s campaign  Pulgini  who recently moved from Dedham to Hyde Park  contributed the maximum of $500 to Walsh’s campaign the last two years  according to state campaign finance records One of the ousted board members  Suzanne Iannella  had a term that ran until 2020  according to the city’s website  Some of Iannella’s family members were supporters of Walsh’s opponent  John R  Connolly In an interview Wednesday  Iannella said she was told Monday she was being removed from the board “I really wasn’t so surprised ” said Iannella  who had been reappointed in June  “I understand that the mayor wants to have his team ”Walsh’s press secretary  Kate Norton  said politics played no role in the overhaul of the board Walsh  in a press release  said  “The changes we’ve made to the city’s Licensing Board and our approach to licensing across the city presents a fresh opportunity to support economic development across our neighborhoods ”The overhaul altered the demographic composition of the board  leaving it without a Latino member  according to Walsh’s press office  The change occurred the day after the administration released a report from an advocacy organization highlighting the underrepresentation of Latinos in city government The changes on the Licensing Board were part of a broader shake up the last few weeks at City Hall as the new administration continued to take shape nearly a year after Walsh took office  Other changes included the resignation of Robert Shortsleeve  chairman of Boston’s Zoning Board of Appeal  who said in an interview Wednesday he voluntarily stepped down “After 14 years of service to the city  I decided it was time to focus on other things ” Shortsleeve said Walsh’s scheduler  Pamela Carver  is moving out of the fifth floor mayor’s office for a new job at the Licensing Board  Norton said  Carver worked for Walsh when he was a state legislator and came with him to City Hall  Earlier this year when a reporter asked about women in influential posts in the mayor’s office  Walsh said Carver “probably has more power than anybody in the place ”Members of the Licensing Board  whose positions are regarded as full time  regulate everything from hotels to fortune tellers  but their most consequential power is over liquor licenses  which have long been contentious  Liquor licenses can help spur economic development  but the number is limited by the state  Liquor licenses historically have been difficult to obtain  particularly in lower income neighborhoods and communities of color Councilor Ayanna Pressley spearheaded an effort to overhaul the Licensing Board  a push that was championed by Walsh  The Legislature increased the city’s limit of licenses by 75 and returned local control of the board to Boston’s mayor for the first time since 1906  Pressley issued a statement Wednesday thanking outgoing board members for their service “We’ve increased the number of licenses  This is where the real work begins ” Pressley said in an interview  adding that local control will allow for more transparency  “I would love to see the operations of the board viewed online  and the overall improvement of community and resident feedback ”One of the other new appointees to the licensing board was Lisa S  Maki  a lawyer who lives in South Boston  Maki has worked for the city’s Law Department since 2010  according to Walsh’s press release The third new member was Keeana Serene Saxon  a lawyer who lives in Roxbury  Saxon had worked as general counsel to the state Executive Office of Housing and Economic Development  according to the release The members of the new board began their six year terms on Monday  Salaries are set by state law  according to the mayor’s office  As chairwoman  Pulgini will be paid $100 000 annually  and Maki and Saxon will earn $85 000  None responded to an interview request made through the mayor’s press office One of the other ousted board members was Milton L  Wright Jr   whose term ran until 2016  Wright is a retired first justice from Roxbury District Court who is well known in the African American community  Wright could not be reached for comment The third member removed by Walsh was Nicole Murati Ferrer  whose term ran until 2018  Ferrer will remain employed by the city and is “transitioning to a different role ” according to Norton  Walsh’s press secretary “Suzanne Iannella and

forced households across New England and the Northeast to spend an estimated 20 percent more for heat  squeezing household budgets  limiting consumer spending  and contributing to a slowdown in the

Association  a professional group in Washington  t nAs higher heating costs reduce the amount of money that consumers can spend on clothes  electronics  and restaurant meals  they are affecting industries that depend on that spending  Several major retailers  including Walmart  Macy’s  and American Eagle Outfitters  have blamed the harsh winter for contributing to disappointing sales and earnings Retailers across the country cut more than 4 000 jobs in February  according to the Labor Department  In Massachusetts  retailers shed 5 000 jobs in January  the most recent state statistics available “Spending on natural gas service  spending on electricity  spending on home heating oil has definitely gone up ” said Chris G  Christopher Jr   director of consumer economics at the Lexington forecasting firm IHS Global Insight  “That makes people more cautious after they pay their bills ”The impact is falling most heavily on the poor and elderly living on fi  incomes  Richard L  Baker  an 85 year old Dorchester resident  had hoped to see the last of his oil delivery man by now  but another cold front moved in  requiring another delivery  The cost  $661 35  nThat’s roughly a quarter of the monthly budget for Baker and his wife  Mary Baker  forcing the couple to put off purchases large and small  from eating out to a much needed chair lift  “This cold winter  it’s really

weather  Massachusetts residents  for example  burned the most  in nearly 25 years in November and December  the most recent months available for analysis  according to the US Department of Energy  nThe utility National Grid estimates its Boston area residential customers will spend about $140 more on natural gas this winter as the result of increased consumption and higher prices Phil Flynn  an energy analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago  said many natural gas and electric consumers have been insulated from this winter’s rising prices because utilities buy a significant share of fuels with long term contracts that lock in prices for several months  But as those contracts end  customers will probably see their rates rise “You’re going to be paying for this winter well into summer ” Flynn said What households pay for heating varies by fuel  In the Northeast  natural gas users — more than half of the region’s households — are projected to pay an average of  n$1 100 this winter  Heating oil and propane customers will pay more than double that amount  n“If you are using heating oil or propane  this is truly an emergency for you ” said Mark Wolfe  executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors’ Association Advocates for low income people worry that additional emergencies for the state’s poor will come in a few weeks  when utilities can shut off gas and electricity for nonpayment of bills  Under Massachusetts law  utilities are prohibited from cutting service between Nov  15 and March 15 — though the end date often is extended to at least the end of March  For many low income families  the bills have piled up “When the shut off moratoriums start to expire at the end of this month  we’ll truly know the impact ” Wolfe said Federal heating assistance might have helped avoid these situations  but the program has been cut significantly in recent years  The money distributed to Massachusetts — roughly $140 million — is exhausted At Action for Boston Community Development  which helps low income families in Boston  Brookline  and Newton apply for help with heating bills  representatives said the cold weather  high energy prices  and

never failed to deliver He routinely rigged hiring and promotional interviews  He handed out treasured state jobs  oh  those pensions   like chocolates in a box He made sure that House Speaker Robert A  DeLeo’s godson got a plum chief probation officer job  When the wife of one powerful politician applied for an electronic monitoring position  the other candidates were doomed By one account  he sometimes handed out jobs to politicians who weren’t even looking for them  an effort to assure that DeLeo would win the speakership in 2009  an effort that an angry DeLeo has called pure fiction  t nBut there’s little doubt that the hiring system was a farce  The process was phony  The candidates were preselected The system was rotten  and  for years  it was simply how the Massachusetts probation system operated Trial Court superiors who should have interceded  shrugged in resignation instead  O’Brien’s top lieutenants  men and women not without skill  far from blowing the whistle  took willful part in the fraudulent scheme And now  with the federal jury’s verdict in Judge William G  Young’s courtroom  the spectacular collapse of Jack O’Brien’s pugnacious public service career is complete His defense  simply put  was this  Hey  everybody does it  It’s called patronage  You take care of me  I’ll take care of you  A crime  you say  Come on  It’s a Commonwealth custom But this clearly hard working jury  after weeks of testimony and a parade of 60 witnesses  did not buy it Perhaps they didn’t buy it because damning testimony showed that O’Brien did more than help powerful people get jobs for their friends and relatives  He virtually commandeered an entire state agency  2 000 strong  converting it into his personal plaything This was patronage on steroids  And it was criminal “Fraud and bribery are not business as usual in the state of Massachusetts ’’ Assistant US Attorney Karin Bell told the jury  words ringing in their ears as they began deliberations She called O’Brien’s claims that he hired and promoted candidates based on merit “a bald faced  outright lie ’’If O’Brien’s ruinous downfall  played out across the last four years  was swift  his rise to power in the Probation Department was steady and sure And  tellingly  it was rooted in friendships and connections He played football at Boston College and caught the eye of John J  Irwin Jr   a devoted BC alumnus  who would later become the state’s chief judge for administration and management  which ran the state trial court system to which the probation agency belonged O’Brien grew up in Dorchester  not too far from Thomas M  Finneran  who would later become the speaker of the Massachusetts House Irwin and Finneran were the twin architects of his probation career  which began at Suffolk Superior Court  O’Brien was a probation officer there and was later tapped to lead the Office of Community Corrections  where he supervised a constellation of education and treatment programs across Massachusetts When Finneran was chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee and Irwin would lobby him for Trial Court funding  O’Brien accompanied the judge  who was not unaware that the Dorchester roots O’Brien shared with Finneran could not hurt Soon enough  Finneran was House speaker and O’Brien was tapped to become the commissioner of the probation agency where he quickly gained a reputation as an insular leader whose skin was thin and whose elbows were sharp In 2001  Finneran engineered legislation that stripped judges of the power to appoint probation officers  And when he handed that authority over to his old neighborhood friend and jogging partner  O’Brien’s consolidation of power was complete Perhaps O’Brien’s most corrosive relationship  replayed through volcanic trial testimony  was the one he suffered with Robert A  Mulligan  a successor to Irwin as the chief administrative judge and O’Brien’s putative boss When the Spotlight Team was investigating O’Brien’s agency in 2010  Mulligan told me about his icy first encounter with O’Brien in summer 2003 O’Brien was still bristling over a district court judge’s decision the year before to hold him in contempt of court  an embarrassing episode in which O’Brien was briefly confined to a Brighton court’s prisoner dock because he had balked at a judge’s order about drug testing procedures Jack was not used to being treated like that  He filed a lawsuit  claiming  among other things  post traumatic stress  And now he was out for compensation  “His demand was $300 000 ’’ Mulligan recalled  It was a stunning  audacious demand “Meetings we had were tense and difficult ’’ Mulligan testified at the trial  “It seemed everything between us became a contest ’’O’Brien contended that everything he did was approved by Mulligan  Indeed  trial testimony showed that in some instances Mulligan himself was not above using jobs as favors Mulligan was lampooned by defense lawyers as O’Brien’s “do as I say  not as I do’’ supervisor In the months the Globe Spotlight Team spent examining O’Brien’s tenure at the Probation Department in 2010  he repeatedly refused to meet with me  He declined to be photographed  He finally agreed to a single 30 minute interview I wanted to do it in person  No  he said  over the phone And over the course of that phone call it became clear why O’Brien did not want to meet face to face  The probation chief was clearly reading from a script  filibustering with facts and boiler plate statistics  some of which were clearly cooked  And he declined any questions of substance  No personal questions at all  please No  Jack O’Brien really didn’t want to talk to me  And  exercising his constitutional right  he didn’t want to talk to Assistant US Attorney Fred M  Wyshak Jr  or the federal jury either Through it all  Jack maintained that he did nothing wrong  He was just doing what everybody did  “I don’t know what anybody means by  a  rogue agency ’’ O’Brien told a reporter when he was suspended in May 2010  the day after the Spotlight Team series began When we were kids and my siblings and I trotted out the but all my friends are doing it defense  my mother  hands on hips  would point to the towering rusted railroad trestle over the Nashua River in the near distance beyond our back yard  “If all your friends jumped off High Bridge  would you ” she demanded That seemed to be the message from the federal jury on the fifth floor in Judge Young’s courtroom Perhaps that message began to sink in as Jack O’Brien  now a newly minted felon  stood solemnly before a packed federal courtroom Just because all your friends were doing it  commissioner  didn’t make it right In fact  the jury said  it was a broad criminal enterprise  n', '2014_970')","('no article',

US men’s soccer team may have shocked many with its 2 1 victory over Ghana in the World Cup on Monday  but at a soccer friendly bar in Dorchester  a group of their most prominent and vocal fans was not surprised From the kickoff  they believed  n“I believe ” is the mantra of the American Outlaws fan group  which has gained prominence in the runup to the World Cup through exposure on ESPN and other media for its devotion to the US men’s national team  The Boston chapter of American Outlaws carried the torch at The Banshee on Monday  and did the organization proud What’s it like joining them for a US soccer watch party  Well  I walked out with wing sauce  ranch dressing and general bar gunk all over my pants “I feel like I’ve been in a bar fight ” one patron said as she walked out of the pub following the United States’ 2 1 victory over Ghana in its World Cup opener When you watch a game with the American Outlaws  you become close with strangers  You high five with them  scream with them  hug them  and jump up and down with them  “I’m a good fit for this group ” said Brian Ledet  a New Orleans native who has been watching US matches with the American Outlaws for three years  “This  crowd  isn’t just for the World Cup  We’re here all year long  Whenever the U S  is playing  you’re going to get anything from 20 to 300 here ” nIf you’re locked into plans later in the day  don’t go to The Banshee with the American Outlaws  You’ll find yourself whipping out your phone midway through the match bailing on those plans so you can stay for more beer “I’m curious to see who the last US fan is out the door today  I’m supposed to be playing soccer at 9 o’clock tonight  and I already told my team that’s not happening ” said Fran Harrington  who helps organize the American Outlaws’ Boston watch parties and other events  “I imagine there’s going to be people here  if not until last call  until pretty damn close ”It is an easy marriage between the American Outlaws and The Banshee  which boasts multiple decals of the group’s famed logo  crossbones behind a soccer ball half covered by a kerchief  “They respect us and they put on the games years ago when nobody else would ” said Tim Westfield  who first found his home among the American Outlaws five years ago  “People don’t care about a random baseball game between the Twins and the Indians as much as they would care about a US soccer game ”The watch parties are open to all comers  But you should know a few things about choosing to spend four or more hours with these US soccer fans  nI skirted in at about 4 30 p m  and five minutes later there was a long line outside the pub  I asked the lanky door guy  who had a carnival counter in one of his hands  how many delirious soccer fans could be crammed into the bar  “I can’t tell you that ” he responded  in what sounded like an Irish or Scottish accent  “But we’re full ”Though that was 90 minutes before kickoff  Harrington said some of his friends got there at 3 p m  and he even knew a handful of people who arrived at noon for the early games  It turned into standing room only by about 4 50 with little to no wiggle room  nGo all out  No red and blue plaid shirts  Don’t wear baseball hats just because they are the correct team colors  Find yourself a USA soccer jersey — any USA soccer jersey — couple it with some American flag pants  a kit and a scarf and you’re good to go  The fans at the bar looked like they were dressed for the Fourth of July three weeks early — flags draped as capes  trucker hats with Abraham Lincoln  the Statue of Liberty and a bald eagle on it  bandanas tied as headbands and neck scarves  If you don’t go all out  you’ll be confused with the opposition  nThere’s stomping  There’s jumping  There’s broken glass on the floor  There’s bar tar  which is as gross as it sounds  There are klutzes  me  who knock over ceramic plates full of hot wings  There are sticky  well worn hardwood floors with a light layer of stains from past festivities  as with any good bar  Closed toed shoes that are well broken in with a good grip is the way to go  Your feet will take a pounding  nIf you haven’t belted out your own rendition of the national anthem recently  look up the lyrics and warm up your pipes  A well rested set of vocal cords is a must with this group  The pregame playlist included Coldplay  Red Hot Chili Peppers  and Oasis  all of which had the entire bar’s collective voice raised to a fever pitch  But those tunes had nothing on the patriotic cheers and chants  including the American Outlaws’ “I believe that we will win ” the group’s staple catchphrase that is set to a beat of clapping and foot stomping Watch for yourself  nClint Dempsey gift wrapped a goal one minute into the game against Ghana  His reaction  Jurgen Klinsmann’s reaction But the American Outlaws reaction was so loud  it echoed in my head my entire commute home Impressive collective lung capacity  But as high as the highs were for the American Outlaws  the lows — Jozy Altidore’s hamstring pull in the 21st minute  Andre Ayew’s game tying goal in the 82nd minute — crashed hard  too The energy in the bar was zapped after Ayew’s goal  but an optimistic group in the back of the bar downstairs began to shout  “I believe that we will win ” It spread throughout the bar  up until John Brooks’ go ahead goal off a cross from Graham Zusi in the 86th minute  Madness broke out before fans started to clock watch  which stirred up some stress as the Americans held onto the lead  As the 94th minute began  so did the chanting and game winning celebration As I stepped outside at 8 p m   my ears ringing  I overheard a fan sum up his first American Outlaws experience to his friends “That was quite the experience — it was horrifying  it was invigorating  it was fun ”', '2014_705')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article',

17 children of her own in Winchester  O’Reilly  it must be noted  raised 15 children with one hand  and partly because of it  When she was pregnant with her first son  O’Reilly  who was born without

no way she could see having a family as large as hers  “You couldn’t afford it ” she said  “And things are going too fast  Kids are too spoiled  My kids didn’t have a chance to be spoiled  Kids have the iPads and iPhones now  They’d all be in the house  They don’t play outside ”She also says fundamentals are in the way  Women have careers  she said  and don’t get pregnant early  The average age when US women have their first child has risen from just over 21 in 1970 to just under 26 today  according to recently released federal data  with nine times as many first children born to women 35

earlier met with Keolis to discuss how the company could promote diversity in running the city’s commuter rail system By the time the meeting was over  she said  she thought she had walked into a bad spy movie  n n“He started talking to me about how he was ‘below the radar ’ how he was ‘secret ops ’ ” Aun recounted in a phone interview  “He made it very clear that if we didn’t deliver on what he believed to be our commitment  he was going to make our lives very difficult  He knew members of the media  particularly in France  and it was going to be bad  He had the power to do all this behind the scenes stuff ”In previous discussion  “commitment” referred to Keolis’s assurances on diversity  But it took a whole new meaning when  at the end of the odd conversation  the veteran activist then handed Aun a sealed envelope nAfter Rivers left  she opened it and found an “invoice” for $105 000 for what it said were services rendered to Keolis by something called DRM Advisory Group  The invoice  obtained by the Globe  lists such services as attending a meeting with Keolis  $10 000   development of a strategic services plan  $15 000   and developing a nine point plan  $25 000  for Keolis North America to achieve diversity in hiring and ridership  It bore the signature of the Rev  Bruce Wall Aun immediately called Keolis lobbyist Michael McCormack  a former Boston city councilor who has been helping to introduce the French owned company to Boston “I told Michael  ‘I feel like I just got shaken down  Is this illegal ’ u2009” McCormack advised her to disregard the invoice  nIn a telephone interview with the Globe  Rivers confirmed that he had delivered the invoice  He did not discuss the specifics of the meeting  but said he was frustrated that Keolis was not acting on DRM’s proposals for diversity  Rivers did not respond to my phone calls Tuesday to answer additional questions about his conversation with Aun McCormack responded to the invoice with a strongly worded e mail  “There was never any contract between you DRM and Keolis for any ‘services’ and at no time during our initial meeting  subsequent meetings  or exchange of messages was there ever a discussion of money payments to you  DRM or anyone else for ‘services’ which appear in this purported invoice ” he wrote  “We did not expect to receive — and we certainly did not agree to pay — an invoice for services such as the one provided ”DRM  for Dorchester  Roxbury  Mattapan  Advisory Group arose late last year  after Wall and other activists became concerned that the black community wasn’t getting anything out of the proposed rail contract  At first  before the state had awarded the $2 6 billion contract for running the commuter rail system  some black leaders raised questions about Keolis’s diversity policies — a move seen by some as helping rival company Massachusetts Bay Commuter Rail  But when Keolis won the bid  the ministers struck up conversations with Keolis  the winner Keolis and the ministers held two meetings this winter  Subsequent meetings were discussed  but have yet to take place  The activists say they have gotten frustrated In an interview Tuesday  Wall described the invoice as a strategic gambit “We felt they were moving away from us ” Wall said  “So we decided that we would present them with the invoice  They would either move further away from us  or renew their commitment to work with us  We never really expected that they would pay it ” nWall admitted that the demand for payment was odd  even though the invoice bears his signature  He suggested that it was the product of a group decision  “I didn’t really understand the strategy ” he said  “How could they owe us money when we never had an agreement  My name was placed on it because I am the spokesman for the group  as of this moment ”The notion that Keolis should make a robust commitment to diversity at all levels should go without saying  As a company with no local ties whatsoever  it will need all the help it can get to accomplish that goal  Its contract calls for at least 15 percent of its vendor contracts to be awarded to businesses owned by minorities and women  Keolis says it believes it can exceed that fairly low bar  a pledge it should be held to Offering to serve as a broker to help provide diversity is a completely valid activity  Demanding $105 000 for agreeing to stop causing a company trouble is completely invalid The sides are scheduled to meet next week  But Wall said he would not attend if the meeting does not appear substantive  He added that he is considering stepping down as the de facto head of DRM  because he has not been able to deliver a deal with Keolis on behalf of the community McCormack  the Keolis representative  insisted that the company is ready and willing to deal in good faith  “We are committed to diversity and we are happy to talk to anyone to further that effort ” he said  “But we’re not paying anyone cash ”',

a restraining order in the past  according to court records   t n“Based on the facts and circumstances as they are known to investigators at this time  no charges have been filed ” the Boston Police Department said in a prepared statement  “The investigation remains open  but authorities do not believe the incident presents any ongoing public safety threat ”Officials have not named the woman  and she spoke to the Globe on the condition that her name not be used  A law enforcement official with knowledge of the investigation confirmed Jeudi’s name and said authorities are investigating the self defense assertion Residents of the Washington Street apartment said the woman was terrified of Jeudi and had asked them not to let him inside the building  They often heard banging and fighting coming from her apartment  they said “I told her  you better get some kind of help ” said one resident  who asked not to be named because she feared retribution  “Either he’s going to end up killing you  or you’re going to kill him ”Another resident who also asked not to be named because she feared retribution said she often heard the woman screaming  She once told Jeudi that a man who beats a woman is a coward  she said  and he responded that there were two sides to the story   t n“He’s been beating her up every week ” said the resident  “She was scared for her life  I was scared for her kids ”The

daughter’s room and she asked him to leave  Jeudi told her he was going to take their 2 year old with him  and she said no  she said  “He picked me up by my hair  and slammed me to the ground ” she said  He dragged her into a hallway and put her in a headlock  and began jamming his thumbs into her eyes  she said  He threw her into the kitchen  and she ran into her room  She tried to keep him out by bracing herself against the door  but he put her in another headlock and she began hearing her neck pop  “I’ll kill you ” he told her  she said  She tried to call police  and he made her hang up

into the kitchen  and he tried to take her cellphone  then kicked her down  She grabbed a knife and pointed it at him  she said  “He laughed  I’ll never forget his laugh ” she said  “He said  ‘You gonna pull a knife on me ’ That’s when he charged me ” That was when she stabbed him once  she said  Jeudi ran into the hallway  The woman followed him  calling 911 and attempting CPR  “I was telling him  ‘Stay calm  apply pressure ’ u2009” she said  “I don’t know CPR  I was pushing on his chest  He was already dead ”According to court documents  the woman had taken out a restraining order against Jeudi on Feb  7  2013  On Feb  14  2013  Jeudi was charged with assault and battery with a dangerous weapon  malicious destruction of property  and assault and battery for punching the woman in her head and knocking her to the floor  and then stomping on her  He allegedly destroyed her phone as well  The charges were dismissed A week after that  the restraining order was terminated at the woman’s request  Shortly afterward  the woman wrote a letter  which is included with the court documents about Jeudi’s assault and battery charge  that says she was not in fear of Jeudi  and that she needed his help taking their children to school in the morning so she can go to work Jeudi was also charged in 2011 with drug possession and three second offense charges of carrying a firearm without a license  but those charges were also dismissed after a judge suppressed the guns He served a year on a 2006 gun conviction  The woman’s mother said she had warned her daughter about Jeudi  but her daughter always wanted to give him another chance  “She’s the gentlest person you’ll ever meet ” said the woman’s mother  Many victims of domestic violence do not leave their abuser because they do not want the relationship to end — they simply want the violence to stop  said Toni K  Troop  communications director at the statewide sexual assault and domestic violence advocacy organization Jane Doe Inc  n“The person they fell in love with  the person they had the child with  is the person they believe is still there  underneath all that violence ” said Troop  The woman said she had broken up

misplaced  a report from the Boston Redevelopment Authority and the University of Massachusetts Donahue Institute says  Instead   argues  a better indicator of the economic vitality of the area can be found in its growing population of educated young adults — regardless of where they went to school  t nBoston’s retention of the students who attend its dozen of higher education institutions has long been a concern for local officials and companies  as the area strives for an engaged  youthful workforce  Public agencies and business groups have offered incentives for graduates to stay  including  and  to internships and job programs But despite the exodus of half of its student population each year  Boston may not have an issue with “brain drain” at all because the city remains able to attract and retain plenty of young workers  says the report   n“The more important question is how many younger  skilled workers are choosing to be in Boston and the surrounding areas ” said Dan Hodge  the director of the UMass Donahue Institute  “How much does it matter if they were educated at BU or Dartmouth ”About 150 000 students graduate from Greater Boston colleges and universities each spring  Over the past decade  the percentage of graduates staying in the area has stayed steady at 50 percent  even as the number of young adults in the area has increased  according to the US Census  The reason for this disparity is twofold  Boston’s colleges are expanding   from enrolling 86 000 in 2000 to 101 000 in 2010  and the area’s young workforce is growing “I think it’s terrific to have the incredible base of higher education that is in Boston ” said Joe Cortright  the director of the urban policy think tank   “It adds to the critical mass  The biggest attraction of young  educated people is other young people ” The number of 25  to 34 year olds — young adults who are more likely to be permanent residents than transient students  the report said — increased 2 7 percent from 2000 to 2010 in Boston  In all  the young adult population of 20  to 34 year olds comprises 48 percent of the city’s resident workforce  according to the  Whether they are educated in Greater Boston and stay or move to the Boston area with degrees in hand does not matter  the report argues  nGraduates of public universities were more likely to set down roots nearby  a  by the New England Public Policy Center at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston found  In New England  however  roughly 70 percent of recent college graduates earned their degree from a private institution The area’s most prestigious universities  including Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology  report lower student retention rates than other area schools  according to a  by the World Class Cities Partnership  Predominantly commuter schools University of Massachusetts Boston and Suffolk University both reported graduate retention rates of 76 percent for the class of 2005  found the World Class Cities Partnership  Graduates of Northeastern University are also more likely to stay in the Boston area  in part because of the school’s cooperative learning program  the study found  “A lot of the businesses try to establish relationships with students from these colleges even prior to them graduating ” said Alexa Manocchio  a Franklin native and Northeastern University graduate  “I was very confident with my degree from Northeastern that I could get an interview and a job in that field ”But the area may still not have enough jobs  or opportunities for specific lines of work  to employ all the young adults who would wish to stay  A reported 190 000 students received degrees in the Boston metropolitan area in 2011  with 153 000 obtaining a college diploma or higher  About 71 000 total job openings arise each year  and about a third of those openings require the skillset of a college graduate  according to the Boston Redevelopment Authority and UMass Donahue Institute report  nWhen Theresa Neumann was offered a job by Starwood Hotels and Resorts in New York following her graduation from Boston University’s School of Hospitality in May  she wavered  She had a boyfriend in Boston  and the majority of her friends were staying in the area  But the position in a hotel in Times Square was just too good to turn down  she said “At age 22  I wanted the best job to propel me into my career ” said Neumann  “For my specific industry   New York  is the mecca ”Of major US cities other than Boston  New York attracts the greatest share of Boston area college graduates  followed by Washington  San Francisco  and Los Angeles  according  by the Boston Consulting Group  Alvaro Lima  the director of the research division at the Boston Redevelopment Authority  says that with Boston’s strong young adult workforce  there isn’t cause for concern when some graduates leave  Though not in they local workforce  they add to the Boston area economy  says Lima “When you have global universities  schools like Harvard and MIT  you are recruiting people from all over the world ” said Lima  adding that higher education is an export industry  “Then  you throw them back out into the global economy ”If Boston didn’t export a significant portion of its graduates  the city would see a glut of doctors  engineers  and politicians  not to mention nearly double its size in 10 years  he says  “It’s a great thing for the city ” said Lima  “ The area  charges lots of money to educate students here  and then exports them to the world  Then   alumni  send checks back to their universities ”For graduates staying or leaving the area  jobs were a deciding factor   nKamaria Moore  originally of Dorchester  decided to move back to Boston when she graduated from Clark University in Worcester in 2007    n“I like the professional opportunities I have here ” said Moore  29  who currently lives in Quincy and works in the social work field  “I like the resources available to the people I work with here because that’s not always true in other places ”About 76 percent of graduates who call Boston their hometown stayed in the area following graduation  compared to 42 percent who came from elsewhere  according to the Boston Consulting Group Despite not growing up in Boston  MIT graduate Anika Gupta said a job opportunity and a network of friends who planned to stay in the area influenced her decision to stay here following graduation last May “I work in an industry where I could have chosen different offices around the country ” said Gupta  22  who works as a management consultant  “I made the decision to stay in Boston based on these other factors ”Finally  not all graduates who leave  leave permanently  Brian Smith grew up in nearby Woburn  After graduating from Boston College in 2012  he left the area to pursue a sports communications internship program  first in Colorado and then in Michigan  After two years away  he got the opportunity to return to the Boston area to work for Hockey East “I wanted to work myself back  but I knew to do that I had to leave ” said Smith  “I had to go out and experience other things ”', '2014_1035')","('no article',

city’s longest serving mayor for his unwavering commitment to the poorest neighborhoods  Bishop John M  Borders III  pastor of the church  told the approximately 50 people gathered  that Menino was a constant presence in the area  including during crises  t nBorders recalled that Menino urged him to hold a community meeting at the church in the fall of 2010  after four people including a 2 year old child had been fatally shot on nearby Woolson Street in a crime that shocked the city During that meeting  Borders said  “people were hurting  and crying  and angry” and demanding to know what officials would do to make the neighborhood safer “Thomas Menino was right in the middle of it all” that night  Borders said  adding that the mayor regularly told him  when speaking of public safety efforts  “John  it’s about the children  It’s about the kids ”Borders also noted that years earlier  when his congregation was struggling to obtain a bank loan for construction of the church’s current building  “Thomas Menino made a few phone calls” and urged financial institutions to reconsider “He said  ‘Look at their finances again ’ ” Borders said  “Look at the importance of the church in that community ”The pastor also offered advice during the celebratory service  which was originally planned as a get out the vote rally before Menino’s death  for candidates seeking statewide office  He said that if the hopefuls truly care about inner city neighborhoods in Boston  “then you need to walk the streets like Thomas Menino did ” One of the gubernatorial candidates  Democrat Martha Coakley  attended the service and addressed the crowd  She said in brief remarks that Menino proved “it’s not so much how you look or how smart you sound  it’s what you do ”Coakley’s Republican rival  Charlie Baker  did not attend  Other elected officials in attendance included Councilor at Large Michelle Wu and state Representative Evandro Carvalho  a Dorchester Democrat  Baker said he was suspending campaign events on Thursday and Friday because of Menino’s death  Coakley also canceled events Thursday  saying she would probably resume campaign activities on Friday  but she said she attended the Morning Star service when she heard later that it was being held Thursday’s service included singing from the Morning Star choir and a remarks from the Rev  Jeffrey Brown  associate pastor of Twelfth Baptist Church in Roxbury  who worked closely with Menino’s administration on efforts to stem youth violence  Brown said Menino always spoke from the heart and added  “When you’ve got a leader with that kind of sincerity  you’ve got a real jewel  Can I get an Amen ”The crowd responded with an enthusiastic “Amen ”Borders  the Morning Star pastor  also spoke directly to Menino’s widow  Angela  who was not in attendance “We lost our mayor  but you lost your husband ” Borders said  “Your children lost their father “Just allow yourself to grieve         and know that the whole city and the whole country is praying for you ”Also among the speakers was the Rev  William E  Dickerson II  pastor of the Greater Love Tabernacle in Dorchester  Dickerson praised Menino for his support for “those who were less fortunate in Boston           We have lost a political giant ”Dickerson also shared a poignant moment from earlier in the day  when he first learned of Menino’s death Dickerson was driving home from Natick  he said  where he had testified before the Parole Board on behalf of an inmate seeking release He said he received a text message from his wife that said simply  “My mayor is gone ”

to get drivers for the popular services off the streets “This is government at its worst ” Stephen Regan  a spokesman for the Massachusetts Regional Taxi Advocacy Group  said at an emotional and raucous public hearing  “This was all done behind the scenes  There has simply been no input ” t nBattles are raging across the country to regulate companies such as Uber and Lyft  Taxi advocates say the companies  which allow customers to request rides through a smartphone app  are operating with unfair advantages over other for hire driving services because they are not subject to stringent industry regulations Earlier this month  Patrick proposed that the ride sharing companies be   Taxi advocates saw the move as an effort to legitimize the services Cyndi Roy Gonzalez  the MassDOT spokeswoman  said officials expect to file the changes on Friday afternoon  The Legislature must pass a new law before the regulations can be enforced  Under the proposal  the Department of Public Utilities would regulate a new category of vehicles called “transportation network companies ”The New Year’s Eve public hearing at the Transportation Building often turned emotional  as cabdrivers blasted Uber and Lyft for stealing business away from them and threatening their livelihood  At more than one point  the Department of Transportation’s general counsel  Paige Scott Reed  halted the proceedings to remind audience members to be respectful  Many taxidrivers pointed to the high costs they must pay to operate  including medallion fees and commercial insurance  Chando Souffrant  a Dorchester cabdriver  loudly repeated that ride share drivers are operating illegally  and that Patrick and MassDOT officials should be ashamed  “Respect our investment ” Souffrant said  “Don’t treat us like trash ”Although outnumbered by taxi advocates  Uber and Lyft supporters Wednesday said the companies are a viable transportation option that helps both consumers and drivers Katie Kincaid  a spokeswoman for Lyft  thanked the transportation department for recognizing ride share companies as an alternative  Kincaid testified that she looked forward to a “fruitful discussion” on the regulations  and said she hoped the definition of “transportation network companies” could be further defined Meghan V  Joyce  the general manager of Uber Boston  also said she was submitting a written request to tweak the definition to make sure it encompasses companies like Uber  “By and large  we are thankful for this opportunity to get a regulatory framework in place ” she said in an interview Uber drivers such as Malden’s Margarita Bancy also testified in support of the companies  telling counsel for MassDOT and the Registry of Motor Vehicles that the safety of her passengers is her utmost concern “Uber has enabled me to earn money and provide my passengers with a safe convenient service ” said Bancy  who said she started driving for Uber after being laid off But MassDOT officials heard far more skepticism about the companies  with taxi supporters sometimes booing and jeering at ride share supporters  When Dawn Kennedy  a Lyft driver and recruiter from Quincy  testified that driving for the company “gave me back my dignity ” people from the audience yelled out  “Why don’t you drive a cab ”The proposed oversight comes as Uber has been in the headlines  Earlier this month  a man who worked as a driver for Uber   The company has said he had not been on call during the crime The regulations proposed by the Patrick administration would require ride sharing companies to conduct national background checks and bar drivers with convictions within 10 years for various crimes  sexual abuse convictions  and major traffic violations The proposed rules appear to coincide with what Uber and Lyft say they are already doing  The main difference is that they currently do a background check for convictions in the past seven years On Wednesday  several testified they felt those proposed regulations would come up short Frank O’Brien  a vice president with the Property Casualty Insurers Association of America  suggested ride share drivers operate without valid insurance because many insurance policies specifically exempt drivers who use their cars as a business Boston Police Department Captain Jim Gaughan  whose hackney carriage unit regulates taxis  said he worried that Uber and Lyft were not more forthcoming about their background checks for drivers  “We’re not able to ensure the public are safe when they get into those cars and that worries us ” he told MassDOT officials At times  the hearing resembled a rally calling taxi drivers to action  Andrew Hebert  a manager for a taxi fleet  got one of the loudest rounds of applause after he argued that recognizing the regulations would be a “death knell” for the taxi industry “I don’t expect that the men and women of the Boston taxi industry are going to go down without a fight

and February that included the shooting of a 9 year old boy  alarming residents  community leaders  and city officials “When that 9 year old was shot on Morton Street  I think that was a wake up call ” Police Commissioner William Evans said this week  “We’re putting our resources where our violence is  and I think it’s paid off ” nSince that early spike  violent crime overall has dropped 13 percent this year compared with the same period last year  a reduction that Evans attributed to targeted police work and a major effort to get guns off the streets But the deadly month of January  when nine people were killed  contributed significantly to an increase in homicides  with 23 killings so far this year compared to 16 at this time last year  according to police statistics  Police said many of the January killings were probably gang related On Feb  7  Janmarcos Peña  9 years old  was killed when his 14 year old brother  Juanly Peña  shot him in the chest in an apparent accident at their Morton Street home Evans said the year’s violent beginning inspired a crackdown on guns  with the city launching a gun buyback program that has so far collected 323 weapons  Officers on the streets have recovered 252 more guns  The city’s drug and gang units targeted areas where weapons have been found  he said  and bicycle units were deployed to violent areas  Since January  the monthly homicide rate has dropped “If you look at studies  it shows that it’s always the same places and the same kids that are driving the violence ” Evans said  “We really picked up our effort on targeting the individuals  It’s a matter of being out there ” nOn Wednesday  a man who had yet to be identified was shot and killed in Dorchester near Uphams Corner Overall  shootings have dropped by 26 percent this year  to 58 fatal and nonfatal shootings between Jan  1 and May 11 compared with 78 in the same period last year  according to police statistics Citywide  major crimes dropped by 6 percent in the same period compared with last year  Rape and attempted rape declined 26 percent  robbery and attempted robbery fell 11 percent  aggravated assault decreased 14 percent  burglary and attempted burglary plunged 24 percent  larceny and attempted larceny edged down 2 percent  Vehicle theft and attempted vehicle theft  however  rose 33 percent “I’m glad the numbers are down  but we still have a lot of work to do ” Mayor Martin J  Walsh said Evans said police are working to stem the rise in vehicle theft  which he said is fueled in part by a spike in thefts of motorized scooters  which are becoming a concern in the city because they are being used more frequently to commit crimes  including drive by shootings   nWalsh  Evans  and local leaders credited the collaborative work the city has done with community groups and clergy with helping to lower the overall crime rate “I feel like there is something special happening in Boston ” said Monalisa Smith  who founded Mothers for Justice and Equality  which aims to end neighborhood violence  after her nephew was shot to death in 2010  nSmith said that when she spoke to the police commissioner about the importance of officers at crime scenes empathizing with families of victims  he invited her to tell her story to police cadets Summer typically ushers in a rise in violence  and Evans and Walsh said they plan to focus on keeping young people busy with jobs and activities Walsh said the city has a goal of helping 10 000 youths to get jobs  The city is also adding about 45 new programs for youngsters to its summer lineup  he said   nThe city must remain focused on keeping summertime crime down  and not just react to dramatic spikes and then lose interest  said Mark V  Scott  a public safety activist and associate pastor of Azusa Christian Community Constantly staying on top of smaller issues like cellphone robberies and drug needles in parks is key to keeping violence at bay  Scott said So far  he

justice Shanna Shaw  43  was driving a Route 57 bus May 18 when it smashed through a guardrail on the Washington Street overpass  leaving the bus hanging over the highway  nAfter a brief hearing in court Tuesday  Shaw was released on her own recognizance  Shaw’s license was suspended last week at the request of the MBTA Transit Police Judge Dyanne J  Klein reiterated that Shaw is not allowed to drive unless officials at the Registry of Motor Vehicles choose to reinstate her license Shaw has also been cited by MBTA Transit Police for speeding  operating to endanger  and impeded operation  The citations will be addressed at her next court appearance on June 24 Shaw and her attorney  Gerald F  Malone  declined to comment after the hearing An MBTA employee since 1996  Shaw had originally claimed that she suffered from a severe case of seasonal allergies that had caused her to sneeze continuously and lose sight of the road  police said in an affidavit last week   nBut police said that footage from an internal surveillance camera on the bus showed that Shaw was holding what appeared to be a cellphone in her left hand in the moments leading up to the crash Police said the camera showed the cellphone flying from Shaw’s hands as the bus made impact with the guardrail  then landing on the floor of the bus  A passenger kicked the phone while staggering off the bus  Shaw  too  got off the bus  then got back on in order to retrieve the phone  police said “She said although she was manipulating the phone  she was not using the phone for calls or text messaging ” police stated in the court filing Under MBTA rules  train and bus operators are not allowed to have a cellphone in their possession while on the job  She has been suspended without pay  MBTA spokesman Joe Pesaturo said last week The video from the surveillance camera also showed that Shaw had another item in her right hand while driving  though it was unclear what the item was  police said The driver and seven passengers were hospitalized with various injuries  none of which were deemed life threatening  One passenger  64 year old Jerome Higgins  said he did not notice Shaw sneezing as she drove the bus The office of Middlesex District Attorney Marian T  Ryan has requested a copy of Shaw’s medical records from the day of the accident  when she received treatment at St  Elizabeth’s Medical Center in Brighton “The motion is made in good faith and is not intended as a general fishing expedition ” an assistant district attorney wrote in the summons that was filed Tuesday  “The defendant reported sneezing due to allergies  She also reported sneezing immediately prior to the motor vehicle crash ”According to Registry records  Shaw was involved in a crash in her personal vehicle in Dorchester in April and was found more than 50 percent at fault  She was also found at fault in crashes in 2003 and 1994  Between 1994 and 2008  Shaw incurred citations for speeding  failure to stop  and improper

“Mayor For A New America ” Most of those are legitimate  but a few may make some observers with long memories scratch their heads  We decided to take a quick look at some of the more questionable assertions  nHe endorsed Attorney General Tom Reilly in the Democratic primary that year  only grudgingly supporting Patrick after he  easily  won the nomination  t nBut in fact  it’s worse than that  Menino was a major driving force behind Reilly’s decision to nominate Marie St  Fleur  then a state representative from Dorchester  as his running mate  St  Fleur was forced out of the race a day later over personal financial woes  a stumble from which Reilly never recovered St  Fleur isn’t in the book  by the way  n Menino dragged his feet for months before endorsing Warren  As we all know  Warren won decisively  but Menino never played a major role in the campaign  though some key aides played supportive roles behind the scenes  nMenino was certainly far more gay friendly than his predecessors  his refusal to march in the St  Patrick’s Day Parade being the most notable example  But this claim is a bit embellished  The only gay man in his inner circle was Harry Collings of the Boston Redevelopment Authority  who appears in nearly every passage in the book involving gay issues  n Menino had chilly relations with the city’s major unions for much of his time in office  Certainly  that partly goes with the territory  Still  at one point  in 2004  he brought in former Senate president Tom Birmingham  a labor lawyer  to help broker peace  There were 32 union contracts outstanding at the time  and he was concerned that union members would embarrass him by picketing at the Democratic National Convention   Which  indeed  some did   nMenino’s political army was sent across the border in the last week or so before the primary and knocked on thousands of doors  But a Boston mayor can only do so much in New Hampshire  Clinton’s victory almost certainly had more to do with a strong closing argument in the last 72 hours  and voter skittishness about the then untested Obama', '2014_715')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article',

a mother of two  was indicted by the same Suffolk County grand jury that returned two first degree murder indictments against Hernandez in the deaths of two men who had a chance encounter with him in

driving a 2006 Toyota 4Runner loaned to him by a Rhode Island car dealer Last June  officers tracked down the silver sport utility vehicle to Singleton’s home in Bristol  Conn   where it was parked in a garage covered with cobwebs  officials said First Assistant District Attorney Patrick Haggan said in court Monday that Singleton was ordered to appear before a grand jury investigating the killings  n“The defendant        has material and relevant information” about the car and conversations with her cousin in the days following the killings ” he said Haggan said Singleton expressed concern that her testimony could potentially lead to criminal charges against her  leading prosecutors to offer her immunity in return for her testimony After a Superior Court judge granted Singleton immunity  she appeared before the grand jury  but all she would provide to the panel was biographical information  Haggan said “She stated that she intended to refuse to answer any further questions before the grand jury ” Haggan said Superior Court Judge Christine Roache issued a civil order requiring her to testify  When she refused  Singleton was sentenced to 120 days in jail  which she has since served

as faint murmurings amid the usual cacophony of the barn area   Tractors clattered as they zipped from barns to racetrack  Balky horses whinnied and jerked on their leads as walkers coa  them around stables  Two jockeys  workouts complete  traded playful insults A horse track  even one in a death rattle  can be a busy and boisterous place  t n“Bless us today and every day  oh Lord        ”  Alphen’s muted prayer echoed around the barns late one recent morning  “We pray for all our horses         we pray for everyone at Suffolk Downs         things aren’t over for us here yet ”Despite the good chaplain’s affirming morning devotions  thoroughbred racing at Suffolk is expected to end for good Saturday afternoon with the day’s ninth and final race  Opened for business on July 10  1935  the Depression Era track  the first in the nation to include a concrete grandstand  was dealt its final blow recently when the Massachusetts Gaming Commission opted not to award Mohegan Sun a license to build a casino at the site After 79 plus years and thousands of races  the track where the rising legend Seabiscuit won the 1937 Massachusetts Handicap and Dorchester sensation Chris McCarron launched his Hall of Fame jockey career is scheduled to lock its doors permanently when its off track betting operation shuts down in December  No one knows what’s next for the 160 acre site at the edge of the Atlantic  but in all likelihood it won’t include the horse business  “It just breaks my heart ” lamented McCarron  reached in Kentucky  “When I got out of  Christopher Columbus  high school in ’72  I went right to Suffolk and I’ve been on the track ever since  It’s basically the birthplace of my career  so this pains me a great deal ”Once one of 17 New England sites to feature thoroughbred racing  including 11 tracks in the Bay State  Suffolk ultimately fell prey to the nation’s ongoing cultural shift in betting habits  With the advent of state lotteries in the 1960s and casino gambling embraced by an increasing number of states over the last 30 years  what was once the exclusive betting domain of horse tracks has been systematically taken over  acre by acre  by the varied competition  A casino was Suffolk’s last chance to slow an economic freefall that track owners say totaled some $60 million in losses the last 7 8 years “There was a time in this country when the only legal bet you could make was on a racehorse ” said veteran trainer George Saccardo  standing aside his barn at Suffolk the other day  “The real horse players are going to miss it  And the people who don’t know racing  well  they never knew         “I just think it’s a shame to let the industry disappear in Massachusetts  It’s one of the few cities that has everything  Now you can say Boston used to have it all ” nIn addition to myriad newfound forms of betting  racetracks also have been hurt  many in the industry agree  by the longstanding tradition of breaks of nearly a half hour between races  Lottery tickets  printed by the billions  offer instant results  Casinos  chock full of slot machines and crap tables and poker rooms  are built for round the clock betting action  Ask today’s gambler to wait 25 or 30 minutes until the next race  That’s a huge task in a country where millions get at least one of their three squares at a drive through window “People lost the habit  OK ” noted Jim Hannon  86  a teller these days at Suffolk and previously its track announcer for 21 years  “There are too many other things on their mind  whether it’s the lottery  or the casinos  or whatever  “In the old days  when we were kids going to high school  nobody had a car  Everybody walked to school  walked home  walked to a job if they had one  right  Now  the kids in high school  they have to pay to park there are so many cars ” Pre  and post World War II  city based tracks such as Suffolk offered Saturday escapism to blue collar workers  many of whom had few options but to travel by subway  trolley  or bus  The inability of many to afford cars led essentially to a captive audience  many of whom were captivated by the so called Sport of Kings “Way back in Bill Veeck’s day there also was no simulcasting ’’ recalled Hannon  who was hired by Veeck  then Suffolk’s spirited and colorful owner  as track announcer in 1969  “So people  now  just don’t seem to have the interest  It happens all over the country  not just at Suffolk Downs  People are just doing other things ”The Beatles played a concert on Suffolk’s infield in 1966  with 25 000 fans streaming there to see the Liverpool Lads  the track still in its heyday  But it was horse racing that packed the place day after day each spring and summer for decades  On Memorial Day in 1960  a hefty 11 race card pulled in a single day betting record of just over $2 175 million  since broken   It was a healthy  robust operation  bringing together the everyman $2 punter and some of society’s biggest names “It was the place to go and be seen by entertainers  politicians  and everyone under the sun ” said Bob Temple  a former Boston newspaper track reporter who wrote the book  “The History of Thoroughbred Racing in New England ” “Just some of the people who visited Suffolk Downs over the years         Audie Murphy  the greatest hero of World War II  Willie Mays  Bing Crosby  The Andrews Sisters  Hopalong Cassidy  Rin Tin Tin  Mickey Rooney         “It was the place to be seen for politicians  movie stars  radio stars ” But the great Babe Ruth likely never made it to Suffolk  On June 2  1935  as the track’s $2 million construction project was wrapping up  the 40 year old Bambino was released by the Boston Braves and never played in the majors again  n nLegalized betting on thoroughbred races began at Rockingham Park in Salem  N H   on June 21  1933  and Narragansett Park followed a year later in Pawtucket  R I  In December 1933  Prohibition was repealed  The country still in the throes of the Great Depression  horse tracks and parimutuel betting were viewed as an economic stimulus in the years leading up to and through World War II  Tracks were busy  thriving entities offering scores upon scores of jobs  When Massachusetts roared into the game with the opening of both Suffolk Downs and Agawam Park in 1935  New England totaled four thoroughbred tracks  ostensibly a quarter of the venues that eventually would be supported in five of the New England states  Connecticut abstained   “To give you an example of how popular thoroughbred racing was ” recalled Temple  who at the apex of his Herald Traveler days was the year round track reporter at Suffolk  Rockingham  Lincoln  and Narragansett  “in 1958  Ed Costello  the sports editor at the old Boston Herald  wrote a story that those four tracks — Lincoln  Rock  Suffolk and Gansett — outdrew the Red Sox  Celtics  and Bruins combined  The Patriots didn’t start until 1960  “Think of those figures  They ran more dates  sure  but they also did it without the benefit of night racing  And they didn’t have Sunday racing until the early ’70s  So just four tracks  and they outdrew all those teams ”In three words  said Temple  he could sum up what sent the business asunder  “Changing         consumer         tastes ”“That’s my answer when people ask me why “ said Temple  now 70 and retired from a career that included 26 years as publicity director and handicapper at the Marshfield Fair  “The younger and the older generations prefer the fast action of casinos  As casinos and other forms of gambling have spread  the sport has just petered out  “They want to stuff their quarters as quick as they can into the machines and everything  They don’t want to wait the half hour between races “Veterinarian Richard Sheehan Jr  has worked at Suffolk the last 26 years  His father did the same for 35 years  beginning in 1963 “I’ve known the history ” said the proud vet during a break from rounds one recent morning  “And the glory days in the ’90s with Cigar and Skip Away         and the crowds         and watching Cigar come off the van with state police escorts from New York and the hundreds of reporters and cameras  Those were the great days ”Mary Donatti  89  was just 16 when she first came to the shiny new Suffolk in 1941  She remains a regular visitor on Saturdays  in part  she says  because she’s “always made money here ”“All these people  where are they going to go ” said Donatti as she stopped to buy a Daily Racing Form at Stewie Solomon’s stand in the clubhouse area  “There’s no jobs ”Asked if she cared to discuss things further  the sprightly Donatti said  “No  I have to study ” as she peered into her racing form to prep for her day’s first wager  nOf all the races he called at Suffolk  said Hannon  his most memorable was with McCarron aboard Waquoit in the 1987 Massachusetts Handicap  “A ding dong battle to the wire ” recalled Hannon  summoning the precise words he used that day  the audiotape of his call used for years on the track’s phone answering service  “McCarron lost the lead to Broad Brush  a big horse from New York  and then came on to win it  I mean  wow ”McCarron  who would retire as a rider with a then record $264 million in career purses  recited Hannon’s call from memory last week  By his estimate  Hannon’s voice went up “16 octaves” near the finish and all but perished as Waquoit finished in front of Broad Brush “We weren’t supposed to win that race ” said McCarron  59  who in December will retire from his teaching job at the North American Racing Academy in Lexington  Ky   n“Waquoit definitely was the local favorite  and I think half of Dorchester was there  at least all my family was  It was very exciting ”Decades later  one of Suffolk’s most successful jockeys in recent years  David Amiss  figures to have a mount in Saturday’s farewell ride at the East Boston oval “It’s going to bring a tear to my eye not to be able to come back here ” he said the other day  standing at the edge of the winner’s circle  “To see something that has been here for 79 years         “I look forward to coming back here every year  To see

Ortiz  28  and Ernest Wallace  42  were charged months ago as accessories after the fact in the slaying of Odin L  Lloyd  whose bullet riddled body was found in an industrial yard near Hernandez’s North Attleborough home last June   nBut on Friday  Bristol District Attorney C  Samuel Sutter’s office announced that a grand jury had handed up murder indictments against Ortiz and Wallace  both of Bristol  Conn  No explanation was given for the indictments  and Sutter’s spokesman declined further comment  Lawyers for Wallace and Ortiz blasted the indictments when reached by phone  noting the timing of the murder counts  which came roughly 10 months after their initial arrests  “Ernest Wallace did not shoot or kill anyone ” said his attorney  David Meier  “The nature and timing of this new charge against Mr  Wallace speaks for itself  One can only ask  is it based on the facts and the law  or something else  Ernest Wallace looks forward to confronting his accusers in a court of law ”John Connors  a lawyer for Ortiz  noted that his client was initially charged with a weapons violation  which was later dropped  He said he did not believe prosecutors have introduced any new evidence to justify the murder count “We started out having a gun  charge   then accessory after the fact  of murder   and now we’re up to first degree murder ” he said  “This is absolutely crazy ” n He added  “Is it because they decided that they’re not going to use my guy as a witness  and now they’re going to squeeze him with this ”Hernandez  24  Ortiz  and Wallace allegedly picked up Lloyd at his home early on June 17 and drove him to the North Attleborough industrial yard  where Lloyd  27  was shot multiple times in what prosecutors have called an execution  The government has alleged that Hernandez orchestrated the killing  starting by summoning Ortiz and Wallace on the night of June 16  But for months  only Hernandez was charged with murder  even though under a state joint venture statute  defendants can be convicted of murder if they were present at the time of a slaying  knew that a killing was about to take place  or aided or encouraged it in any way  Meier declined to comment when asked on Friday if prosecutors had sought the cooperation of  his client  Wallace  against Hernandez Connors  the lawyer for Otiz  said the government had never “given him any offers  as far as that goes  I’ve asked a number of times if we could sit down and talk about it  They’ve never given me any indication that this  murder indictment  was going to happen ”Rosanna Cavallaro  a criminal law professor at Suffolk University and former assistant attorney general  said Friday that the new indictments do not necessarily mean plea deals are out of the question  “Now that you’ve actually been indicted  for murder   that probably has a stronger coercive effect than the possibility  of a murder charge  looming  and not yet real ” said Cavallaro  who also practiced in the law office of renowned defense attorney Alan M  Dershowitz  But Gerard T  Leone Jr   a former Middlesex district attorney now working in private practice at Nixon Peabody  said either man’s credibility could be questioned if they testified against Hernandez only after being indicted for murder  He also said charging Ortiz and Wallace with the killing could make it easier to convince a jury to convict Hernandez for murder as a joint venturer   “It’s a much more difficult case to have Hernandez as the sole person charged with murder ” he said  “You have no joint venture theory against people who are charged with different charges and not the murder      You can try to proceed if that’s your theory  but if you think about doubt and reasonable doubt  the optics alone are difficult ” Cavallaro echoed those comments  saying that if only Hernandez was charged with murder  jurors “might be puzzled as to why he’s the one holding the bag  if all three of them were together ”Hernandez has pleaded not guilty to murder and weapons charges and is being held without bail  His lawyers could not be reached for comment on Friday evening  Arraignment dates for Ortiz and Wallace on the

Park twice  and nearly three times the number on long term unemployment in 2007  Nationally  there are about 4 3 million long term unemployed Americans  double the number from a decade ago  Many of these job hunters have extensive work histories and experience but struggle financially and personally in the face of repeated rejection  Three people tell their stories here      n n n grew up working  My family owned a business  Ward’s Laundromat in Dorchester and Mattapan  and I spent my teenage years there  folding clothes  making change  and troubleshooting problems with the machines  When my parents went away  my brothers  sister  and I ran the business  dividing up shifts for the seven day a week operation  nMy father was my first and best boss  He taught me discipline  the value of work  and the importance of doing a job right  I’ve followed and lived by these principles ever since But these values don’t seem to matter as much anymore  I was laid off from a job as an administrative assistant in 2011 and haven’t worked since  I’ve applied for scores of jobs at dozens of companies without success  At one time  I was able to at least get temporary positions  but even those have dried up The last two years have been the most frustrating and frightening of my life  My unemployment benefits ran out  and I’m burning through my savings and going into debt  I’ve cut my household budget to the bone  I even eliminated my Internet service  which makes it that much harder to look for and apply for jobs  Every day I go to the library  where I can get online for free I’ve found that jobs like clerk and receptionist barely exist anymore  As far as administrative assistant  those positions require technical skills and education beyond what they have in the past  My age also seems to be a problem as I find myself competing with younger people fresh out of college I’ve looked into furthering my education to advance my skills  but I don’t know how I can afford it  I’m already worried about ending up homeless  I don’t see how I can further increase my growing debt  nThere was a time when I could get a job with ease  I looked through The Boston Globe classifieds  circled the jobs that interested me  and made a phone call inquiring about the position  Eventually  I would get a call back with a date and time for an interview  and be off Most of the time today  you never hear back  I’ve had a few phone interviews  but  I have to admit  I’m really not comfortable with them  I have to keep reminding myself that things are different now But I also have to remind myself that I can do a lot of things  I have a degree in fashion merchandising from Fisher College and I worked for many years in retail for companies such as Banana Republic  Coach  and Ann Taylor  I have excellent organizational skills  too  I ran my own business for several years in the late 1990s and early 2000s  helping people organize their homes and lives Another lesson I learned from my father is not to feel sorry for yourself  I’ve had setbacks before and found a way to get past them until better times came  Even with economic and technological changes that only seem to happen faster  I know I can rely on myself I’m launching another business that offers a variety of personal services  from organizing closets to planning trips to shopping  I named it Fall Back on Me  I’ve obtained a business license  distributed fliers  and joined a social network to create a visual resume to promote my company  I recently landed my first client Over all these years of ups and downs  I have not only acquired experience  but also wisdom  I intend to use that  and everything else I have  to get what I want  n nen years I spent with this company  We weathered the worst of the recession  Then a new owner decided to cut expenses  and I was let go  along with four others With 18 years in industrial distribution  I felt confident I would find another job  I always had  I polished my resume  improved my interview skills  and embarked on a series of one on one tutorials to increase my proficiency in Microsoft Office  “I’ll soon be back on the job ” I told myself That was two years ago  I am 61  and despite a successful career in middle management  making decisions and helping companies prosper  I found I was quickly passed over by human resource specialists  I am like many older Americans who have lost jobs  We have much practical experience  We work hard to update our skills  We peruse online job boards  network  and contact companies  We apply for jobs  one after another  But  all too often  we hear nothing I had an interview with a company in Newburyport  On the phone  a young woman told me I would first meet with her  then the plant manger  When I arrived for the interview  she did a poor job hiding her expression when she saw I was not 25  She excused herself  came back in five minutes  and proceeded to conduct the “interview” in the lobby On the phone she called me Joe  Now she addressed me as Mr  Couture  She asked just a few questions “Why did you leave your last job ”Laid off “What were the circumstances ”Business was bad  others were laid off  too “What about the job before that ”Before I knew it  she was saying  “Thank you for coming in ” She hadn’t said a word about the position  When I asked about meeting the plant manager  she told me he wasn’t in the building  I offered to wait or come back another time  Her response  “I don’t want to inconvenience you  We’ll call if there’s any interest ”  Translation  Now  please go off and die somewhere  I am registered with 14 employment agencies  I check with each regularly  Sometimes I send unsolicited letters to companies where I know I could contribute  I learn the names of department heads  compose a letter to introduce myself and briefly describe my experience  abilities  accomplishments  and what I could do for their company  I ask only to be remembered when an appropriate position opens   I did get two interviews this way  After a while  it can get very discouraging  My unemployment benefits ran out a year ago  and my savings are taking a beating  I only purchase what I absolutely need  No theater  no restaurants  no trips I’ve spoken with people out of work for three or more years  These are good  professional people  who worked all their adult  and often teen  years  but were laid off for reasons not of their making  Their companies were bought  Their work was subcontracted to India  Or maybe the CEO decided he needed another bonus and downsized again When corporations get into trouble  it’s the people who come in every day to answer the phones  take orders  process invoices  assemble  package  ship  and receive who are considered expendable  while corporate officers award themselves “retention” bonuses  It can gnaw at your professional confidence  even your self esteem  But keep trying  Keep looking  Don’t let this brave  new world beat you down Every day  I read some drivel by some right wing pundit about how we long term unemployed are “milking it”  how we don’t want to work  how we prefer to have the wealthy support us  As Colonel Potter  of the television series “M A S H ” would say  “Horsehockey ” Most of us are active seven days a week  scanning computers  networking  and pursuing any avenue that might lead to a job I am not far from being able to collect Social Security  But I’m too young to retire  I have skills  experience  and knowledge built over a lifetime that would benefit many employers  I have a deeply ingrained work ethic that brings me to work on time  every day  and a sense of company loyalty that drives me to work with fellow employees toward a common goal Like many older workers  I have much to offer  Any takers  n nIn official government statistics  I’m not counted among the long term unemployed  But I consider myself one of them  I’ve struggled for more than two years now to find a full time job  make ends meet  and convince employers that I still have value in this fast changing economy and labor market I was laid off from my job in labor relations in March 2012  Five weeks later  I was able to find a part time job  working a few hours a week as a guest services agent for the port services company Intercruises Inc  to supplement my unemployment benefits as I looked for full time work in my profession  I knew the labor market had changed since I last looked for a job and the search could be long  But I did not bargain on just how long it would be  Part of the reason I expected to get back to full time employment in shorter order was my resume  I have a college degree  computer skills  excellent references  and many years of experience  My job search was careful and methodical  I kept a spreadsheet that tracked my applications  follow up efforts  company contacts  and results But after applying for over 300 jobs and getting 20 interviews  none of which led to offers  the process got depressing  I’m still doing it  but without that early sense of hope and belief that I was getting somewhere  The spreadsheet now has 420 entries  I have looked at the job search academically  I have read at least five books and countless publications on the subject  In addition  I have taken advantage of workshops through the state’s One Stop Career Centers  taken classes in Cambridge and Woburn on job search strategies  used local job club services  and taken classes about job search strategies  As a member of the 45  to 65 year old group  I know I haven’t been alone as my job search stretched from weeks to months to years  I have met many unemployed and underemployed workers of all ages holding bachelor’s and master’s degrees  including registered nurses and engineers  I mention these two professions because I find it frightening  Those careers are supposed to be recession proof  I am now piecing together three part time jobs to earn one third of what I made before I was laid off  I had to give up an apartment I loved and rent a room to cut expenses  I never eat out  travel  or go clothes shopping  I’ve canceled my cable TV and telephone landline The cuts that I and other unemployed and underemployed workers have made in our household budgets cannot be good for economic growth in our consumer driven economy  Nor can the loss of so much experience  knowledge  and productivity For nearly a decade  I worked in health care  coordinating admissions  helping both patients and doctors  and performing other administrative tasks  But I left the industry to fulfill my lifelong dream of getting a college degree  I now hold a bachelor’s in labor studies and management from University of Massachusetts Boston  so I understand how labor markets work  I have studied how unemployment can become underemployment once jobless benefits run out  I just never thought I would experience it firsthand', '2014_102')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article',

16 of felony motor vehicle homicide for fatally striking Doan Bui as the 63 year old biked home after a night of fishing  t nAccompanied by a Vietnamese language interpreter  Bui’s wife was silent in the courtroom as her lawyer told the judge that she and her children knew a long prison sentence for Ahern would not bring back her husband and their father Thuy Huynh  the victim’s wife  had asked for her lawyer  Andrew Barrett  to speak on her behalf “She doesn’t think any more damage should be done to anyone else ” Barrett said  “She has expressed  for the lack of a better word  forgiveness  and doesn’t see any advantage to any lengthy sentencing imposed on the defendant ”Suffolk County Superior Court Judge Christopher J  Muse also heard statements from the victim’s 14 year old daughter and 11 year old son that were read by the assistant district attorney “If I had a wish  I hope my dad would belong with us and drunks do not drive any more in order to not injure anyone else ” wrote Thao Bui  the victim’s daughter She and her brother  Diamond Bui  wrote that after their father’s death  they do not want to leave the house  They also described a hardworking father who took care of his family His daughter wrote that Bui had often helped his wife study English and practice driving  His son said they would explore the outdoors together during the summer “We and my mom miss him very much ” wrote Diamond Bui  nAssistant District Attorney Gregory Henning had recommended a sentence of six to eight years in state prison  “The defendant in this case is the reason Doan Bui is not here ” he told the judge  “This is somebody who should have known better ”Muse gave Ahern a 2½ year sentence  with 18 months incarceration  He also faces an additional year if he reoffends  or violates judge’s orders  within six years after his release  During that time  he will undergo alcohol abuse evaluation and take part in any necessary treatment  perform 500 hours of community service and will not be able to drive Daniel O’Malley  Ahern’s lawyer  had asked the judge for the 2½ year sentence  saying Ahern was a man who helped serve his community and had not been driving recklessly Earlier this month  bicycling advocates had applauded the conviction  David Watson  the executive director of MassBike  said he had hoped such convictions would raise awareness for drivers about watching out for bikers on the road  nBui had been riding his bike in the righthand lane on Morrissey Boulevard near Malibu Beach at about 12 25 a m  on Sept  14  2012  according to prosecutors  Ahern was traveling about 20 miles per hour over the 30 mile per hour speed limit when he struck Bui  prosecutors said Ahern called 911  He repeatedly told the dispatcher the cyclist had pulled in front of him State troopers said Ahern  who drove a Ford F 150 pickup truck  appeared to be under the influence as they spoke to him after the crash Video taken earlier in the day at a Boston restaurant that Ahern co owned at the time showed Ahern drinking alcoholic beverages and then getting into his truck  according to prosecutors Ahern had been previously convicted for arson in 1989 According to Registry of Motor Vehicles records  Ahern’s license was suspended after the crash that killed Bui  He has a separate  overlapping suspension for defaulting on payment of an August 2012 citation for failing to yield the right of way  He has a seven page driving record that includes multiple citations for failure to stop  speeding  and accidents  In 1992  his license was revoked as a habitual

record for an incumbent Boston mayor  nCampaign finance records show Walsh has already raised more than $1 5 million  an amount that nearly eclipses the high mark for his predecessor  Thomas M  Menino  whose top year was 2009  when he faced his toughest reelection campaign  t nThe new mayor’s fund raising prowess sends a clear message to potential challengers by underscoring the power of incumbency in Boston  where a sitting mayor has not lost an election in 65 years n“The idea of taking up all the oxygen in the room so nobody else can breathe is not a bad strategy  Money is like oxygen ” said Paul Watanabe  a political science professor at the University of Massachusetts Boston who served on Walsh’s transition team Since January  Walsh has raised more than twice what all 13 councilors have received  combined  He may be three years from an election  but Walsh has vastly outraised any other elected official who lives in Boston  including Secretary of State William F  Galvin  members of the Legislature  and US Representative Stephen P  Lynch In an interview  Walsh said his fund raising team has had a “very good year” and he described the haul as “testament to people approving” of his administration  Walsh rejected a suggestion that his swelling campaign coffers would scare off competition when he is up for reelection in 2017 “When people get reelected  it’s based on their performance ” Walsh said  “The people in the neighborhoods don’t care what I have in the bank  If they don’t see me and know I’m working hard for them  they’re not going to vote for me ”Campaign contributions have poured in from a variety of donors  real estate moguls  firefighters  developers  police  restaurant owners  teachers  executives  plumbers  physicians  bankers  and dentists  records show Municipal employees who work for Walsh have contributed at least $97 000  Donors who identified themselves as lawyers have given at least $126 000  Owners of construction companies  car dealerships  bakeries  and other businesses have donated a total of at least $80 000 “It’s no surprise ” said Ed Jesser  a longtime Boston political consultant who worked with unsuccessful challengers and City Hall’s longest serving chief executive  “The one thing I learned is the mayor is the king ”Through Monday  Walsh had deposited $1 510184 in his campaign account  according to bank reports on the website of the state Office of Campaign and Political Finance  The tally left Walsh $8 169 shy of Menino’s 2009 record Raising $1 5 million when individual donors can give a maximum of $500 is impressive  said Jeffrey M  Berry  a Tufts University political science professor  Roughly two out of three individual donors contributed the maximum $500 On Monday  Walsh’s campaign coffers had a balance of $950 000  n“He’s building a fortress with his campaign money  and he’ll continue to raise more money over the next couple of years ” Berry said  “By the time we roll around to election time  he’s going to have an unassailable treasury and make it extremely difficult for any challenger to defeat him ”Walsh’s fund raising apparatus has events scheduled through the end of the year  In the first two weeks of December  he deposited nearly $219 000  records show  Walsh and his longtime girlfriend  Lorrie Higgins  hosted a holiday fund raiser Dec  3 that drew hundreds to the State Room  which offers a panoramic view of Boston atop a downtown skyscraper Higgins’s role with Walsh’s campaign has grown significantly  On Wednesday  she hosted a “Women for Walsh” breakfast fund raiser at the Omni Parker House  “Standing room only ” one attendee tweeted After last year’s mayoral race  Higgins took a job with LB Strategies  a fund raising consultant run by Laurie Bosio  Walsh’s campaign has paid LB Strategies at least $155 000 this year  records show “I’m not Laurie Bosio’s only client ” Walsh said  adding that Bosio and Higgins are friends  “Lorrie  Higgins  does some of the compliance stuff on my stuff  but it’s mostly working for Laurie Bosio on other things ”Last year  Walsh raised $2 8 million during his bid for mayor  buoyed by scores of unions  which can contribute up to $15 000  far more than the $500 limit for individuals  This year  Walsh has not relied on organized labor Walsh’s unrelenting pace is a reality of modern politics  when raising money for the next contest begins the day after an election  Watanabe said “He’s not standing pat  He’s not assuming that he’s going to have the same kind of run that Tommy Menino had ” Watanabe said Walsh said he has paid off several hundred thousand dollars in debt from last year’s mayoral race  Records show that campaign expenses this year include $1 200 for flowers and sympathy baskets  $13 000 in charitable contributions  $500 worth of Bruins tickets  $170 for a bike and accessories for Little Miss Dorchester  and $50 for candy for an Easter egg hunt “I don’t think anybody likes fund raising  but I’m very happy with the year we’ve had ” Walsh said  “It’s not my main focus as far as being mayor of the city of Boston  My main focus is working on behalf of the residents ”', '2014_693')","('no

1 year old daughter  Zoey  as tears streamed down her cheeks  t nIt was  at once  a very intimate moment and a very public one Jackson walked through the door not just with staff and volunteers from Heading Home  the advocacy group that got her into the apartment  but with Governor elect Charlie Baker and a passel of aides  reporters  and photographers Baker  a Republican  has made tackling family homelessness a top priority for his first few months in office — combining empathy for people like Jackson with the sort of cost efficient policy fixes that were the central promise of his campaign But if his approach is winning praise in some corners  it is also facing skepticism from some advocates who say management improvements will only go so far in an era of skyrocketing rents and growing economic inequality “It’s poverty ” said Robyn Frost  executive director of the Massachusetts Coalition for the Homeless  arguing that a large scale investment in affordable housing is required  “It’s driven by sheer  unadulterated  horrific poverty ”The problem  whatever its origins  is sizable Massachusetts ranks third in the nation behind New York and California in the number of people in homeless families  according to a recent report by the federal government’s Department of Housing and Urban Development   State officials and some advocates for the homeless dispute the findings  noting that Massachusetts’ strong reporting system may skew the rankings  As of Tuesday  there were about 4 800 homeless families in Massachusetts  according to state figures — 1 743 of them living in hotels and motels because there is no space in an overburdened shelter system Baker said his immediate priority will be getting families out of those hotels and motels  which are expensive for the state and take many homeless children miles from their schools  “Our first objective has to be to reduce that number down to zero  and then keep it there ” he said Ultimately  the governor elect said  he wants to shift families into the sort of permanent housing Jackson took up on Tuesday Baker’s approach is multipronged  He wants to send assessment teams into motels to develop tailored economic stabilization plans for each family  he is looking to provide aid for parents and kids who want to stay with extended family instead of in hotels  and he wants to empower local officials to develop regional approaches to the problem Philip Mangano  a nationally known figure who serves as president of the American Roundtable to Abolish Homelessness  was on hand Tuesday He said advocates had learned what works — moving away from temporary shelter and toward permanent housing  providing supports for the formerly homeless once they are in housing — and that the trick is doing that work on a large scale Mangano  who served as the homeless czar for President George W  Bush  said Baker’s management expertise was well suited to that challenge  “We need those business principles and practices put to work for the poorest citizens of the Commonwealth ” he said Baker  who worked in the administrations of Republican governors William Weld and Paul Cellucci in the 1990s  said he’s had success in this area before  noting that the Weld administration shrunk the homeless hotel and motel population to zero at one point But advocates and analysts say the landscape has shifted dramatically since then Rents have soared  And the recession has done long term damage to low income workers  they say  leaving them in part time jobs with fewer state services to keep families afloat “These kids and parents can be made invisible ” said Donna Haig Friedman  director of the Center for Social Policy at the University of Massachusetts Boston’s McCormick Graduate School of Policy and Global Studies If the governor elect wants to keep people out of homelessness  she said  he will have to reverse deep cuts in cash assistance  food assistance  and job training  Baker will also have to ameliorate the “cliff effect” that kicks in when a promotion or a better job cuts off a low income mother or father from state supports  Friedman said She said Baker’s call for an expanded  state level earned income tax credit — a direct payment to low income  working people — is a good start But the governor elect  who has pledged to keep taxes low  does not seem primed to make broad new

years in which hospitals had little interest in expanding these services Psychiatric care has long been considered a drain on hospital finances  but Steward executives said sweeping changes in the way health care is paid for are shifting that calculation  The for profit company  which owns 10 hospitals in Massachusetts  has added 40 beds for adults with mental illness or substance abuse disorders in the past nine months  and plans to expand by another 30 beds this year — a total increase of 21 percent  n t nSuddenly  enhancing mental health services is not only good for patients but makes financial sense  too  Under new payment models  if large providers such as Steward can better coordinate care and keep patients healthier  reducing their long term use of medical services  the hospitals may also see their bottom lines improve “A significant number of the patients we serve need behavioral health care  and that’s why we are making this investment ’’ said Dr  Mark Girard  president of Steward Hospitals  Many patients arrive in emergency rooms in crisis  he said  “and can’t get out because there are no beds available’’ in hospital behavioral health units Steward’s strategy is part of a broader enhancement of mental health services across the state  Partners HealthCare  one of the largest providers of psychiatric care in Massachusetts  is embarking on a significant expansion that includes adding 53 beds  mostly at McLean Hospital  a psychiatric hospital in Belmont  and at a planned mental health facility in Lynn  MetroWest Medical Center has asked regulators for permission to open a 14 bed psychiatric unit at its Natick campus  nPartners and MetroWest said their expansion plans are not motivated by the new payment models  But they are among the growing number of providers realizing that it will be difficult to improve the health of large numbers of patients  a goal of the federal Affordable Care Act  also known as Obamacare  without addressing mental health and addiction problems  t nAbout 18 percent of children and adults — more than 1 million people in Massachusetts — suffer from behavior problems  depression  bipolar disorder  schizophrenia  or other psychiatric illnesses  and about 9 percent have substance abuse disorders  according to a report last month from the state Department of Public Health For reasons that are unclear  more than half of those with mental illness do not get treatment  the data show  Nearly 90 percent of people with substance abuse disorders do not get help  most because they do not feel they need it The number of beds in psychiatric specialty hospitals grew 5 percent since 2010  But at general medical hospitals  there was a slight decrease in beds reserved for treating mentally ill patients  some of whom may also have serious medical conditions  The health department’s analysis found the state has a total of 2 431 psychiatric beds for acutely ill patients  which puts Massachusetts at the top of states for inpatient mental health services  given its population  said Dr  Madeleine Biondolillo   the agency’s associate commissioner  The number still may not be adequate  however  for specific regions  within individual health care networks  or for certain types of patients Inpatient beds can be especially hard to find for children and teenagers  dropping from 310 to 250 over the last five years  according to the Massachusetts Association of Behavioral Health Systems  and just a handful of the new psychiatric beds are for kids Dr  Robert Master  chief executive of Commonwealth Care Alliance  a nonprofit organization that oversees health care for 16 000 disabled adults  said the state desperately needs more mental health services  but inpatient hospital beds probably should not be the top priority About 2 300 Commonwealth Care clients have serious mental illnesses  he said  and “on any day  we have 60 to 65 people in psychiatric hospitals all over the state ’’ Where they are sent “is highly random — it is the next available bed ” he added  “It’s irrational ’’Still  more than 60 percent of those clients do not need to be in a hospital at all  Master said  and would do better in a less costly and less restrictive crisis stabilization program  usually in a residence with around the clock staffing by psychiatrists and social workers Some patients wait for days in emergency rooms  even when hospital beds are available  because they are aggressive or have other behavioral problems that hospitals do not want to manage  he said  Community based programs would add more options “We are paying for the care in the wrong places ’’ Master said Executives at Partners and Steward agree that an array of services are needed  and say they are boosting nonhospital care too Partners  which says it annually spends about $50 million  ngenerated from other  more profitable services to subsidize money losing psychiatric care  is adding residential beds and embedding social workers into primary care practices  said Dr  Scott Rauch  president of McLean and chairman of psychiatry and mental health for Partners  It is also shifting some inpatient substance abuse treatment to outpatient settings Since Steward purchased the Caritas Christi provider network in 2010  it has spent $25 million to expand behavioral health services  including adding beds at Holy Family Hospital at Merrimack Valley in Haverhill  Nashoba Valley Medical Center in Ayer  Carney Hospital in Dorchester  and New England Sinai Hospital in Stoughton  nAt the same time  Steward has embraced new payment methods  Traditionally  insurers and government programs paid providers a separate fee for every office visit  surgery  and test — a system believed to encourage heavy use of medical services Now  more than half of Steward’s 1 2 million patients are covered under “global fee’’ arrangements  in which Steward is paid a flat  budgeted amount to care for a group of patients  Many other providers are moving toward a similar system  If they meet quality measures and stay within the budget  they earn a profit  if they exceed the budget  they lose money These payment models are increasingly including psychiatric care  Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts in January started putting Steward on a budget for its members’ psychiatric care as well as their other medical care  Steward said it is pushing the state Medicaid program to adopt similar arrangements Global payments give providers an incentive to “get a complete picture of the needs of a population and figure out what you need to do to keep them well ” Girard said  “We looked at the people who need behavioral health care  and saw a lot of claims going outside our network ’’When Steward patients get care outside the Steward system  it makes it more difficult for doctors to coordinate care for those patients — and to control costs  Opening more psychiatric beds is part of the solution  though some patients may still require care outside the system “Historically  it has not been the most profitable thing for hospitals to try to increase behavioral health services ’’ Biondolillo said  “Steward has been very clear they are trying to work on a strategy for these community hospitals to really take care of people in the community  To do that  they have to have the capacity to take care of anyone who comes into the ER ’’', '2014_1197')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article',

nothing illegal in dealings with Keolis North America  the company hired to take over commuter rail service July 1 under an eight year  $2 68 billion contract  nWall was responding to Globe reports detailing a $105 000 invoice that the Rev  Eugene F  Rivers III  another high profile Boston minister  delivered to a Keolis representative in March on behalf of the DRM Advisory Group  which Wall chaired at the time  Rivers was not a group member but served as an adviser  Wall said The invoice bore Wall’s signature  Keolis maintains it never contracted for the services listed in the invoice  and a company representative later told a Globe columnist that the meeting felt like a shakedown  with Rivers allegedly saying he could cause problems for the firm   nAt a prayer rally Thursday  Wall said the advisory group — which was formed to help minority communities and businesses obtain jobs  contracts  and other economic benefits from the rail pact — began developing a “working relationship” with Keolis in January “And we have documents to prove it ” Wall said  “The invoice submitted to Keolis was done on the legal principle of   that professionals are paid for value added services ”Wall  reiterating previous statements  also said the advisory group did not expect compensation when it sent the invoice  He said the group wanted to “communicate our seriousness” to Keolis  nAfter the invoice was delivered  Wall said  the group received e mails from company representatives indicating that “they want to continue to work with us” and expected to strike an agreement soon A Keolis spokesman did not respond directly to Wall’s assertion that the company had been negotiating an agreement with DRM  which stands for Dorchester  Roxbury  Mattapan “Keolis is committed to diversity in the workplace and in the hiring of qualified  minority owned subcontractors ” spokesman Alan Eisner said in a statement  “We have been and continue to be actively engaged in recruiting an ethnically diverse workforce ”In addition  Wall said that Michael J  McCormack  a lobbyist retained by Keolis  told him in January that DRM’s nine point plan for working with the company was feasible Among the provisions was a proposal for the MBTA and Keolis to “contract with the DRM Advisory Committee to guarantee access to contracts for businesses based in the black community ” according to copies of the plan circulated Thursday Wall also said that roughly three weeks after the invoice was delivered and days before the Globe   McCormack informed him that he wanted to bring a Keolis diversity officer to Wall’s church to meet with him Attempts to reach McCormack  a former Boston city councilor  were unsuccessful Thursday night An April 9 Globe column quoted McCormack as saying in an e mail that “at no time during our initial meeting  subsequent meetings  or exchange of messages was there ever a discussion of money payments to         DRM or anyone else for ‘services’ which appear in this purported invoice ”Rivers  who has denied any wrongdoing  did not return a call for comment Thursday Wall stepped down as chairman of the advisory group shortly after the Globe column

takes to get 55 units of affordable housing in a swanky neighborhood like the Upper West Side  who can blame   New York  even more than Boston  suffers from outrageous housing prices  And as demeaning as the separate entrance for tenants at the affordable units in the planned 33 story complex is  it’s actually a better way of meeting housing needs than the approach developers subject to affordability requirements sometimes take in Boston  which is to shunt low income renters into entirely separate buildings in poorer neighborhoods  That way of segregating renters rarely generates headlines  but it risks more serious harm Of course  the critics of the New York tower are right  The poor door is appalling and takes the  by New York’s affordable unit tenants to a humiliating new extreme  Although the developer in New York  Extell  hasn’t made the separate entrance part of the tower’s marketing strategy  the New York real estate world is rife with stories of landlords barring affordable rate tenants from gyms or roof decks  in the name of making units more attractive to the wealthy Manhattanites who buy or rent market rate units and apparently can’t stomach the thought of rubbing shoulders with poorer neighbors  t nWould it be better if rich New Yorkers weren’t such awful people  Sure  But those slights are  by and large  superficial  Boston housing officials are proud that a poor door would never fly here  because the city requires market rate and affordable units under the same roof to have similar amenities  But that’s only when developers are held to requirements to build them on site in the first place  Boston’s practice of  of affordable housing requirements  and instead pay for affordable units elsewhere in the city  has its own risks  Off site affordable developments reinforce economic segregation  And because so many city services are linked to geography  from schools to sanitation  it means low income residents miss out on amenities that may be available in wealthier neighborhoods  Indeed  many Boston developers build poor doors  too — it’s just that theirs might be located in Dorchester or Roxbury  making the difference between the treatment of market rate and affordable renters much less vivid  For sheer crassness  those units will never match New York’s poor door  On the other hand  New York City  unlike Boston  now forbids developers from building their affordable units in faraway parts of the city  So however ugly the Upper West Side plan is  New York’s approval of the project gives moderate income residents a chance in a neighborhood that would otherwise be out of reach  Boston’s history of allowing developers to move poor doors elsewhere might be easier on the eye  But if allowing the real thing would coax more developers into creating actual mi  income housing  it might be worth it n', '2014_453')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no

conscience remains at bottom unperturbed  whether the name is Michael Brown  Trayvon Martin  or Eric Garner  the unarmed New York City man choked to death last month by police after allegedly peddling unta  cigarettes  It matters not that unarmed Amadou Diallo died of 19 New York City police bullets in 1999 or that unarmed Sean Bell died in a hail of 50 police bullets in Queens in 2006 America remains unmoved to end these atrocities  despite unarmed Timothy Thomas dying from Cincinnati police fire in 2001 or unarmed Oscar Grant being killed by BART police in Oakland in 2009  Although Boston has not recently drawn national attention for police brutality  it cannot be forgotten how Accelyne Williams was literally scared into a fatal heart attack 20 years ago by a 13 member SWAT team  They burst into the wrong Dorchester apartment looking for drugs and handcuffed the 75 year old retired black minister  who died 45 minutes later For all their valor  police too often remain harsh emissaries of society’s soft indifference  agents more of control than concern  It has been 22 years since the late Rodney King  the most famous modern unarmed black victim of police brutality  asked the wistful question  “Can we all get along ” The answer is that this nation refuses even to attempt to understand itself  let alone to try to get along  nWhite Americans take a stunningly Pollyannaish view of inequity  despite worsening income and wealth gaps  a black male unemployment rate double that of white males  continuing job discrimination  disparate prison sentences for non violent drug offenses  and Obama era efforts by Republican dominated state legislatures to limit voting rights    only 13 to 16 percent of white Americans saw racial unfairness in workplaces  schools  health care  restaurants  or elections  When the general white population sees no disparities  it is easy to see how the police  in turn  do not see full human beings in their crosshairs  especially when departments are disproportionately white  in a seven year period ending in 2012  based on its analysis of available FBI data on killings ruled justifiable homicides  Nearly one in five of the black people killed by police were under 21  while only one in 11 white people killed by police were that young In recent years  video game experiments have demonstrated that police — and even college students — are quicker to shoot black people on the stereotyped perception they are more dangerous  Those stereotypes can be overcome with training  but in a telephone interview  one of the leading psychologists in this field  Joshua Correll of the University of Colorado  said the Ferguson tragedy is a reminder that “very few are doing this kind of training ”Very few do this kind of training because America has not yet retrained itself on its racial attitudes  There is no sign yet that Ferguson is inspiring national reflection  Only deflection  n', '2014_400')","('no article',

cities  according to a  released Monday The report  compiled for the United States Conference of Mayors  details the increasing distribution of income to top earners and projects an even greater wage gap in years to come  n t nOf 357 metropolitan areas studied in the United States  248 experienced a shift in wealth distribution toward high income households between 2005 and 2012  Albany  Ga   had the greatest change in favor of the high wage earners  while the Lewiston Auburn area in Maine had the 10th biggest shift  Boston  on the other hand  ranked 151st “The distribution of gains in those years has been relatively even across the income levels” in Boston  said Jim Diffley  the report author and economist at IHS Global Insight  an information and analytics firm based in Lexington  “Boston has done relatively better than other metros ”The wage gap is a focus for Mayor Martin J  Walsh  whose administration is working on ways to lift people out of poverty and strengthen the middle class in Boston  Walsh is vice chairman of the Conference of Mayors’ task force on income inequality  which held its inaugural meeting in New York on Monday  The task force plans to tackle issues related to early childhood education  access to technology  and benefits such as sick time  as well as housing  transportation  and workforce development  nIn Boston  Walsh has established a task force with the goal of ensuring that every 4 year old in Boston can attend a prekindergarten program  noting that these programs lead to improved success in academics and  eventually  the job market  An office of financial empowerment also is in the works to train residents in financial literacy and wealth building  In addition  city officials are talking to teachers and industry executives about creating a better pathway from high school into the workforce  working to beef up apprenticeship programs  and looking to build affordable and workforce housing “If we follow this road map  we will actually close that divide ” Walsh said at the Conference of Mayors meeting  “We won’t be talking about the haves and have nots  We’ll be talking about Americans who are able to make it  families who are able to make some money  earn some money  they will afford where they live  they will have good access to health care  good access to education  good access to housing  good access to transportation ” t nThe average median income in Boston was $72 700 last year  the sixth highest in the country  according to the Conference of Mayors report  and is projected to grow to $84 400 in 2017  The city has one of the highest shares of families making $75 000 or more a year  at nearly 48 percent  and one of the smaller percentages of low wage households  with 26 percent making less than $35 000 a year  The rate at which wealth shifted to higher income households was roughly equivalent to the national average Boston has not fared as well in other income inequality reports  A study byearlier this year showed that Boston has the fourth largest income divide between rich and poor among the country’s 50 biggest cities — behind Atlanta  San Francisco  and Miami  These results are more extreme than the Conference of Mayors report  study author Diffley said  because the Brookings Institution compared the top 5 percent to the bottom 20 percent  whereas the mayors’ report looked at a broader swath of incomes The nation’s growing income divide is increasingly being seen as a drag on economic growth  Last week  the credit rating agency Standard   Poor’s Ratings Services released  stating that the unequal distribution of wealth is hurting the postrecession recovery  Rising income equality leads to a less educated and less competitive workforce  reduced hiring  and fewer investments  according to the report The Conference of Mayors’ report showed that from 1975 to 2012 only one group experienced an increase in its share of the nation’s total income  the highest earning 20 percent of households  which rose from bringing in 43 6 of the country’s income to 51 percent  The biggest increase of all was in the top 5 percent  which increased from 16 5 to 22 3 percent  The bottom 40 percent of households  on the other hand  brought in just 11 5 percent of the nation’s income  down from 14 7 percent in 1975 One of the major factors contributing to the growing income divide is the high wage jobs lost during the recession and the lower wage positions that have taken their place  according to the report  The biggest job losses were in high wage manufacturing and construction sectors  and the biggest gains were in lower paid hospitality and health care positions  The average annual salary of jobs gained since the recession is $47 171 nationwide  23 percent below the average salary of those lost in 2008 and 2009  nThis dive in wages is much larger than it was following the 2000 2003 recession  when new jobs averaged a 12 percent lower wage than the ones lost Even people who have not changed professions have seen their earnings decline  Maria Barros  62  has been working at Logan Airport for the past 16 years  During that time  her wages have slid from a high of $16 an hour  when she was a security supervisor in 2002  to $12  then $10  and now $9 an hour for her job as a passenger service representative  checking people’s tickets and helping them with the self service kiosks  Things have gotten so bad that her son  Kevin  leaves money on her bedroom bureau to help her pay bills  “He puts it there because he knows that I’ll refuse to take it if he were to try to hand it to me ” she said in a report put out last year by Community Labor United  a Boston advocacy group for working families In several Boston neighborhoods  including Roxbury  Mattapan  and Dorchester  inflation adjusted yearly wages fell by more than 20 percent between 1999 and 2011  according to Community Labor United In an attempt to shrink the growing wage gap  Community Labor United is proposing a city ordinance to curb wage theft among Boston business owners  To deter unscrupulous employers from paying workers below the minimum wage or withholding overtime  every business that applied for a license to operate in the city would undergo an investigation for wage and hour violations  The message  said executive director Darlene Lombos  would be  “The city won’t stand for having employers in the city that engage in wage theft ”', '2014_130')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no article', 'no_id')","('no

reelection to the state Senate ” the Plymouth Democrat said in a statement Saturday morning  “It has been the greatest honor to serve the Commonwealth and I am forever thankful to the people of the Plymouth and Barnstable District for electing me to this seat time and time again ” nThe decision is not unexpected  Had Murray run for reelection and won  she could have only served through March 2015 because of Senate rules limiting its top official’s tenure  Murray became president in March 2007 State Senator Stanley C  Rosenberg  an Amherst Democrat  has claimed sufficient votes among his colleagues to become the chamber’s next president  nMurray was first elected to the Senate in 1992 In the statement  she referred to some of her accomplishments during her more than two decades serving in the Senate “From protecting children and families to reforming our health care system to supporting economic growth and development  it has always been my top priority to find the best solutions for my constituents ” she said Murray said she would serve through the remainder of her term and looked forward “to working on the issues that I am most passionate about for many years to come ”She did not say what she would do after leaving office  A spokeswoman for Murray said she was not available for further comment this weekend  nIn an interview  Rosenberg said he enjoyed working with Murray  and praised her as both a knowledgeable policy “wonk” and an effective  practical political operator “Some people are really great at the policy  some are really great at the politics  She has really been able to balance both ” he said The announcement was not a surprise  said Rosenberg  calling it a confirmation of earlier reports and statements by Murray to her colleagues that she would finish out her term  However  asked if the resolution of a question that had spawned rumors and uncertainty would be helpful to the Senate  Rosenberg replied  “Yes ”Rosenberg insisted he still has the votes to take over as Senate president  but said it was “way too early” to say what his legislative priorities would be as president “My focus now is exclusively on serving effectively as majority leader and helping achieve the agenda that has been laid out for the rest of this year ” he said Rosenberg likes Democrats’ chances in elections this fall  he said  despite a handful of scandals dogging the Patrick administration “We have a very deep bench in terms of municipal officials and people in communities all across the Commonwealth who are engaging as activists ” he said  “I’m pretty optimistic about our ability to see a strong majority ”Richard Tisei  the Senate’s former minority leader who is a Republican candidate for Congress  said he enjoyed working with Murray  even when they disagreed “Although we were on opposite sides of the aisle  I had a lot of respect for her  because she ran the Senate in a very professional and effective way ” he said in a phone interview  “At a time when you can look down in Washington and see how poisonous things are down there  she took great pains to make sure the atmosphere in the Senate was one in which everybody could work together          Democrat or Republican  everyone looked forward to going into work  and that’s a great legacy to leave behind ”Tisei  who has remained a friend of Murray’s since leaving the Senate in 2011  said her signature accomplishment was helping pass a welfare reform bill in the 1990s Governor Deval Patrick called Murray “a force for good in the Senate ”“I am confident that she will continue to make Massachusetts better — both in the remainder of her term and beyond ” he said in a statement House Speaker Robert A  DeLeo extended his congratulations on Murray’s “more than two decades of outstanding service in the Legislature ”“On legislative matters  such as state finances  economic development  and reforms of our welfare  health care  ethics and pension systems  she has been a partner ” he said  “On personal terms  she is a good friend ” nBoston Mayor Martin J  Walsh  previously a longtime state representative  issued a statement praising Murray  a fellow Dorchester

Boston born  Some were homeless families living in cramped motel rooms  others were single moms hoping to move their children to safer neighborhoods In the end  more than 10 000 people applied for just 73 slots  n t nBoston and much of the rest of Massachusetts are in the midst of an affordable housing shortage that shows few signs of abating  The rate of new housing production in Massachusetts is among the lowest in the country  within the booming downtown and beyond expected to make up the vast majority of new apartments built in Boston in the next three years  One in four renters in the state spend at least half their household income on rent — considerably higher than the one third recommended by financial specialists Housing subsidies have been slashed  shelters are over capacity  and the homeless population is than in any other state in the country  according to the US Department of Housing and Urban Development  More than 21 000 Massachusetts residents are homeless  a 40 percent increase in the past seven years Among them is Dineen Duro  31  who has been living in the Days Hotel in Brighton with her young son for two years  one of nearly 5 000 families the state is housing in emergency shelters and motels  She estimates she has applied for about 50 kinds of housing assistance during that time Duro knows the odds of landing a rental voucher are long  but she’s hoping for “a little bit of normalcy ”  n“This way  me and my son aren’t crammed into one tiny little room ” she said  “And this way I can actually cook dinner  There’s not much you can do with a microwave ”Duro said she is in a daily substance abuse program to kick her painkiller habit  and hasn’t been able to find a job that fits into that schedule She went to the Metropolitan Boston Housing Partnership office earlier this month wearing a red bandana over her hair  nose pierced and eyes dramatically lined to apply for one of the slots in the Massachusetts Rental Voucher Program  The recipients  chosen by lottery  will be notified next week  nThe state has 6 600 rental vouchers to help low income families pay for apartments  a third of what it had in the early 1990s  due to budget cuts  according to Massachusetts housing officials  The number of vouchers has risen modestly over the last few years  but not nearly enough to keep up with demand Residents awarded a voucher pay up to 40 percent of their income toward rent  and the voucher  which can be used only at lower priced units  covers the rest  To qualify  a household must make less than 50 percent of the median income of Boston area residents   below $42 350 a year for a three person household  The average annual income of families who currently have vouchers  $13 000 “The situation continues to worsen for families at the lowest income levels ” said Chris Norris  executive director of the Metropolitan Boston Housing Partnership  “Our fear is that if we don’t get more resources  the state rental voucher wait list will look like our Section 8 wait list  which is 11 years long ” nSection 8  a federal housing voucher program  limits monthly rent payments of low income families to 30 percent of gross income  Last year  budget cuts eliminated more than 1 400 of the state’s Section 8 vouchers  making the shortage more acute  nFederal funds for building affordable housing in the state were also sliced in half last year  The Boston Housing Authority has a wait list of 40 000 households for 15 000 subsidized units Massachusetts does more for low income residents in need of housing than many other states  said Aaron Gornstein  the state’s undersecretary of Housing and Community Development  It is one of the only states that fund public housing  for instance  and has a program to preserve affordable units Still  many families are struggling to keep a roof over their heads Marta Diaz  44  has lived in public housing in Dorchester for 17 years  and currently shares her four bedroom apartment with three daughters and two grandchildren  But the neighborhood is unsafe and the apartment is run down  said Diaz  who is about to be laid off from her nursing home job in Brookline “The crime rate is so high ” said Diaz  who was filling out an application for one of the newly available rental vouchers  “I don’t have the money to afford somewhere else to live ”To help meet the growing need in Boston  Mayor Martin J  Walsh has committed to creating 6 500 new units by 2030 aimed at families making less than 60 percent of the median income — with a quarter of those designated for even lower income households The annual median income for a renter in Boston is around $35 000  or about $3 000 a month  according to Michael E  Stone  professor emeritus of community planning at the University of Massachusetts Boston  The average rent for a one bedroom apartment in the city is almost $2 000 a month Richard Beaupre is another of the 10 000 applicants waiting anxiously to see whether he will win a voucher  Beaupre  28  has been living in the New Englander Motor Court nin Malden with his fiancee and two daughters  ages 1 and 2  since February  and he’s desperate to get out The family sleeps on two beds pushed together  Their clothes are in suitcases  their pasta dinners are boiled in the microwave  Beaupre  who was laid off from a retail job and then evicted from his apartment  walks 2

has weighed in on why he wants one and whether he deserves it ‘‘Everyone has an opinion and has a reason why they think I’m doing it ’’ said the actor Wednesday at the New York premiere of his new movie ‘‘The Gambler ’’ opening Dec  25  t n‘‘I’ve been working very hard to correct a lot of mistakes that I made since the day that I woke up and realized  ‘You know what  I need to be a leader instead of a follower ’’’ he said A document was filed Nov  26 requesting the pardon  It states in 1988  when Wahlberg was 16  he hit a man in the head with a wooden stick while trying to steal two cases of alcohol in front of a convenience store near his family’s home in the Dorchester section of Boston  He punched another man in the face while trying to avoid police Wahlberg admits in the application that he was high on marijuana and narcotics at the time He ended up being convicted as an adult of assault and other charges  and he was sentenced to three months in jail  He said he was released after serving about 45 days Wahlberg  43  who went on to be a rapper and then A list actor who’s been nominated for an Oscar  said he isn’t trying to use his public persona to sway the decision ‘‘In no way shape or form was I trying to use my celebrity or success to say  ‘Well  I feel entitled to get this because of the fame and fortune ’’’Instead he said ‘‘Every day I wake up trying to be the best person I can be ’’He also tries to set an example for kids growing up in tough neighborhoods like he did ‘‘I’ve worked really hard to be a positive influence for kids growing up in communities like mine who don’t really have a chance  and try to provide an opportunity for them to be more successful and that’s why I’m doing it ’’The actor said he’s never shied away from talking about his troubled past ‘‘And it’s not like the story hasn’t been talked about  I’ve been talking about it for 25 years  You read any piece that’s ever been done on me it’s really the same old kind of story and for me to kind of be able to move on from that and move forward and continue to show kids that anything’s possible ’’The Massachusetts Parole Board would have to review Wahlberg’s case and make a recommendation to the governor  who can grant pardons Pardons rarely are issued in Massachusetts  Gov  Deval Patrick has not approved one in his nearly two terms in office  Nor did

any father busy  But each spring  as longtime director of the Boston Marathon  McGillivray finds that his horde grows to thousands He feels an almost paternal responsibility for each of his runners  never so much as this year’s field of 36 000 men and women  ranging in age from 18 to 83  All the runners matter to him  from the first one to fly over the finish line to the last one to straggle in  nTwo years ago  the Marathon nearly melted in 89 degree weather  with 200 runners taken to the hospital and hundreds more treated in the medical tent  But last year  with perfect running weather  McGillivray recalls having few worries  Then the bombs went off In ways large and small  it will be a different Marathon this year  and as April 21 approaches  McGillivray is a different man  The Boston Athletic Association race director  he has overseen 26 Boston Marathons  but never one quite like this  The logistics of putting on one of the world’s highest profile races have been transformed  and no one is more aware of that than he is   n“I’m anxious ” he says  sitting in his home office in North Andover on a recent morning  “I feel confident in what we can control  but there’s so much more that happens around it  We’ve got 26 2 miles of road  both sides of the street  so about 52 miles  That’s a lot of real estate ”From a personal standpoint  there is one big difference in this year’s Marathon for McGillivray  His family won’t be there  Last year  his wife  Katie  was in the bleachers with their then 7 year old son and 9 year old daughter “We saw both explosions ” says Katie  “They’ve expressed fear about going back ”This year  along with their 4 year old daughter  she and the kids will do “something totally different ”“We’ll either go away or have a party here at the house and watch it on TV ” Katie says  “I’ll be happy when it’s done ” Before then  McGillivray must tend to a multitude of other details  each creating ripples of its own  One of the biggest changes is that runners won’t be able to carry or stow bags on buses traveling to the starting line in Hopkinton and back to the finish  McGillivray  knowing spent runners will need something to warm them at the finish  is making sure each runner is presented with a lined  hooded poncho at the end of the race  Made by a California based company called Advanced Flexible Materials  the thousands of ponchos  which cost about $7 each  will be stored in containers on Boylston Street beyond the finish line “If there’s cold weather  they’ll cross the finish line and have no gear to put on ” he says  “We felt obligated to give the runners something with more warmth and protection from the elements ” nAmong other changes is the addition of a fourth wave of runners at the starting line to accommodate the increased field  9 000 more runners will participate than last year  There will be public address systems at the 24 water stations along the course for race announcements  runners stopped in place last year had no idea what was going on  or where to go  At 6 a m  the morning of the race  130 National Guard soldiers will march the entire course  More doctors and nurses will be available throughout the event  and 10 000 volunteers will be on hand — 2 000 more than last year  On the Saturday before Marathon Monday  10 000 runners will participate in a 5K run starting at the Boston Common and at Copley Square Park  and 2 000 people — survivors  families  friends  first responders — will do a 1 mile Tribute Walk Run  And those are just a few of the major race adjustments  The more mundane issues — the 1 000 portable toilets  108 000 safety pins  1 4 million paper cups  4 000 Band Aids  900 IV bags for dehydration  26 oxygen tanks — are no less formidable McGillivray is a high energy type who speaks with his hands  which are in constant motion  He says he doesn’t need much sleep and is often up in the middle of the night pondering race details  He doesn’t do it alone  of course  He works with staff at the BAA  which sponsors the race  and with his employees at Dave McGillivray Sports Enterprises   nwhich he founded in 1980 to work on athletic events throughout the world — 30 of them  including Boston  which he works on year round  He’s paid by the BAA  of course  and says he is already working on the 2015 Boston Marathon  Katie McGillivray  his wife of 10 years  says he loves the work  always has  But she notes  “there are a lot more layers this year ” nBeyond the logistical and emotional challenges of mounting the race in the wake of the bombings  McGillivray has been dealing with serious health issues  In October  he learned he has severe artery and vein blockage and chronic heart disease — despite a lifetime of long distance running  nearly 150 000 miles and counting Since his diagnosis  he has changed his diet and shed 27 pounds  now weighing in at a lean 128   He jokes that he’s 5  feet 5  inches tall “on a good day ” McGillivray has also lost some of his innocence about the prestigious race he oversees “It’s not like starting all over again ” he says  “but we’re assuming nothing  We have to spend a lot of time going through all the details ”If there is a face of the Boston Marathon  it belongs to the wiry 59 year old who  besides directing the race for the past quarter century  has run in it for 41 years  He always starts off a few hours after most of the runners are in  Last year  he ran it 11 days later To say he takes the race personally is an understatement  For him  it’s not work  it’s a passion  and he speaks of it in superlatives  “To be involved in an event that has the most experienced and dedicated professionals who produce arguably the greatest marathon in the world is a unique and coveted privilege ” he says After the bombs exploded  McGillivray rushed to the finish line and showed police officers his ID card  “This is my race ” he said “Even you can’t go in ” he was told Running has been his life since he was a kid growing up in Medford  In 1978  he ran 3 452 miles across the country  averaging 43 miles a day for 80 days  to raise money for the Jimmy Fund  nHe doesn’t just run in various races  he also  them  or many of them  and has raised millions of dollars for charity  McGillivray’s home office is a shrine to his sporting life  the walls covered with plaques and photos  A coat rack is draped with hundreds of medals  Trophies vie for position  A replica of the blue and yellow Boston Marathon finish line serves as a welcome mat   “I guess you’d call this my man cave or ego room ” he says wryly  dressed in his trademark running pants and a blue “Boston” T shirt  Framed in a far corner is the Sports Illustrated cover of The Boston Globe photo that shows an older Marathon runner thrown to the ground by the blast  with three police officers approaching Though McGillivray doesn’t give specifics  he says he has remained in touch with some of the bombing victims  including Jeff Bauman  who lost both legs   nHe remembers the mood at the start of last year’s race was good  though poignant  “We had a 26 second moment of silence to remember the 26 victims of Sandy Hook Elementary School ’’ he says  “As I look back and think that only five hours later we were going to undergo our own tragedy  it’s still overwhelming ”Indeed  it is still hard for McGillivray to grasp that the unthinkable happened last April  He knows the eyes of the world will be on Boston this year  “ I t’s different  for sure ” he says  “There are a lot of unknowns  There’s more people involved  especially in public safety ” nSpecial invitations to run the Marathon were extended to survivors and family members  including Bill and Denise Richard of Dorchester  whose 8 year old son  Martin  was killed  Their 7 year old daughter lost her leg  Denise suffered an eye injury  her husband some hearing loss  Though the Richards aren’t running the Marathon  they are giving the numbers to those who will run on behalf of the Martin W  Richard Charitable Foundation  which they established to honor their son’s message of peace by investing in education  athletics  and community  At the foundation’s recent rally at Fenway Park  McGillivray addressed the group of runners and then spontaneously decided — and announced — that he wanted to join the Richard team by raising money for the charity  “Their goal is to raise $500 000 and they’re almost there already ” he says  “They’re thrilled with that  This is part of the healing process the family needs ” Like many health converts  Dave McGillivray is now preaching the gospel of “staying alive ” as he calls it  “Being fit does not necessarily mean being healthy ” he says  adding that he has dropped red meat  beer  soda  and sugar from his diet and lowered his cholesterol by 70 points  “I’m so excited about running the Marathon this year ” he says  “mainly because it’s the first time in 15 years that I feel I’m in shape  finally ”In January  three months after he learned about his heart problems  McGillivray went to Disney World to speak at the kickoff for the Dopey Challenge  a four race event that starts with a 5K run and ends four days later with a marathon  He was just there to speak  but McGillivray being McGillivray  he decided to do the 5K  The next day  he decided to do the 10K  the next the half marathon  The fourth day  he woke at 2 30 a m  and changed his flight so that he could do the marathon  too “It was the first marathon I’d run since October and I felt great ” he says  This October  a year after his heart disease diagnosis  he hopes to do the Ironman Triathlon in Hawaii  a 2 4 mile ocean swim and 112 mile bike race followed by a marathon  McGillivray has done it eight times — though not for the past 25 years  But first things first  After all of the runners have crossed the finish line on April 21  he and three friends will take to the starting line in Hopkinton  Normally  he starts the course earlier  around 3 p m   but this year  he’ll wait until the race officially closes  at 6 10 p m “At 6 10 02  we’ll be running ” he says  He pauses  “Well  maybe closer to 7 p m ”As always  he’ll wear bib  100 If he has any fear about this year’s Marathon  he doesn’t show it  “I think it’s going to be the safest place on the planet ”', '2014_900')",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
101,,,,,,,,,"('CONCORD  N H  — The New Hampshire Senate rejected a bid to repeal the death penalty when its members deadlocked  12 to 12  Thursday on whether to join the rest of New England in abolishing capital punishment In a 195 year old chamber where rapt senators listened to impassioned appeals from their colleagues  11 Republicans and one Democrat provided the votes needed to table the bill  The split  after weeks of intense lobbying on both sides of the issue  seemed to buttress the state’s reputation as a conservative iconoclast among more liberal neighbors  nSenator Jeb Bradley of Wolfeboro  the Republican majority leader  said it is unlikely the measure would gain the additional vote needed to bring it off the table for another roll call this session “This is what I expected ” Bradley said  “It was obviously a very solemn debate ”The majority leader  who opposed repeal  said he did not impose party discipline on the issue  which he termed a matter of conscience  Two Republicans joined 10 Democrats in the repeal effort The House of Representatives voted overwhelmingly in March to abolish capital punishment in a state where no one has been executed in 75 years and only one person is on death row  a Boston man who fatally shot a Manchester police officer in 2006 Governor Maggie Hassan  a first term Democrat  had said she would sign a bill to join 18 other states that have abolished the death penalty  Connecticut  in 2012  was the fifth New England state to vote for repeal  nPolice Chief Michael Sielicki of Kensington  president of the state association of police chiefs  called the vote a victory for law enforcement “It’s a very personal issue for all of us ” Sielicki said  “I’m glad it remains in effect ”A Democratic sponsor of the House bill  Renny Cushing of Hampton  said he was disappointed in the vote but believes abolition is inevitable “You can see there is real momentum ” said Cushing  whose father was shot and killed at the door of his home in 1988  “Our job is to change one mind at a time ”Cushing said he would work to bring the measure up again in this legislative session  The last day for the Senate to act on House bills is May 15  After that date  a two thirds majority would be required to suspend the Senate rules before the session ends June 5 Despite the even split in the Senate  support for the death penalty runs deep in New Hampshire  In a January poll  capital punishment was supported by 58 percent of respondents and opposed by 28 percent  according to the University of New Hampshire Survey Center The poll found that even when life in prison was offered as an alternative  the death penalty was favored  48 percent to 40 percent Andrew Smith  director of the survey center  said repeal might need Democratic control of the House  Senate  and governor’s office  The missing piece for the Democrats is the Senate  where Republicans hold 13 of 24 seats “I suspect that Republicans in the Senate don’t want to aggravate their GOP base unnecessarily going into the elections this fall  as Republicans are consistently more likely to favor the death penalty than Democrats ” Smith said Senator Bette Lasky  a Nashua Democrat  began the debate by urging her colleagues to end what she called a “barbaric practice ”  n“It is time for New Hampshire to join our five other New England states and every other civilized democracy in the world ” Lasky said “Will our legacy in this chamber today be one of enlightenment and not one of darkness and death ” the senator asked Senator Lou D’Allesandro of Manchester  the only Democrat to oppose repeal  countered that the fate of police Officer Michael Briggs  who was killed  in 2006 while chasing Michael Addison of Dorchester  Mass   compels lawmakers to retain the death penalty Richard Dieter  executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center in Washington  D C   said the lingering effect of the Briggs killing probably was the most influential factor in the vote  “You take away that case  and I think the vote would have been different ” said Dieter  whose group acts as a clearinghouse for data on the death penalty  “It’s a small state  and people remember each vote ”One of the pivotal votes belonged to Senator Russell Prescott  a Republican from Kingston  who had been wavering  “This is the one that gives me peace ” Prescott said afterward about his decision  “I wanted to affirm that our justice system can do its job” and let jurors decide whether a criminal should be executed “There are so many good points on all sides ” Prescott said  “I believe that I have heard all arguments ”Senator David Pierce  a Democrat from Lebanon  said his journey against capital punishment began as a law clerk two decades ago for the Pennsylvania Supreme Court  when he was asked to write an opinion that provided legal justification for an execution “I have regretted that opinion ever since ” Pierce said on the floor  “If we want to honor the victim’s life  we need to do that by ending the cycle of violence  not continuing it ”The death penalty is applicable for a small number of crimes in New Hampshire  including the murder of law enforcement officials while on duty and killings committed during home invasions Before the final vote  Lasky offered an unsuccessful amendment to repeal the death penalty only for murders occurring after July 1  However  Bradley argued that such an amendment — which conceivably would have allowed Addison to be put to death even if the state abolished future executions — probably would be unconstitutional The US chapter of Amnesty International urged lawmakers who had supported repeal to keep working on the issue “If New Hampshire does not end capital punishment  it will only contribute to helping the United States continue to hold its position as one of the top five executioners in the world ” said Steven W  Hawkins  the chapter’s executive director Before the Senate convened  dozens of capital punishment opponents formed a quiet ring around the entrance to the state Capitol  The protesters held signs  one of which read “Not In My Name ” as legislators and

“transportation of firearms” from Florida to Massachusetts  nOscar and Aaron Hernandez are not related The grand jury probe was prompted  in part  by a federal review of three firearms that Massachusetts State Police recovered during an investigation into “a June 17  2013 homicide in North Attleboro ” the indictment said  The only homicide in North Attleborough that day was the early morning shooting of Odin L  Lloyd  27  His body was found in an industrial yard near Aaron Hernandez’s home Aaron Hernandez  24  has pleaded not guilty to in connection with Lloyd’s death and is being held without bail On Thursday  a federal judge in Florida ordered Oscar Hernandez detained until his transfer to Massachusetts to face the indictment  A lawyer who represented him did not respond to inquiries seeking comment The indictment accuses Oscar Hernandez of lying to the Boston grand jury on Dec  4  when he testified that he did not purchase a Toyota Camry last April in Florida or have it shipped to Massachusetts  nState Police investigators in Massachusetts executed a search warrant on the Camry on June 22 at the North Attleborough residence of a man identified only as John Doe  3  and they recovered a rifle from the vehicle  according to the indictment  A law enforcement official briefed on the investigation said that John Doe  3 is Aaron Hernandez Massachusetts troopers

records show  However  the buyers of the pistols are identified in his indictment only as John Doe  1 and John Doe  2 Oscar Hernandez’s testimony in December in Boston about the Camry was relevant “because the grand jury was investigating the interstate transportation of firearms from Florida to Massachusetts in  among other things  the Toyota Camry ” the indictment said Oscar Hernandez is also accused of trying to influence the testimony of a person  identified as KS  who authorities say sold him the Camry that later ended up in Aaron Hernandez’s garage Attorneys for Aaron Hernandez could not be reached for comment Thursday  nThey had previously written in court documents that Oscar Hernandez “may be an important witness” in the murder case and requested notes on statements that he made to investigators in June  n nThe weapon used to kill Lloyd in North Attleborough  which authorities believe was a  45 caliber firearm  has not been recovered The indictment against Oscar Hernandez comes after two associates of Aaron Hernandez  Carlos Ortiz  28  and Ernest Wallace  42  both of Bristol  Conn   were indicted last week on murder charges in Lloyd’s death Prosecutors say the two men and Aaron Hernandez picked Lloyd up at his Dorchester home and drove him to the North Attleborough industrial yard where he was killed  Ortiz and Wallace had previously been charged as accessories after the fact of Lloyd’s murder Ortiz and Wallace’s arraignments on the murder counts have not been set Gerard T  Leone Jr   a former state and federal prosecutor now working in private

102,,,,,,,,,"('The Supreme Judicial Court Wednesday said that because voters decriminalized small amounts of marijuana in 2008  police officers in Massachusetts can no longer rely on the odor of unburnt marijuana to justify searching a person’s car In two unanimous rulings  the state’s highest court said they had already decided in 2011 that the odor of smoked marijuana by itself did not provide police with probable cause to stop people on the street or search the vehicles people are riding in  n t nThe court said in its 2011 ruling that it would be legally inconsistent to allow police to make  warrantless searches after they smell burning marijuana when citizens had decided through a statewide referendum question that law enforcement should “focus their attention elsewhere ’’The court said Wednesday it was now extending the same reasoning to cases where the owner has not yet started smoking it  Marijuana  the court acknowledged  generates a pungent aroma  but an odor by itself does not allow police to determine whether a person has more than an ounce with them  Possession of an ounce or less of marijuana is not a crime “The 2008 initiative decriminalized possession of one ounce or less of marijuana under State law  and accordingly removed police authority to arrest individuals for civil violations ’’ Justice Barbara Lenk wrote for the unanimous court  “We have held that the odor of burnt marijuana alone cannot support probable cause to search a vehicle without a warrant      now  we hold that such odor  of unburnt marijuana   standing alone  does not provide probable cause to search an automobile ’’ nThe court established the new legal standard in the case of Matthew W  Overmyer  who was arrested in Pittsfield by police investigating a car crash  Responding officers noticed what the SJC called “a very strong odor of unburnt marijuana ’’  t nPolice found one bag of marijuana in the glovebox of Overmyer’s car  and a backpack holding even more  leading police to charge him with possession of marijuana with intent to distribute The court said police could not use their noses alone to arrest Overmyer  but might have had another legally approved basis for searching his car  They ordered the case back to the district court for more proceedings  nIn the second ruling  the SJC threw out criminal charges of illegal possession of ammunition and illegal possession of prescription drugs filed against Anthony Craan  Craan was stopped in Dorchester in 2010 by State Police operating a sobriety checkpoint on Gallivan Boulevard A trooper ordered Craan to pull over based on the odor of unburnt marijuana and then found three Ecstasy pills and  38 caliber ammunition after searching Craan’s car  Craan was not arrested at the time  but summonsed into Boston Municipal Court The SJC said police had no legal basis to search Craan’s car and ordered the evidence against him suppressed  The court also rejected the argument from law enforcement that local police can use the odor of  marijuana to stop someone because possession of marijuana is still an offense under federal law “The fact that such conduct is technically subject to a Federal prohibition does not provide an independent justification for a warrantless search ’’ Lenk wrote  n•  n•  n•  n•  n•  n•  n',

Court will allow it to do so ” Hernandez’s three lawyers wrote in a Nov  17 motion  “Thus  the effect of this inflated witness list is to conceal the identities of the witnesses the Commonwealth

going to employee weddings  giving advice  keeping your door open  not talking down  In other words  “stuff our parents taught us ” said Sheinkopf For Mark Novota  managing partner at Wequassett Resort and Golf Club  the Market Basket story reminded him about the importance of creating a strong culture — from the bottom up That’s something the Cape Cod property takes seriously  So seriously that Wequassett turns the concept of the traditional organizational chart on its head  Novota and other executives are seen to occupy the bottom  while the front line workers — housekeepers  waiters

still want to take a bet on us  I consider that a privilege ” said O’Leary  “As soon as you make employees feel that they are lucky to work here  that’s when things go wrong ”For Chambers  the lesson

official languages of the United Nations       and request that it should not be translated ”The only deviation would be with the long form version of the name  Republica de Cabo Verde  which will be Republic of Cabo Verde in English  République de Cabo Verde in French  and so on  “The translation to other official languages of the United Nations shall follow the same pattern ” said the October 2013 missive   There are six official languages used at the UN  The United States received the same request in a November diplomatic note and approved the change in December  officially scrubbing Cape Verde from government databases and websites  Entries for Cabo Verde can now be found in the CIA’s online World Factbook and the State Department’s website But this is about so much more than cumbersome translations  as countries are often called one thing at home and another abroad  Take the Netherlands  known in country as Nederland  or Germany  which is Deutschland at home  This global appeal is about a country’s ability to name itself Political leaders and academics say a country’s name signifies culture  identity  and history  It is a brand that influences everything from economic development to international investment opportunities and tourism  Cabo Verde is on maps  It’s emblazoned on the sides of airplanes  It’s on the cover of trade magazines And geographers say that in an increasingly globalized and technical world  it is crucial there be a standard version of a country’s name for engineering  transportation  and telecommunication systems “When you say United States  people think  powerful  of the economy  the country of invention  of dreams ” Sousa said  “When you talk about Cabo Verde  people think         of sun  the beach  nice people  smiles  working people  but  as of now  something intangible ”He hopes that Cabo Verde will become synonymous with such things as its delicious organic wines made from grapes grown in volcanic soils  nRocky  rugged  and volcanic  Cabo Verde comprises 10 islands whose total landmass is slightly larger than Rhode Island  For more than 500 years  the archipelago that sits about 300 miles off the coast of Senegal was under Portuguese rule  and it was once a key point in the trans Atlantic slave trade It was used as a point of reference — a cape at the edge of the continent — at a time before technology guided sailors from Senegal into the Atlantic Ocean  And that is where the country draws its name “They would say  ‘Look to the islands ’ ” Sousa said  “But really  we are not a cape  We are an archipelago ”It is uncommon for an existing country to change its name in the global community  said Leo Dillon  who heads the Geographical Information Unit in the State Department’s Office of the Geographer a unit responsible for ensuring the boundaries and sovereignty labels on government maps reflect US policy  Dillon also chairs the Foreign Names Committee of the US Board on Geographic Names  which approved Cabo Verde’s request to the United States Dillon said he can think of only three similar requests made in recent memory  the Ivory Coast  which became Cote d’Ivoire  East Timor  which changed its name to Timor Leste upon gaining independence  and Samoa  which used to be Western Samoa “Then  of course ” he said  “there is the Burma Myanmar thing ”Military leaders changed the official name of the Southeast Asian country from Burma to Myanmar in 1989  A new leader was democratically elected a year later but the military cracked down again  barring her from power The US government  and several other English speaking countries  persist in using Burma  The United Nations  however  recognizes the country as Myanmar Dillon said he changed Cape Verde to Cabo Verde in the State Department’s official list of country names as well as in several geographic databases  But  he cautioned  it will take a while for the switch to catch on “You’re going to see Cape Verde in the English news for quite a while ” he said  “In the colloquial sphere  it will be slow to be picked up if it gets picked up at all       just like when we changed from Ivory Coast to Cote d’Ivoire ”News of the name change has yet to penetrate New England’s Cabo Verdean community  even among those who are usually the first to know about developments in their homeland “I didn’t know that ” said Paulo De Barros  director of the Teen Center at St  Peter Church on Bowdoin Street in Dorchester  while tidying up the papers on his desk recently Throughout the center  which serves a large Cabo Verdean population  are reminders of home  There are maps of the 10 islands  the country’s flag  and hand painted  colorful tchotchkes emblazoned with the words “Cape Verde ”De Barros said he found it a bit odd when he arrived in Boston from his homeland in 1991 and discovered that Cabo Verde had become Cape Verde  It was among the many cultural shocks he faced as a new immigrant  Keeping the name the same might help ease the transition for others  he said “For new arrivals  it gives them that pride and identity ” he said  “For Cape Verdean Americans  it might be a struggle to get into the habit ”Joao Rosa  the founding director of Bridgewater State University’s new Institute for Cape Verdean studies  said he is engaged in a lot of work in the island nation but had been unaware that the country asked the world to call it Cabo Verde “There is a particular power from saying  or from stating  this is who we are ” he said  “You’re not being labeled as being this or being that  but you have the capacity to name yourself ”', '2014_504')",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"('Boston police officers disproportionately observed  interrogated  or searched black residents from 2007 to 2010  according to the preliminary results of a study commissioned by the department that were released Wednesday  “This study shows evidence not just of racial disparity  but of racial bias ” said Matthew Segal  legal director of the ACLU of Massachusetts  which collaborated with the Boston Police Department on the genesis of the study  and on Wednesday released its own analysis of the data  “That is really alarming ” t nBut Commissioner William Evans defended the department  and said that officers focused on high crime areas and individuals with gang affiliations and criminal records  He noted that the data were years old  but acknowledged the racial disparity in encounters with Boston police Evans also said the department has since overhauled its procedures for stopping residents and has instituted new racial profiling and bias training  Overall  he said  the report shows the work of a police department focused on violence  not race “We recognize that we’re not perfect ” said Evans  who was appointed commissioner in January  “We’re focusing on the violent areas  we’re focusing on kids who have been involved in gangs and violence  So this is a focused effort  with the whole purpose of making those neighborhoods as safe as possible ”The study looked at 204 739 “Field Interrogation Observation Frisk and or Search” incidents  or “FIOs ” recorded by Boston police from 2007 to 2010  An FIO  said Evans  is done for investigative purposes  and encompasses a range of interactions between police and residents  from an officer driving past a person and writing down his or her location and activities  to an officer stopping a person and talking to or interrogating the person  to an officer frisking or searching an individual  About 40 percent of FIOs led to a frisk or search  and about 24 percent were observational  in which the subject may not even be aware of the encounter with police  the study found While blacks made up 24 4 percent of Boston’s population  according to the 2010 Census  they made up 63 3 percent of FIOs during the period that was examined  The study also found that the biggest predictors for whether a person of any race would be stopped repeatedly were gang affiliation and criminal history  and the biggest predictor for how frequently police conducted FIOs in different neighborhoods was its crime rate  nHowever  after controlling for issues like criminal history  blacks were 8 8 percent more likely than whites to be stopped repeatedly by police  and 12 percent more likely than whites to be frisked or searched during a stop The study also found that black neighborhoods saw more FIOs than white neighborhoods  even after researchers controlled for crime rate  with each 1 percent increase in black residents bringing with it a 2 2 percent hike in FIOs   n“What is the conclusion ” said Anthony Braga  a professor at Harvard University and Rutgers University  who is one of the study’s two lead authors  “One is that  when we analyze the FIO activity of the Boston Police Department  we do find patterns that suggest racial disparities in the way it is being executed in neighborhoods  That said  we also see that the Boston Police Department is using FIOs in ways that you would expect given their crime control mission ”In its analysis  the ACLU stated that of all the FIOs recorded  none led to arrest  and only 2 5 percent led to seizure of contraband But Braga said that interpretation is wrong  FIOs  he said  aren’t necessarily intended to lead to arrest  and the majority do not involve searches  When an FIO does turn up contraband or an arrestable offense  it is no longer considered an FIO  Instead  a police report is filled out in those situations  The results of the study are preliminary  and though the big picture will not change  details might  said Braga  who was the Boston Police Department’s chief policy adviser under former Commissioner Edward F  Davis and currently works with the department on federally and privately funded research projects on crime control The other lead author  Columbia Law School professor Jeffrey Fagan  studied the controversial “stop and frisk” program in New York City  The Boston study raised concerns among community leaders and clergy  though some credited the department with making improvements in recent years  “It angers me that there’s a disproportionate rate of stops of black and Latino men in the city of Boston ” said Councilor Tito Jackson  who was raised in the Grove Hall section of Roxbury  “The data and the numbers indicate that we must do more      and  that we must not selectively enforce in the city of Boston ”Jackson said he expects that councilors will have a chance to meet with Evans and Superintendent in Chief William G  Gross to discuss the report and “determine a course of action to remedy these disparate numbers ”Michael Curry  president of the Boston branch of the NAACP  said he  too  hopes to meet with police and city officials  “What we are saying to the city of Boston is that the few violent offenders do not justify an infringement on the rights of other law abiding citizens of color in the city of Boston ” he said  But the Rev  Mark V  Scott  associate pastor at the Azusa Christian Community in Dorchester who works with at risk youth  took issue with the study in a phone interview  The ACLU said that police engaged in “widespread racially biased street encounters ” but Rev  Scott said that assertion is “not true ’’Scott said that over the last two decades  the police have been moving in the right direction  The study failed to take into account the efforts that police have made on a number of fronts  including helping troubled young people stay in school  he said “Shame  shame on the ACLU ” Scott said  nIn its analysis  the ACLU slammed police for what it called “racially discriminatory policing ” and said that officers have failed to ensure that police civilian encounters comply with constitutional protections against unreasonable searches and seizures  In about 75 percent of the recorded FIOs  officers simply wrote “Investigate person” under their reason for the encounter “This report isn’t about questioning the good faith efforts of police officers to try to reduce violence in the city and to reduce crime in the city ” Segal said  “This was about testing whether those efforts  efforts directed at crime and violence and gangs  account for all these police encounters  And they just don’t ”The ACLU suggested the department require officers to wear body cameras and provide documentation to civilians involved in FIOs  and to publish data on all stops every quarter  Evans said the department will begin reporting data  and he is considering using business cards as receipts  and also will examine using body cameras    Evans also noted  however  that since 2008  the department has decreased the number of FIOs it completes by nearly 42 percent  and has decreased arrests by 33 percent  That decline was accompanied by steady reductions in violent crime  he said  The commissioner also noted the study showed that 5 percent of the individuals subject to FIO accounted for more than 40 percent of the total FIOs conducted  meaning a number of people were involved in multiple encounters An outside expert will review the final study  he said  Former Commissioner Davis  who commissioned the study  said that while it raises valid points  “I think it’s an overreaction to say that this is all racially charged and racially motivated ”Boston Mayor Martin J  Walsh said in a statement that while the report covers a period before his administration  the city has acknowledged and worked to address the racial disparities

is Boston’s most prominent itinerant theater company  making wandering part of its mission and sometimes its aesthetic  nThe company leases office space at the Center for Arts at the Armory in Somerville  and recently expanded its presence there to include a large rehearsal room  But its productions jump around the Boston area  this season hitting stages at the Strand Theatre in Dorchester  the Modern Theatre at Suffolk University downtown  and Pine Manor College in Chestnut Hill  “We feel like we want to represent all the neighborhoods in Boston  We want to touch on everyone ” artistic director Allyn Burrows says  sitting in the new rehearsal space  Now the company wraps up its 10th season with Shakespeare’s comedy “As You Like It ” a tale of persecuted lovers and assumed identities in the Forest of Arden  presented at the former Springstep cultural center in Medford  Their love blocked at court  Rosalind and Orlando flee separately to the forest  and after many reverses and changes of direction  all ends happily Part of the reason Actors’ Shakespeare Project keeps moving is to bring its mix of Shakespeare and playwrights both classic  Chekhov  and contemporary  John Kuntz  to different parts of the Boston area  And part of it is financial and organizational  says Burrows  who was with Shakespeare   Company for years and saw it struggle as it moved from The Mount in Lenox to its own campus in that town “Once you take up permanent residence on a piece of real estate  a lot of your resources and a lot of your energies are going to go to maintaining that ” Burrows says  “We like to go into a community and form relationships in the schools  work with the kids  work with those neighborhoods  do lots of outreach  and then plan on coming back ” nUsing a new venue for a show has an artistic impact as well “The director has got to walk in and say  ‘How does this room speak to this play ’ Because that’s our ace in the hole  That’s what makes up for the fact that at the beginning of the year  we’re like  ‘Where are we going to go now ’ u2009” The contemporary architecture of the former Springstep cultural center is a great example  Burrows says  “It’s wild  it’s almost out of ‘War of the Worlds ’ like a big spaceship landed in the middle of Medford Square ” he says  “Even the doors are shaped like portals  you know ”“It informs the show ” director Robert Walsh agrees  “It can’t not  because it’s such an environment  A real dedication to a period appropriate clothing look is going to feel really bizarre in that room ” That inspired a turn to steampunk in costume design for the formal culture of the Duke’s court  he says Another challenge is finding new avenues for exploration in what is one of Shakespeare’s best known plays  Walsh is looking forward to delving into the transformation that occurs when the fleeing Rosalind disguises herself as the young man Ganymede  “If you read the play  that happens offstage  and for me I’m much more interested to bring it onstage and see what that’s like  What’s that cost her ” Walsh says The task of showing us falls to company member Brooke Hardman  who plays Rosalind opposite Jesse Hinson as Orlando  She says she’s working her way into the role by finding the character’s physical presence “I’ve had a lot of fun trying to let Rosalind discover how to be Ganymede onstage ” Hardman says  “It’s not like I know right off the bat how to be a guy  There are some moments we’re playing with where I’m finding out how far I can go and where my voice is and where my stride is and how I stand “And it only gets more complicated when I’m with Orlando  because there are points when I definitely forget I’m pretending to be somebody else ” she says Costuming helps  “I’m wearing a corset for the first act  which any actress or any woman who has ever worn a corset will tell you  it does something very specific to your body and the way you breathe and the way you move  It’s very constricted ” she says  “And with the taking off of the corset and going into Arden  you can breathe  you can think  you can say what you want  you can be anyone you want to be ”The other challenge  she says  is that about 80 u2009percent of her lines are prose  not the usual iambic pentameter  “I’m realizing how much as a Shakespearean actor I depend on that meter to look for clues Shakespeare has left as to what’s going on with the character ” Hardman says  “She’s got a lot to say  and she says it very quickly  and it’s easier  to learn  when it’s iambic pentameter  Usually the memorization is not one of the parts of the process I get too worried about but this go round has been a very unique challenge ”Burrows lives close by the Springstep building  as do the married actors Paula Plum  who plays Touchstone  and Richard Snee  who plays Corin   Built in 2002  Springstep served as a nonprofit cultural center featuring dance and other arts before closing its doors last year  In the fall  the building was purchased by John Walsh  chief executive officer of the Medford based Elizabeth Grady skin care company  Reached by phone this week  Walsh declined to discuss the future of the building  The venue inside has been configured to seat 150  far fewer than other theaters the company has played  including the nearly 350 seats it used at the Chevalier Theatre just a few blocks away  After presenting “Macbeth” at the Chevalier in 2012  Burrows says  some patrons complained it was too big  the actors too far away “One of the things our audience really responds to is the immediacy of our storytelling as embodied by the actors in the room ” Burrows says  “People like to be close to the actors with us  we’ve found  It’s kind of our hedge against technology — proximity ”',

Hernandez is accused of murdering Daniel Abreu and Safiro Furtado  The two men were shot to death while stopped at a traffic light on July 16  2012  by someone who drove up alongside them in an SUV with Rhode Island plates and opened fire  nThe new charges raise the disturbing possibility that Hernandez played NFL games during the 2012 2013 season after murdering two men  Hernandez now faces charges in three murders  He was already facing a first degree murder charge in the June 2013 slaying of Odin L  Lloyd of Boston in North Attleborough  Conley had no comment on whether there was a connection between the double slaying in Boston and the slaying in North Atleborough Conley said that after a “chance encounter” between Hernandez  Abreu  and Furtado at a Boston nightclub  Hernandez trailed the men in his car  Hernandez then allegedly pulled his car up to theirs  firing a  38 caliber Smith   Wesson pistol “multiple times” into the car  killing Abreu and Furtado  and injuring a third man Conley said investigators had been able to recover the murder weapon and the car Hernandez was driving  “For us  this case was never about Aaron Hernandez  This case was about two victims  who were stalked  ambushed  and senselessly murdered on the streets of the city they called home ” said Conley  n“This was a chance encounter where two young men were out     and basically had an encounter that led to their deaths ” said Police Commissioner William Evans  “I remember going to the scene that morning      It was a terrible tragedy ”Conley said no more information would be available about the “texture and detail” of the encounter at the nightclub until he is arraigned  Conley’s office said that would happen next week at the earliest Conley said media reports had originally suggested that Abreu and Furtado were tied to a Cape Verdean gang based in Dorchester  He said the characterization was “unfair to their families and to their memories ”“Neither of them were involved in gangs  guns  or violent crime of any kind ” he said The grand jury has also indicted Hernandez’s cousin  Tanya Singleton  on a criminal contempt charge for refusing to testify to the grand jury about the SUV after being granted immunity  Conley said today William T  Kennedy  who represents the Abreu and Furtado families  said that the families were overwhelmed by the news  but also determined to let the Boston community know that the people they lost to gun violence were good men wrongly cut down too early in their life “The family would want people to know that Danny and Safiro were just two very good guys who were just trying to make their way in this world ’’ said Kennedy  “These are just a couple of hard working guys who had dreams like any other  They worked together cleaning toilets at the Quincy YMCA ’’On the night of the murders  Kennedy said  “They went out with a couple of other fellas and went to the club  danced with a couple of pretty girls  had a

the first degree murder trial of former New England Patriot Aaron Hernandez  a judge ruled Friday  dealing a blow to prosecutors  They had argued that those texts would have shown Lloyd knew he was about to die — and who was going to kill him  t nProsecutors tried in vain to persuade Superior Court Judge E  Susan Garsh to admit the text messages from June 2013 as evidence  as well as their theory that Hernandez killed Lloyd because he worried that Lloyd knew too much about another crime Hernandez is charged with — a 2012 double murder in Boston But Garsh said the texts did not suggest Lloyd feared for his life and that prosecutors had no credible basis for linking his killing with the fatal shootings of two men in Boston a year earlier “It is clearly in the realm of speculation ” Garsh said at the Fall River Justice Center  where jury selection is to begin Jan  9 in the trial of Hernandez  24 The mother of Lloyd  a 27 year old semi pro football player from Dorchester  ran out of the courtroom weeping after Garsh ruled the text messages should be withheld Minutes before he was shot in the early morning hours of June 17  2013  Lloyd texted his sister  “U saw who I was with     NFL     Just so U know ”The timing of those texts  sent at the same time Hernandez and Lloyd were in a car pulling into the industrial park where Lloyd was shot to death  reveal a frightened man trying to warn his sister  Bristol Assistant District Attorney William McCauley argued But Garsh questioned whether the texts could just as easily have been Lloyd bragging about his friendship with Hernandez  Lloyd’s sister responded to one of the texts  “LOL ” or laughing out loud Garsh rejected the prosecution’s argument that Lloyd’s text was a “dying declaration ” nProsecutors “do not provide a basis to infer that he was under the belief of imminent death ” she said While the prosecution’s case has been weakened  the extent won’t be known until the trial  legal observers said “It’s a good day for the defense ” said Michael Doolin  a former Suffolk prosecutor who is now a Boston defense attorney and is not associated with the case  “The defense seems to have won a victory  It narrows the scope of what the government can present ”Bristol prosecutors will still be able to present surveillance footage of Hernandez at his North Attleborough home holding a gun the night Lloyd was killed  They said they also have footage of the car Hernandez was driving leaving the industrial park where Lloyd was shot  then returning to Hernandez’s home minutes after the killing The  45 caliber handgun that was used to kill Lloyd has never been recovered  but state troopers found a  22 caliber firearm in the woods near the scene of the crime that prosecutors said was discarded by one of Hernandez’s associates  Prosecutors have filed motions saying they want to test DNA found in the car  biological material from Lloyd’s hand  and the  22 caliber gun Garsh allowed the discovered gun into evidence  but agreed with defense attorneys that other weapons connected to Hernandez  including a rifle  should not be admitted because they have no direct bearing on the case When McCauley tried to argue that a 2009 photo of Hernandez holding what appeared to be a  45 caliber gun posted on the celebrity gossip site TMZ should be allowed into evidence  Garsh mildly rebuked him “It’s just a piling on with respect to evidence of gun” possession  Garsh said  Alexander Bradley  a former friend who has accused Hernandez of shooting him in the face a few months before Lloyd was killed  is expected to testify against him  Bradley allegedly saw a gun that resembled a  45 caliber in Hernandez’s possession But Garsh said prosecutors cannot ask Bradley about his claim that Hernandez shot him in the face following an argument after they left a club in Florida  McCauley had argued that the shooting was similar to the shooting of Lloyd and the two men in Boston in 2012 — Lloyd was shot a night after he and Hernandez hung out at a club in Boston  The two Boston victims  Safiro Furtado  28  and Daniel Abreu  29  were shot after one of them accidentally bumped into Hernandez at a club in the Theatre District  causing him to spill his drink  Suffolk prosecutors have said  Furtado and Abreu did not know Hernandez  who has pleaded not guilty in their killings “We’re talking about three people getting killed and a fourth getting shot in 11 months ” McCauley said  “I don’t think it’s fair to say these things aren’t relevant ”McCauley argued that a text from Hernandez to his fiancée the night he hung out with Lloyd showed he was worried about what his friend knew — he had shown Lloyd the “other spot ” meaning the club where he encountered the two men in the Suffolk case  the prosecutor said Lloyd knew too much  McCauley said “This is just a fantasy ” retorted James Sultan  one of Hernandez’s lawyers Garsh agreed that the connections prosecutors were trying to make were tenuous and could be prejudicial to a jury Garsh’s rulings may have stripped the prosecutors of being able to offer the jury a powerful motive for Lloyd’s killing  said Doolin  the Boston lawyer “Jurors expect some sort of motive  some reason why this happened  and if the government doesn’t have a clear motive  it certainly weakens the case ” Doolin said  “It’s not legally necessary for the government to present motive  but it’s certainly something the jury looks for ” n', '2014_624')",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

tempering  and then the rich mouthfeel of melting chocolate  You may detect berry  raisin  coffee  citrus  or smoky notes  and the bar gives you great pleasure In New England  there are many chocolate makers  We found 14 who are crafting great bars  Seven are bean to bar producers  who import beans and then roast  crack  winnow  grind  conch  temper  and mold their bars  The others purchase processed chocolate  or cocoa  to create their own particular blends  Sugar sweetens most bars  but two local companies use honey  t nChocolate is a matter of personal taste  and everyone who loves it has an opinion  A few years ago  the trend was the darker the better  and many thought that a higher percentage marked on the bar — say  60 percent — meant you were getting a top quality product  A high percentage bar means most of the chocolate is made from cocoa solids  anything derived from the cocoa bean   the rest is mostly sugar  L A  Burdick Chocolate’s head chocolatier  Michael Klug  says  “It’s nonsense to always say high percentage chocolate is better ” If it’s an inferior bean  having 80 percent of it is worse than 60 percent  he says Master chocolatier Richard Tango Lowy  owner of Dancing Lion Chocolate in Manchester  N H   explains  “The flavor profile has little to do with the percentage  I can show you a 100 percent that is delicate and mild with no edge  and a 66 percent that will bowl you over ”Today  much of the focus is on controlling the whole process from bean to bar  using cacao  cocoa beans  from one region to craft single origin chocolate  and buying cacao directly from the growers  Many chocolate makers pay above Fair Trade prices to ensure a sustainable livelihood for the farmers  Taza Chocolate of Somerville  one of the first bean to bar companies in the US  is an industry leader in the commitment to ethical cacao sourcing  Founders Alex Whitmore and his wife  Kathleen Fulton  also reintroduced the centuries old style of Mexican stone ground chocolate  The decision to produce a “rustic  gritty chocolate ” says Whitmore  was intended “to make people stop and think about what they’re eating ” To that end  not all consumers like his product  “We’re not for everyone ” he says  Newer bean to bar companies in Massachusetts include Rogue Chocolatier in Three Rivers  Chequessett Chocolate in North Truro  and Somerville Chocolate in Somerville  Rogue’s Colin Gasko specializes in single origin  two ingredient chocolates  just cocoa beans and cane sugar  Other bars usually contain vanilla  additional cocoa butter  lecithin  an emulsifier   and flavorings  He takes a purist’s view and doesn’t add inclusions  the term for add ins  such as nuts  dried fruit  and cocoa nibs   “I’m trying to highlight the nuances of cacao ” he says  “It’s a wasted effort to make really great chocolate and then throw some nuts on it ” Another two ingredient chocolate maker is Eric Parkes  founder of Somerville Chocolate  The former architect started a chocolate CSA in 2012 as “a novel way” to fund his production  CSA members get three bars  reflecting different cacao or slight variations in bean roasts  about every two months   In Vermont  Andy Jackson of Middlebury Chocolates went so far as to build his own wood fired roaster  this led to his new Epoch line  He roasts cacao over fruitwood  ages the beans in cocoa ash  and then slowly refines the chocolate at lower than normal temperatures to reduce any bitterness  “It’s a long and elaborate process ” says Jackson  but one that yields clean crisp  mellow  dark chocolate without any harshness Also in the Green Mountain State is the three year old bean to bar Blue Bandana Chocolate Maker  spearheaded by Eric Lampman  son of the founder of 31 year old Lake Champlain Chocolates  “It’s a new dimension for us ” says Lampman The remaining chocolatiers on our list buy blocks of couverture chocolate  it contains a bit more cocoa butter for smoothness and a glossy finish  or cocoa mass or powder  often from large producers such as Barry Callebaut  El Ray  and Valrhona  The crafting skills here lie in melting  blending  tempering  and molding  With the bean to bar movement growing  Klug of Burdick’s  which imports couvertures  weighs in  “Not all bean to bar is good  It’s like your neighbor making his own beer ”For some chocolatiers  the bar is an art form  Ellen Byrne  cofounder with her husband  Christopher Carlson  of Byrne   Carlson in Portsmouth  N H   has a background in fine arts  “It’s the taste and quality of the chocolate and the visual ” she says  Former physicist Tango Lowy of Dancing Lion uses unique molds and tinted cocoa butter as paint  “You eat with your eyes first ” he says  Honey replaces sugar in chocolates made by Apotheker’s of Dorchester and Pure7 Chocolate of Carlisle  “We were trying to clean up our diet ” says Shari Apotheker  “But we wanted it to still be a fancy chocolate and feel indulgent ” Such chocolate won’t be to everyone’s taste — it has a distinct honey flavor and softer  moister texture Chocolates are “gastronomic complexities ” says Klug  Burdick’s chocolate maker  When tasting chocolate  he adds  “Try a lot of

dawn Friday on Irish soil and paid homage to Shannon Airport  the point of departure to Boston for scores of immigrants  including his parents  and the setting of a poignant speech by President John F  Kennedy After touching down here in a driving rain  Walsh was greeted by his mother  dozens of relatives  10 mayors from across Ireland  and a throng of local reporters  t n“Shannon is a place where the relationship between Ireland and America has taken flight ” Walsh said at a press conference  “Today we stand at the same trans Atlantic gateway that brought my parents to America and brought American presidents to Ireland ”The Irish greeted Kennedy like a beloved king when he visited in 1963  mobbing the presidential motorcade as it wound through narrow streets  The trip culminated at Shannon Airport    “I am going to come back and see old Shannon’s face again ” Kennedy was assassinated five months later “We know that he never returned ” Walsh said Friday  “But we can take heart from the president’s final words  when he told the gathered crowd  ‘I am taking  as I go back to America  all of you with me ’ In an important way  that is exactly what he did  His time in Ireland changed the Irish American relationship permanently ”For Walsh  it marked his first visit to Ireland since he was elected mayor  The trip also represents the first trade mission by a Boston mayor in 16 years  he said During his 11 day tour of the island  Walsh said  he will discuss opportunities in life science in Galway and visit start up incubators in Londonderry and Donegal  He said he will forge stronger ties between Boston and Belfast and meet with business leaders in Dublin  where Massachusetts companies have flourished As he spoke to reporters early Friday at the airport  Walsh acknowledged that his first trip as mayor was a personal milestone  He spent summers in Ireland as a child  visiting family in the rural Connemara villages his parents left a few years before Kennedy’s momentous visit  Like the president  Walsh’s parents flew out of Shannon “My family’s American journey started more than 50 years ago right here in this very spot when my parents departed for Boston ” Walsh said  “Back then  the flight took about 13 hours to go across the Atlantic  Shannon was their gateway from the West of Ireland to Boston  and for so many other people Shannon has been the gateway from the West of Ireland to all of America ”While Walsh spoke  his mother  Mary  sat in the front row beaming  She was awash in memories of leaving home at age 17  She thought about her late husband  and it made her lonely  she said  but she looked up at her son behind the podium and felt great joy “It’s very emotional  very emotional  the whole thing ” Mary Walsh said  “I’m very proud ”During his trip  Kennedy touched on the same theme  and in a way foretold the story of Walsh and his family Kennedy spoke June 29  1963  at Eyre Square in Galway  the largest city in the county where Walsh’s parents grew up “If the day was clear enough  and if you went down to the bay and you looked west  and your sight was good enough  you would see Boston  Massachusetts ” Kennedy said    “And if you did  you would see down working on the docks there some Doughertys and Flahertys and Ryans and cousins of yours who have gone to Boston and made good ”Walsh made good  He is the son of a union laborer who followed his father into construction  He rose through the ranks of organized labor and served 16 years in the Legislature before becoming Boston’s first new mayor in 20 years The purpose of his trip was to build on the country’s historic bond with Boston  Walsh said  He noted that Irish companies have planted roots in Boston  including Primark  which will be the anchor tenant of the development of the former Filene’s Building in Downtown Crossing  Boston companies such as Liberty Mutual are also thriving in Ireland  Walsh said “Ireland is a different place now than when my parents left ” he said  “Young Irish people coming to Boston today are as likely to possess programming and marketing skills as they are strong hands and a willing heart ”When Walsh took questions  an Irish reporter fired off a lengthy inquiry in Gaelic  the native Irish language  Walsh listened intently and responded briefly in Gaelic “For the American reporters ” Walsh said with a smile  “the question is about immigration  undocumented immigrants  and particularly the Irish community ”Walsh’s parents spoke Gaelic at their home on Taft Street in Dorchester  His skill with the language impressed even the Irish “I can tell you 50 percent of the audience couldn’t understand that question ” said Mayor Alan Coleman of County Cork  “And he answered it ”Some in the crowd saw echoes of Kennedy “Could you see him in the White House ” asked Noel Grealish  a member of the Irish parliament  “He sounded like Kennedy and certainly looked the part ”', '2014_845')",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

evidence from the athlete’s cellphone In a 22 page ruling  Judge E  Susan Garsh wrote that Hernandez’s lawyers voluntarily turned over the phone to State Police on the evening of June 18  2013  one day after the killing of Odin Lloyd  27  of Dorchester  t nHernandez  24  and two co defendants  Carlos Ortiz  28  and Ernest Wallace  42  have pleaded not guilty to murder charges in the slaying of Lloyd  whose bullet riddled body was found in an industrial yard near Hernandez’s North Attleborough home According to court records  Hernandez’s lawyers argued that State Police obtained the phone from one of his lawyers at the Boston office of Ropes   Gray under a “false claim of legal authority ” which Garsh rejected A warrant had authorized State Police to seize the phone from Hernandez  but when troopers searched his house on June 18  the device was at his lawyers’ office  records show   nPatrick Bomberg  a Bristol County prosecutor  informed Hernandez’s defense team that officials had a warrant for their client’s phone “At no point during this conversation did Bomberg  explicitly or implicitly  claim authority under the warrant to send a state trooper to the offices of Ropes   Gray to seize the phone or indicate that the State Police were on the way to Ropes   Gray to seize the phone under the authority of the warrant ” Garsh wrote One of Hernandez’s lawyers  Robert Jones  later handed over the phone to a trooper “The turning over of the phone was a voluntary act ” Garsh wrote  “It was not the result of force  threat  trickery  duress  or coercion ”The ruling is significant in part because Hernandez allegedly texted Lloyd in the hours before the killing  including one message where he arranged to pick up Lloyd at his Dorchester residence “I’m coming to grab that tonight ” Hernandez texted  according to court records  “u gon b around I need dat and we could step for a little again ”Prosecutors have also said that Hernandez summoned Wallace and Ortiz to Massachusetts from Connecticut via text message in the hours before the murder A spokesman for District Attorney C  Samuel Sutter declined to comment on Garsh’s ruling  citing a gag order  A lawyer for Hernandez did not return a call seeking comment In a related ruling  Garsh also allowed other evidence seized from Hernandez’s home  including a square shaped bowl that authorities believed contained marijuana residue and a scale next to the dish  Garsh  however  ruled out using a white towel found at the house as evidence Prosecutors had said the towel appeared similar to one observed in service station surveillance camera images of the occupants of Hernandez’s vehicle around the time of the killing and appeared similar to a towel found at the murder scene Also Friday  Garsh rejected a motion from

u2009” Walsh recalls  “I’ve sat next to him for 20 years ”A day shadowing Walsh makes this much plain  The job is all consuming  there’s no time for the inconsequential  or for idle thoughts It’s 8 a

Boston Herald with the headline  “Walsh’s first crisis  Spike in fatal violence  9 slayings  19 days ” nHe arrives at City Hall at 8 23 a m  His police driver unlocks a private entrance  He has his own elevator that whisks him up to his fifth floor office  He throws his overcoat on a chair — he still hasn’t found a place to hang it up — and unwraps a piece of gum  which he throws in his mouth  His jaw flexes as he begins to chew Walsh sits behind the desk — something Menino almost never did — and fiddles with a pack of Post it notes  The middle desk drawer is antiseptically neat  with everything in its place  paper clips  pens  a toothbrush with a protective cover over the bristles  One of his top aides  Joseph Rull  appears in the doorway “What’s up ” Walsh asks “It’s busy ” Rull says   nWalsh walks to the office next door for an 8 30 a m  staff meeting  He hasn’t fully adjusted to  the idea that when he wants to meet  people will come to him  Does he want to be that kind of mayor  Still sorting it out Seven people crowd an oval table  which holds cups of coffee and three laptops  The roster includes Rull  the mayor’s press people  his attorney and adviser Elissa Flynn Poppey  and his chief of staff  Daniel Arrigg Koh  Policy chief Joyce Linehan is there  too  pecking at a laptop festooned with two blue bumper stickers that declare  “Don’t blame me — I’m from Massachusetts ”They are reading headlines  talking about the spate of deadly shootings  parsing out the day ahead  The conversation zips through a host of topics  an announcement of a grant to combat asthma  an update on reports from his transition team  a discussion about an upcoming monthly radio feature called “ask the mayor ” He is attending the governor’s State of the Commonwealth speech But mostly  they talk about the violence Walsh leans forward  elbows on knees  jaw pulsing as he chews his gum  He is frustrated because the media are demanding a press conference  He has begun taking steps to tamp down the violence  he says  He wants to treat neighborhood trauma and get at root causes  But he says no to the press conference  They just want a sound bite  The insatiable hunger of the press is an adjustment On this night  he is speaking at a graduation for Year Up  a job training program that places urban youth in corporate apprenticeships  TV reporters will be there  looking for a comment on the violence  Walsh wants the media to cover the graduation  Highlight what’s being done to break the cycle  he says  Not just the violence “This isn’t like a snowstorm where we can go out and shovel ” Walsh says  “This is a long term problem that’s been going on for generations in American cities ”  nWalsh throws his gum in the garbage and unwraps a fresh piece  The 46 year old former labor leader is sturdy but trim with a wide  sometimes goofy smile  He plasters his reddish hair neatly in place with gel and has a skin colored mole high on his left cheek  On this day  he wears a gray suit with subtle blue pinstripes  powder blue tie  and a white shirt  The anteroom immediately outside the mayor’s office is a hectic crossroads  There are three doors  Two receptionists regulate the flow  knocking on the mayor’s door to keep meetings moving  A coffee table has an Irish America magazine  Walsh’s face is on the cover with the headline  “A hero for the working man ” nA young aide enters the anteroom with a puzzled look  “Do you know where Joyce is ” he asks  pointing at two of the doors  “I think she’s in one of these rooms ”Walsh is on his sixth meeting  running 15 minutes late  He listens to a labor negotiations update  He’s sitting at the head of a 10 foot mahogany table  occupying the perch where Menino always sat Floor to ceiling windows offer a postcard perfect view of Boston  the red bricks and grasshopper weather vane of Faneuil Hall  curving narrow streets  and the bright blue sparkling water of Boston Harbor  A police siren wails in the distance  Walsh is learning to distinguish between police and fire sirens  He thinks about where they are going  whether he’ll get a call  He has different worries now Walsh looks back at the table  For the moment  he must focus on the contract update “It would be nice to get this done ” he says   nIt’s afternoon and Walsh is sticking his hand up a fireplace in Parkman House  the city owned Greek Revival mansion on Beacon Hill  He is feeling for ashes  checking to see whether the fireplace is still used  He possesses a child like enthusiasm  Ask the right question  and Walsh will take you into the basement of his Dorchester condo to see his sports memorabilia  Or he’ll stick his hand up a fireplace at Parkman House The mansion is extraordinary  original portraits and Chinese porcelain  14 foot ceilings  an elevator  and a dining room capable of hosting 60 for supper  Walsh says his roughly 800 square foot condo in Savin Hill could fit in the mansion’s second floor parlor He is here hosting an informal meeting of local mayors  He wants to work together and not fight over resources and companies and people  Walsh is sitting in a leather chair  drinking coffee with milk and sugar  talking with Mayor Alex B  Morse of Holyoke  Other mayors chitchat Walsh is in the center of the room  but he isn’t the focal point  Not yet  He wants to start the meeting  but he can’t quiet the chatter  He looks to Everett Mayor Carlo DeMaria for help “Can you whistle ” Walsh asks But DeMaria can’t hear him  Walsh raises his voice a little louder  The chatter subsides  He leads a discussion  He still sounds like a state representative  referring to people’s “districts” or “areas ” These are mayors  They control cities and towns  No matter the words  his tone stresses cooperation  “I believe in strength in numbers ” Walsh says   nThe phone rings in the car  This is one of those calls  a parent looking for help with a son struggling with addiction  Walsh is a recovering alcoholic  sober now for almost 20 years  He’s long been a leader in the recovery community  taking phone calls at all hours  helping people get help  As mayor  he won’t give up his old cellphone  Too many people need the number  “Where’s the kid  Mass  General ” Walsh asks  “Was he doing heroin  Or was it more than that ” nA crowded union hall heaves with excited hotel workers  Walsh’s campaign anthem blares  “I’m Shipping Up to Boston ” driven by accordion  banjo  and guitar  He enters like a hero  The crowd roars  clapping and raising their arms  Cellphone cameras flash “Mayor Marty Walsh  It feels good to say that  doesn’t it ” shouts Local 26 president Brian Lang  “Immigrant parents  Worked with his hands  Built his union  Lives in our neighborhoods  Shares our dreams  Marty is us ”Walsh is here to say thank you for the election  The endorsement of Local 26 was a turning point  The union is a liberal force composed largely of people of color  The endorsement helped him grow beyond his base in Dorchester and South Boston  And it validated his progressive bona fides Walsh delivers a stump speech  ticking off his biography  But he has a different ending  On election night  he slept at the Boston Park Plaza hotel  He ordered room service  A member of Local 26 delivered the food  he says  He points to her in the union hall crowd  She left the trays in the hall  he says  and ran in the hotel room to give him a hug  “She said basically  ‘I just got elected mayor of the city of Boston ’ u2009” Walsh says  “I want to thank you for that  That’s when it really started to sink in that we won ”  nThe media find Walsh backstage at John Hancock Hall in Back Bay  before the Year Up graduation  He is patient when a cameraman’s microphone malfunctions  They ask about the spike in killings  He says there is work to be done  that nine dead is nine too many  Police have seized 20 guns this year  But policing alone will not solve violence  he says  The city needs to increase opportunities and programs for young people  Programs such as the corporate apprenticeships at Year Up Moment later  he’s on stage  addressing an audience of about 1 000    He reads from notes and stumbles over statistics  His numbers are wrong  he says  The audience laughs “I don’t know what I was thinking when I wrote this speech  I’m getting rid of the notes ” Walsh says  looking up  “I know what Year Up does  Let me just say this  When the news media talks about what’s going on in the city of Boston and they talk about violence  they don’t talk about Year Up graduates ”He goes into stump speech mode again  This time  he highlights his adversity  He talks about childhood cancer and struggling in school  A nun liked him so much in fifth grade  she kept him there an extra year  The audience laughs  He goes into detail about his drinking  blacking out  recovery  second chances  When he ran for mayor  he says  he never had a doubt he was going to win “The reason I tell you this story isn’t because I’m bragging ” Walsh says  “It’s because when I look out at the graduates  I’m looking in a mirror ” nBackstage  Walsh is walking fast  almost running  He has less than 20 minutes to make it to the State House for the governor’s speech  He tosses a piece of gum in his mouth  A man wants a photograph  He stops and then is off again and in the car The Tahoe makes good time  Lights and sirens are not necessary  This is Walsh’s first time back to the State House since resigning his seat  But mementoes of his time there are never far away  Even his cellphone reminds him  The screen saver on one of the phones shows his name in lights on the House board that captures roll call  Inside the State House  Walsh tosses his gum in the garbage  He steps onto a red carpet and shakes the governor’s hand  Then he’s in his seat  in the front row After the speech  Walsh is circled by seven reporters  He thrusts his hands in his pockets and takes questions  property taxes  revenue estimates  the retirement system  and more about the recent run of violence “Anything else ” he asks   nThe mayor’s office is dark  Walsh gropes a wall  quickly finding the light switch  He is looking for the text of a speech he is giving at 8 the next morning  less than 12 hours away The mayor is hungry and talking to his aides about ordering a pineapple  ham  and onion pizza from a joint on Savin Hill Avenue  The best Hawaiian pizza in town  he says  There are no takers  He orders a salad and chicken fingers  He is down the elevator  back in the car  and bound for Dorchester “There’s still a lot of work to do before I get settled in the job  A lot of it now is reacting because I’m new ” Walsh says  “We haven’t had the time to implement the policies we talked about during the campaign  We’re still in the setup phase ”At Venice Pizza  the woman behind the counter smiles  She hands him his food but doesn’t recognize him as mayor  Walsh is home at 9 p m  A patrol car is parked at the curb  Inside the house  he turns on the light  The Tahoe drives away Walsh sets down his keys and flips through his mail  He clicks on the television and flips to the State of the Union speech  He says he is going to slip into his New England Patriots sweat pants  sink into the couch  eat the chicken fingers and salad  and watch the president  “Today was a busy day  I’m a little tired ” Walsh says  “Another day in the life ”', '2014_646')",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bristol  Conn   on the charge   nSingleton also faces an accessory charge in the slaying of Odin L  Lloyd  27  of Dorchester  whose bullet riddled body was found in an industrial park near Hernandez’s North Attleborough home last June  Hernandez  24  has to murder and weapons charges in Lloyd’s murder and is being held without bail  nSingleton’s lawyer  E  Peter Parker  argued unsuccessfully Friday to combine the contempt and accessory cases into a single trial  in part because the allegations are related and separate proceedings would be prejudicial to his client But Garsh rejected the bid  “I do find that these offenses are not related offenses ” she said  “And that as unrelated offenses  joinder is not in the best interest of justice ”Prosecutors say that Singleton helped Ernest Wallace  a Hernandez associate charged as an accessory after the slaying  travel to Florida after the killing  In addition  prosecutors say she discussed helping Carlos Ortiz  who also faces an accessory after the murder charge  flee to Puerto Rico  Ortiz and Wallace were with Hernandez in the vehicle that took Lloyd to the scene during the early morning hours when he was killed  according to authorities Singleton is charged with contempt after she allegedly refused to testify before a Bristol County trial after being granted immunity to do so Prosecutor William McCauley said Friday that the contempt and accessory allegations against Singleton are unrelated and should not be addressed in one trial  Garsh indicated that she may consider pushing the contempt trial back  if necessary  due to Singleton’s health issues Parker said Singleton  who is free on bail and being treated for breast cancer  has made four  emergency visits to the hospital in recent weeks after adverse reactions to chemotherapy Separately on Friday  prosecutors filed a document  called a bill of particulars  laying out how    Ortiz allegedly helped Hernandez after the murder  Ortiz helped Hernandez and Wallace

explosion ” said Mike Dennehy  Boston’s interim commissioner for public works  “We’re keeping up as best we can  but a lot of them are recurring ”This winter’s lower than average temperatures  coupled with higher than average snowfall  have created the perfect climate to spawn a barrage of teeth clattering  bone jarring  axle cracking potholes across the region  And public works agencies are struggling to keep up In Boston  the numbers are stunning  In January in 2012 and again in 2013  Dennehy said  his agency filled about 800 potholes  This January  they have filled about 3 200  In February  they have dealt with another 1 700  nEven the city’s secret weapon against potholes has had enough with the unrelenting pace of battle    a city owned truck that keeps hot pavement filler from hardening on the way to pothole repair sites — “that’s our MVP ” Dennehy said — broke down earlier this week and may be out of commission until Monday Highways around the state have not escaped the problem  The Massachusetts Department of Transportation  which began counting pothole repairs this year  patched 782 potholes in January  More than 160 more have been reported in February  though the agency has not been able to fix them all  They are waiting for days of not so bad weather  and so far  those have been hard to come by “We have been in what seems like constant snow and ice operations  and pothole patching requires fairly good weather ” said Sara Lavoie  MassDOT spokeswoman Nor have the suburbs been immune  In Newton  for example  the average number of pothole repair requests to the city’s 311 system in January of the previous three years was 55  Last month  by contrast  the system fielded a whopping 361 complaints “That’s my life ” said David Turocy  Newton’s public works commissioner  “And that’s only a fraction of what’s out there ”Blame it on the polar vortex The cycle of freezing conditions  followed by a thaw  allow water to seep into small cracks in the pavement and expand  causing the asphalt to buckle beneath the weight of passing cars  Freeze thaw cycles do not get much more dramatic than they did in early January  when temperatures soared from 1 degree to 56 degrees in a 48 hour period and then dropped back down to 7 degrees “It’s the perfect recipe for a pothole ” Dennehy said That whiplash of highs and lows set the scene for a record breaking season of epic pavement craters  Boston residents are not ones to suffer in silence  The mayor’s office has been flooded with requests for pothole repairs via its 24 hour hot line  617 635 4500  and its  spothole Twitter hashtag  as well as the city’s smartphone app for reporting neighborhood issues   “Huuuuuuge pothole ” reported one person  in downtown Boston  Another pointed out a “monster pothole” in the Fenway “Large pothole middle of the road  Fills with murky water to fool unsuspecting pedestrians of its ankle twisting depth ”  of a crater on Bowdoin Avenue in Dorchester  n“The street is trying to destroy my car   ” came   “Please help    ” nThe scourge of potholes has blanketed Boston’s neighborhoods evenly  Dennehy said  Each of the city’s work teams are scheduled to make about 10 pothole repair stops per shift  But efforts to plow through their jam packed punch list are often waylaid by more potholes “They go out there to respond to one  and they end up finding two to three more ” Dennehy said There have been other complications  The closest plant for hot mix asphalt  used to fill potholes  is closed on nights and weekends  limiting the window to pick up fresh material for repairs Work crews have   produced   that can be carried around in bags or buckets and do not need to be kept warm  Workers use those materials to repair holes on nights and weekends — about 15 percent of the potholes they repair — but the products do not fare as well in snow and frigid temperatures as the hot stuff  Dennehy said Then there are the repeat offenders  A pothole at the intersection of Avery and Washington streets in the Theater District has had to be repaired four times since the start of winter “It’s ‘Groundhog Day’  We’re returning to the holes we already fi  ” Dennehy said For the state  responding to the uptick in gaping asphalt craters has proven an expensive prospect  Officials estimate pothole filling efforts have cost  $420 000 so far this year T  Carter Ross  spokesman for the National Asphalt Pavement Association  an organization representing asphalt manufacturers and paving contractors  said other agencies around the East Coast have experienced similar budget zapping costs Those costs won’t be over once the weather warms up  Endemic potholes  even when they are promptly repaired  can weaken the entire roadway  They can also serve as a warning that a thoroughfare is due for warm weather upkeep Dennehy said his agency has been able to perform pothole filling duties without overtime  which is quite a feat  he said  considering that the workers responsible for pothole repairs are the same workers who salt the roads in advance of this season’s numerous snowstorms  Often  they have dealt with pothole repair and snow preparation in the same shift  It is a practice familiar to crews in Newton “The trick is as soon as you get out of the plow truck  you jump into the hotpot truck ” Turocy said Boston officials do not yet know how many drivers have filed claims to the city for damage to their cars after plowing through one of the craggy abysses    nThey are hopeful that the count will stay low “New Englanders ” Dennehy said  “they know how to swerve ”', '2014_1077')",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

to go only in the event of an actual emergency   u200bSeveral Massachusetts ambulance companies hope to bring back that quaint concept from long ago by branching into home health care  They plan to send paramedics to treat patients where they live instead of taking them to hospitals  a fundamental shift in how emergency medical services are delivered  nThe idea is to expand the paramedic’s role to a provider who not only responds to emergencies but also helps prevent them  treating patients with infections  minor wounds  injuries from falls  and problems associated with chronic diseases like diabetes and congestive heart failure  It could reduce unnecessary emergency room visits and hospital stays  which can cost thousands of dollars “We really do believe this is the new house call of the future ” said George Gilpin  chief executive of the Dorchester ambulance service EasCare LLC EasCare is poised to become one of the first ambulance companies in the state to provide such home care  launching a pilot program this summer with 2 000 patients of Commonwealth Care Alliance  a Greater Boston network of providers that serves the elderly  poor  and disabled  The program is expected to get approval from the state Department of Public Health soon  Several other ambulance companies are also seeking permission to offer home care services The move toward paramedicine  or integrated mobile health care  comes in response to state and federal laws — including the Affordable Care Act — that are pressuring the health care industry to control costs  The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services  the federal agency that insures the elderly and the poor  last year imposed penalties of $227 million on hospitals with high rates of patient readmission  down from $280 million in 2012 Private insurers  also aiming to keep costs down  increasingly offer incentives to providers for keeping patients out of the hospital when possible  nFor ambulance companies  home care represents a new source of revenue at a time when their core business is being squeezed by government and insurance company efforts to discourage costly emergency room visits and hospital stays Paramedics already play a role in home care in other states  including Texas  Colorado  and Minnesota  EasCare’s parent company  Medavie EMS of Dartmouth  Nova Scotia  provides home care in the Canadian province  Medavie’s pilot program showed that paramedic care eliminated emergency room visits for 73 percent of 135 seniors treated over nine months in 2011 The largest ambulance company in the United States  American Medical Response of Greenwood Village  Colo   has used paramedics to provide home care since 2010  starting in Arlington  Texas  It has since launched similar programs in more than a dozen cities and plans to expand the practice into Massachusetts  where it operates in 11 communities The emergency medical services industry has a wealth of knowledge about how patients get sick and injured at home  said Dr  Edward Racht  chief medical officer at American Medical Response  “We’re turning that around and saying  ‘Let’s improve care  let’s fix it before it happens ’ u2009” he said How ambulance companies deliver home care services vary  In some programs  they respond to calls from patients or providers  In others  they make scheduled visits  following up  for example  after patients are released from hospitals to ensure they take medications and adhere to doctors’ instructions EasCare  which plans to train as many as 10 paramedics to provide home care  will rely on referrals from its partner  Commonwealth Care Alliance  The network already maintains phone lines for patients to call for overnight problems  Staff provide whatever help they can  calling an ambulance if they think the patient needs to go to the hospital Now they will have another option  sending a paramedic EasCare paramedics would travel to these calls in a sport utility vehicle carrying medications and equipment  such as for performing blood tests  that regular ambulances don’t have  With access to electronic medical records  they would assess patients and contact their regular doctors before beginning a plan of care If they determine a patient needs to go the hospital  they call an ambulance “This really changes the whole way EMS is going to approach patients ” said Greg Davis  project manager at EasCare  “Sometimes we wondered if we really needed to take them to the hospital  Is there something we could have done for them in their home  This will give us that opportunity ”Fallon Ambulance Service of Quincy is seeking state approval of a home care program aimed at preventing a common cause of injury for the elderly  falls  In Fallon’s program  paramedics would survey homes for fall risks and make suggestions to fix them “That data is then shared with their primary care physician  or whoever’s managing their care ” said Patrick Tyler  chief operating officer at Fallon  “That closes the loop ”But Pat Kelleher  executive director of the trade group Home Care Alliance of Massachusetts  said it is unclear how paramedicine programs would work and whether they would help patients “We question whether  paramedics  — even with additional training — would be able to provide ongoing home based care of the type that these complex high hospital risk patients need ” she said in a statement The typical paramedic trains for 1 300 hours  EasCare requires another 300 hours of training for the medics who will be making home visits  Home health aides receive 75 hours of training but usually work alongside nurses Massachusetts has no specific regulations concerning paramedics providing home care services  so the Department of Public Health must approve the programs case by case  State health officials are generally supportive of the concept  which they believe “has the potential to both contain medical costs and enhance patient care ’’ said David Kibbe  department spokesman Insurance companies have not developed payment schedules for home services provided by paramedics  EasCare will be paid through its contract with Commonwealth Care Alliance  the companies didn’t disclose terms   Fallon has not announced any contracts yet  But both companies plan to collect data from their pilot programs to help design payment structures “In terms of the quality of care we will be able to deliver  it’s a game changer ” said Dr  Toyin Ajayi  hospitalist medical director and director of transitional medicine at Commonwealth Care Alliance

undermining his right to a fair trial The trial is now scheduled to start Jan  9 in Bristol Superior Court with Judge E  Susan Garsh presiding over jury selection  On Thursday  Garsh heard arguments from the defense and prosecutors on the defense’s motion for a change of venue before rejecting the request   t nAttorneys for Hernandez had hired a pollster who says too many Bristol County residents have already made up their minds “As the telephone polls conducted for the Defendant demonstrate  due to pre trial publicity the likes of which have perhaps never been seen in Massachusetts  a deep and objective jury pool simply does not exist in Bristol County ’’ the lawyers wrote on Tuesday But Bristol District Attorney C  Samuel Sutter’s office has said in court papers that they believe Hernandez can be fairly tried in Bristol County  In the same papers  defense lawyers also accused Sutter’s office of poaching ideas and phrases from federal prosecutors who are bringing the case against alleged Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev The defense lawyers wrote that Sutter’s office  in opposing their change of venue request  cut and pasted sections from documents that federal prosecutors had filed in the Tsarnaev case Tsarnaev’s lawyers had also asked for a change of venue  That request was denied late last month by the federal judge overseeing his case “Leaving aside all

that her girls participate in a program run by the recreation center in her apartment complex — and prescribed by the girls’ pediatrician  Many kids today don’t get outside enough  especially those without generous backyards or parents eager to lead them on nature walks  So area pediatricians are increasingly writing prescriptions to encourage kids and teens to spend time outside  particularly during the summer months  when the weather is good and the lack of structured activity can lead to weight gain  “Weight is just a symptom of the problem ” said Dr  Christina Scirica  medical director of the Outdoors Rx program run jointly by MassGeneral Hospital for Children and the Appalachian Mountain Club  “If I can get kids away from their computers  TV  and up off the couch and outside — that’s one of my major goals ”A number of programs around the country prescribe exercise or lifestyle changes for children and families  handing out jump ropes  gym memberships  coupons for fruits and vegetables  and  at MassGeneral  a certificate urging families to “Get up  get out and get active ” t n“Having a physician hand someone a prescription to do something actually does work ” said Scirica  who is also an instructor at Harvard Medical School  “Not 100 u2009percent of the time  but more than not having done it ”Weight problems start when people are young  and lifestyle improvements have to become part of a daily routine in order to have an effect  said Dr  Alan Meyers  a pediatrician at Boston Medical Center and associate professor at the Boston University School of Medicine “All of us  I think  are aware of how difficult that is ” said Meyers  who regularly writes prescriptions for his adolescent patients to ride Hubway bikes  “If you can get them to ride a bike instead of a bus  they’re going to burn up calories ” It took Meyers the better part of a year to arrange a deal with the Hubway bike sharing system and the City of Boston to allow teens to rent bikes without the credit card that is usually required  Meyers  who bikes to work from Cambridge nearly every day year round  said he’s not sure yet how well his bike program is working  He’s handed out a number of prescriptions  but hasn’t yet seen the patients again to check up on them  In the meantime  he said  he’s trying to convince more colleagues to prescribe bike riding  too The MassGeneral Appalachian Mountain Club Outdoors Rx program  which is also nearly a year old  has trained more than 60 health care practitioners to write prescriptions for outdoor time to treat asthma  obesity  and even ear infections The vitamin D your body makes from being exposed to sunlight builds strong bones  wards off infection  and helps kids with asthma breathe better  Scirica said  Having fun is also a great stress reliever and mood booster  she said  Studies have shown that being out in nature can lower blood pressure and reduce heart rate and stress Outdoors Rx has held free programs for more than 1 700 children and families so far  “Our goal is to reach as many kids as we can ” said Pam Hess  director of youth engagement with the program  who recently won a national award for her efforts Another Outdoors Rx message  Getting outside doesn’t have to be complicated  “I think people think of the outdoors as a mountain or the woods ” Scirica said  But all you need to do is go outside  “You can walk on pavement  or the grass  You can look at the bugs  run around after the fireflies          It doesn’t have to be a nature hike  It can be in the backyard of the rec center or the sidewalks to

the rec center  “The goal was to get them outside year round and get them more appreciative ” said Libby Stockwell Deegear  a former elementary school teacher who has led the weekly program  “I hope when they grow older  they’ll see outdoors as a place to be ”Stockwell Deegear was frustrated inside her Dorchester classroom when she had to force her students to sit down most of the day  This winter  she taught the children in Framingham to build snow forts  estimate how much water was in a glass full of snow  build fairy houses  and watch the giant tree in the yard turn colors  lose its leaves  and grow new ones  Her goal  she said  was also to provide “Unstructured play and freedom to be a kid ”Rivera said the program has been great for her daughters  giving them something else to do besides stare at a screen or climb the walls  “It’s awesome  There’s no more mess in my house ” Rivera said  because the girls are out biking  roller skating  or playing at the rec center  where they’ve also joined a Girl Scout troop  Rivera said the program has helped her  too  “I’m not a big outdoors person  I’m more of a computer person ” she said  but she recently went on a hike up nearby Tippling Rock for the first time  and surprised herself when she enjoyed it  “I can’t wait to go again ”Kay Debrosse  who runs the recreation center at Pelham Apartments  said she’s seen major changes in  kids since Outdoors Rx began  “They love outdoors more now ” Debrosse said  “They’re more willing to be helpful  to do something for others — not just for me  but for each other ” she said  Recently  a red tailed hawk sat atop a telephone pole at the complex  devouring a squirrel  A year ago  such a thing might have gone unnoticed  But a child taught to look up did — and Debrosse now has the cellphone photos to prove it  “They moan and groan when you tell them to get off their computer ” Debrosse said  “but then they don’t want to come back  inside  ”                    n Even when life gets busy  make outdoor time a priority  nTurn a walk into a scavenger hunt or a fun obstacle course   Keep supplies like toys  shoes  and sunscreen within reach and ready to go   nLet your kids see that you enjoy doing outdoor activities with them   With a little preparation and the right clothing  families can safely get outside in almost any weather  Doctors recommend no more than 2 hours

whites to be stopped repeatedly by police  and 12 percent more likely than whites to be frisked or searched during a stop  according to the study  which took into account factors such as criminal history  The report infuriated some police officials  who said the data were outdated and failed to note steps the department has taken in the past four years to train officers on addressing their biases Singleton said he wanted residents in Franklin Field  where the Raiders play home games  to remember the financial support the department has lent the team over the years  This year  the Boston

Christina Sterling  spokeswoman for the US attorney  nAuthorities said little about the other stations  but confirmed they opened a previous case against TOUCH and its founder  Charles L  Clemons Jr   after receiving a complaint last year that Clemons was using his station to promote his unsuccessful 2013 mayoral bid “Unlicensed broadcasting threatens the integrity of the regulatory structure established by the Communications Act to prevent chaos in the radio spectrum ’’ Federal Communications Commission official Vincent H  Bostic  who investigated the station  said in court documents   nNews of the raid sent shockwaves through Boston’s African American community  where the station filled a vacuum on the airwaves after the station WILD AM was sold “It’s such a shame ’’ said Trina Smith  a 39 year old Dorchester resident who tuned in regularly  “The station gave us information that you wouldn’t get unless you listened to it  Why do they want to shut it down ”Clemons  52  of Dorchester  appeared emotional but resolute Thursday  vowing “we will not be silenced” and saying he will fight the shutdown  He acknowledged running an unlicensed station  but said it “was the right thing to do’’ to fill a gap in the minority community  Obtaining a license to operate a station is expensive and often out of reach for many minority broadcasters  Clemons’s radio supporters said  nClemons said his station helped raise money to feed the homeless  for families faced with the  sudden burial of a relative  and for people struggling to find work  “How can you with a conscious mind shut down       a positive radio station like this ” Clemons asked  “There is no other radio station like this in the city of the Boston ”Known as “Brother Charles ’’ Clemons is the soothing voice on “The Morning Show ” which he hosted 6 to 10 a m  weekdays with sidekick “Sunshine ” He founded the station in 2007  calling it the fabric of the black community and attracting politicians of all stripes eager to get their message out to listeners along the spine of Blue Hill Avenue In addition to soulful and other music popular in the black community  the station was a sounding board for listeners concerned about diversity in city government  rampant shootings  and the chronic employment gap “If you want to know what is going on in this community  the only station that will let you do that is TOUCH 106 1 FM ’’ said Arthur Weeks of Roxbury Mayor Martin J  Walsh refrained from commenting on specifics about the shutdown  citing the investigation  “The mayor recognizes and understands the value that the medium of communication provides to the community  and he will continue to work with community leaders to assess the situation going forward ’’ said spokeswoman Kate Norton The 100 watt station is in Grove Hall  at 5 Cheney St  Its owners are listed as Leroy McLauren and John Laing  who did not respond to a request for comment Thursday  The station is in the basement of a nonprofit run by Clemons’s mother In court documents  US authorities detail their efforts to gain access to the station and their attempts to get Clemons to respond to inquiries In 2008  the FCC slapped Clemons and the station with a $17 000 fine for willfully running an illegal radio station  A US District Court judge issued a summary judgment against Clemons in February 2012 for not paying the fine “Mr  Clemons neither appealed the forfeiture order nor paid the $17 000 forfeiture ’’ court documents said In August 2013  the US attorney launched another investigation after receiving a

camera person taking pictures of me on my first day ” Walsh said later in an interview  describing what he found when he stepped out of his home  “I felt like it was my first day of school ”In many ways  Tuesday was like school  a crash course in being a big city mayor  Walsh’s day was a whirlwind of disparate tasks  He signed a flurry of documents to keep the bureaucracy grinding forward  announced six appointments to his administration  including two top staff members  got briefed on regulations for medical marijuana  heard about vacancies on the Public Health Commission board  and managed to give his security detail the slip as he explored the concrete corridors of City Hall  nThat was all before lunch  By the end of the day  he would have another string of  meetings and a dinner date with all 13 members of the City Council  significant others included  at Ruth’s Chris Steak House  at Old City Hall  nBetween meetings  Walsh acknowledged that one of his biggest challenges will be getting used to the furious pace  especially the first few months  as he assembles his team and restructures his Cabinet “At the State House  you sit down and talk about something  and then after a while you work it through ” Walsh said  “Here  you have to make decisions like today ”The six appointments began to provide definition to the nascent administration  Walsh tapped his close friend  Joyce Linehan  to be chief of policy  Linehan  no immediate relation to City Council President Bill Linehan  is an arts publicist and grass roots political organizer from Dorchester who joined Walsh’s mayoral campaign in its infancy  She had insisted for months that she would not join the administration but later changed her mind  “I would be nuts to turn it down ” Linehan said Walsh named another campaign adviser  Joseph Rull  as director of operations  Rull previously worked for the state and as an adviser to former mayor Thomas M  Menino  He lives in Norwell and will be required to move to Boston within six months  Rull’s role will be similar to Michael Kineavy’s in the Menino administration  overseeing day to day management  say Walsh’s advisers Walsh appointed another close friend  state Representative Eugene L  O’Flaherty  as the city’s corporation counsel  O’Flaherty lives in Chelsea and must also move to Boston Other appointments included Alejandra St

services  will serve as interim director of the Office of Small and Local Business Enterprise  Trinh T  Nguyen  chief of staff for the Boston Housing Authority  was appointed interim director of the Office of Jobs and Community Service After celebrating his inauguration deep into Monday evening  Walsh started Tuesday at home with a cup of tea and newspapers  He arrived at City Hall just after 9 a

elevator at City Hall  “I was there till probably 12  It was hard  So many people wanted to take pictures  I think I took more pictures yesterday than I have in my whole life ”On the fifth floor  the mayor’s office held reminders of Menino  who served 20 years and was the city’s longest serving chief executive  The office had the same 10 foot long mahogany table  the same desk lamps  and the same green leather couches  including the throw blanket decorated with the city seal   nMenino left a handful of knickknacks behind  including a bust of a young Abraham Lincoln  two paintings  and a framed

instead held court at the head of the 10 foot mahogany table “I will be a desk person ” Walsh said  but then he pointed to where Menino sat  “But I kind of like the seat there ”If there was a hiccup on day one  it came midmorning  when Walsh abandoned the mayor’s quarters to explore the floor above  He went office by office on the sixth floor to say hello to city workers  but forgot to notify his security team “I got scolded a bit because I’m not supposed to walk around the building without police ” Walsh said  “I kind of snuck out on them  which I will again ”“I’m the mayor of Boston ” he

Walsh was not yet sworn in as mayor when a top aide began counting down to when he would mark his 100th day in office  a milestone used by new officeholders to tout their political accomplishments and guide their future That was when the aide made a fateful discovery  Mayor Walsh’s 100th day would fall on April 15  exactly one year since the Boston Marathon bombings  nIt was telling  and prophetic Once Walsh and his team realized when his 100th day would arrive  they immediately changed course  That day would be reserved to honor Boston’s recovery from what terrorists had wrought  There would be no mayoral celebration on April 15  no speeches or press conferences about Walsh’s achievements  He would do those things at another time — April 16 — his 101st day That decision was an early indication of how unforeseen events  combined with a poignant past  came to define how Walsh  a former state legislator from Dorchester  has led since succeeding Mayor Thomas M  Menino “He’s been tested  no doubt about it ’’ said one of Walsh’s constituents  Bob Workman  a retired state trooper from Roxbury who has watched the new mayor in the first stretch of his four year term  nWhile Walsh has tried to set his own pace and follow his own agenda  he has lurched from one crisis or controversy to another  trying to gain a firm hold on the job  n nIn his first week in office  Walsh attempted to embark on a comprehensive violence prevention campaign  only to witness a surge in homicides  which prompted him to revive a controversial gun buy back program Two major snowstorms in his first weeks in office deflected attention from his initiatives and caused him to cancel his national coming out party as Boston’s new leader — a planned trip to Washington  D C   for a mayors’ conference Then Walsh expended significant political capital plunging into the St  Patrick’s Day parade controversy  trying — and failing — to broker a deal to allow a contingent of gay marchers And in late March  he found himself comforting his city after two Boston firefighters died while trapped in a burning Back Bay basement “Marty’s probably had to make more decisions in his first week as mayor than he did in his 16 years as a legislator — and that’s not to diminish his legislative job ’’ said John Tobin  a former Boston councilor  “He’s a man in charge now       who can’t afford to sit behind a desk  He has to be out there ”Walsh  now overseeing some 19 000 full time city employees  department heads  and the city itself  declined the Globe’s request for a formal interview before the 100 day marker out of respect for the Marathon anniversary  But in the days before the tributes  the mayor quietly cited his achievements  aiming to balance sensitivity to April 15 while spreading the word that he is a man in command Over the weekend  the mayor juggled a press conference laying out Marathon security and the separate announcement that the city had reached a tentative contract with the union representing Boston firefighters  the first time in more than a decade a deal has been reached without arbitration  Walsh had pledged during the campaign that as a former labor leader  he would be able to negotiate successfully with the fire union Among his achievements so far  Walsh revamped the top echelons of the Boston Police Department  installing a veteran officer as commissioner and naming the department’s first African American chief  He took on the Boston Redevelopment Authority  launching a review and firing 14 people from the agency’s business arm  while still moving forward with Boston’s building boom  such as the planned Fenway Center and the redevelopment of Dudley Square Walsh also consolidated his Cabinet  creating some roles and sharpening others  but his early hires were mostly white men from his inner circle from Dorchester and South Boston Walsh spoke briefly with a Globe reporter about his 100 days on the job  after an event on aging at the University of Massachusetts Boston last Thursday  which was also his 47th birthday “It’s been incredible ’’ Walsh said  “I don’t think roller coaster is the right word  Really  it’s been highs and lows ”Critics and supporters said among the highlights so far of Walsh’s administration has been his willingness to be visible in the neighborhoods  a skill virtually trademarked by Menino  who held the job for two decades  Walsh has attended community meetings and ribbon cuttings  and made a point to meet residents  including those at the margins of society Many residents and analysts who were interviewed lauded the mayor for putting his heart in the right place on issues such as his insistence that East Boston and Charlestown residents have a say in casino proposals on the city’s border  his early involvement in the effort to improve troubled schools  and his stance against two proposed marijuana dispensaries in the city Those residents said they were rooting for Walsh and willing to give him a break during the first months of his administration  n“In fairness  it takes a long time to get things accomplished ’’ said Jon Rudzinski  a 48 year old affordable housing developer from Roslindale  nOn the issue of diversity  Alisa Hunter  a 47 year old Dorchester resident and founder of the Professional Women of Color Network  said she is heartened by the mayor’s first steps  In February  he dispatched a top aide to her group to offer assurances that he was committed to diversity “It’s important to have women in key positions  But I’d like to see people who represent the cultural background of the city also included’’ in his administration  Hunter said  stressing that she would like to see more African Americans and other minorities on the mayor’s team When it comes to style and public persona  the mayor needs to relax on the job  said Cynthia Wellerbrady  a stay at home mother from West Roxbury “I think he should smile more  He looks so serious all the time ’’ said Wellerbrady  running errands on Centre Street recently  “And he has this entourage with him  Mayor Menino had one bodyguard  Mayor Walsh has an entourage — the whole Hollywood thing  He needs to enjoy life and smile ”The 100 day milestone was pioneered by Franklin D  Roosevelt at the height of the Depression and seen as one way to reassure an anxious public that the nation would pull through hard times  In his first 100 days  Roosevelt pushed through 15 major pieces of legislation that led to the restructuring of the financial market and reform While some analysts contend that 100 days is too soon to judge any political officeholder harshly — or to judge them at all — journalists  scholars  and politicians themselves embrace the marker  Walsh used that milestone to steer his transition team  asking them to report back on what he could reasonably accomplish in his first 100 days  That report is expected this week New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio  elected the same day as Walsh  spent his first 100 days pushing a string of broad policy initiatives  including trying to make good on a campaign pledge to tax the rich to pay for universal prekindergarten  Governor Andrew Cuomo scrapped the tax bid  but Cuomo did fund universal prekindergarten to the tune of $300 million De Blasio also signed a bill expanding the number of workers eligible for sick days  and he withdrew the city’s challenge to federal oversight of a controversial stop and frisk police tactic In Seattle  Ed Murray  a former state legislator and the city’s first openly gay mayor  has taken the lead in the minimum wage debate during his early days in office   He quickly kept the public up to date after a news helicopter crashed yards from the Space Needle In Boston  political observers acknowledge that Walsh had a hectic honeymoon period  They are willing to give him a pass for some stumbles out the blocks but said he has been slowly steadying himself Jeffrey Berry  a Tufts University political scientist  said that while Walsh has been adept at trying to connect with constituents  his leadership in the first 100 days sometimes seemed tentative and “undefined ”“He is an emotive mayor  one who is not afraid to show how he feels and how he cares about the city ’’ Berry said  “He’s been less successful in conveying a vision of where he wants to take the city  Broad public policy direction is unclear at this time ”Walsh took office after a weekend snowstorm in January  with thousands filling Conte Forum at Boston College cheering him on  With his longtime partner  Lorrie Higgins  and his mother  Mary Walsh  looking on  the mayor promised  “I will listen  I will learn  I will lead ”In his brief remarks with the Globe about these 100 days  Walsh said there is one moment that has stuck with him  when he received a call that 9 year old Janmarcos Pena had been shot  allegedly by his 14 year old brother in Mattapan “That was hard ’’ Walsh recalled  “As mayor  you don’t expect to get a call like that ”The job seems to change minute by minute  with no two days the same  the mayor said “One day I’m talking about Wicked Free Wi Fi ’’ Walsh said  referring to a network of Internet hotspots planned in the city  “And the next hour I’m talking about casinos  and the hour after that I’m giving a report on elderly care  Who knows what the next thing is ”Walsh said he expected a fast paced job  but not this “I’m getting used to it now ’’ he added  “Certainly  the last 30 days I’ve settled in to understand that that’s my life for now ”',

locals couldn’t understand him  his accent as thick as the rocky  russet land he left behind on the Aran Islands  off the west coast of Ireland  nOne day  at the Eire Pub in Adams Corner  a guy laughed and patted Ciaran Conneely on the back after being unable to make heads or tails of his name “We’ll just call you Kiwi ” the guy said  and the nickname stuck  nSo did Kiwi  who became a fixture in the Dorchester neighborhood  Like a lot of young Irish immigrants  he worked construction  and he worked hard  He played hard  too  and was known to frequent the Eire and The Bunker  the subterranean bar at the Old Dorchester Post On a warm October night in 2011  Kiwi left The Bunker and walked back up the hill on Adams Street after a day of craic and pints at the Irish Festival  He was about to enter his apartment building on Nahant Avenue when he was confronted by a small person holding a big gun “Give it up ” the gunman allegedly hissed Kiwi had been robbed weeks before  by a guy who swung wildly at him with a razor  I knew Kiwi  and I’m guessing he protested at having to give up his hard earned cash  again  to some shiftless thug  Whatever he said  we’ll never know  But according to a witness who testified in Suffolk Superior Court this week  the gunman was as confused as that guy at the Eire who bestowed Kiwi’s nickname “I couldn’t understand him ” the alleged gunman told the witness “I’m gonna count it down ” the alleged gunman snarled  pointing the gun at Kiwi  who swayed unsteadily in the moonlight  “Five  four  three  two  one ”And then the gunman pulled the trigger  The bullet bounced off Kiwi’s rib  punctured a lung  and ripped through his left ventricle before settling into the soft tissue of his lower back  Kiwi fell  hitting his face on the bumper of a pickup truck  before settling  on his back  dead on the sidewalk  just a few yards from his front door  He was 36  The gunman ran off  leaving behind a wad of cash in Kiwi’s pocket Suffolk County prosecutor Ian Polumbaum spent the last week trying to convince a jury that the gunman was a Dorchester kid named John Graham  who was 16 years old when he allegedly shot Kiwi Conneely But despite some compelling testimony and circumstantial evidence  it was always going to be a hard sell  They never found the weapon  There wasn’t any forensic evidence tying Graham to the scene  just testimony from those who say he confessed to the killing Bob Sheketoff  a good guy and a good lawyer  gave a robust defense  He told the jury they could not possibly believe Joel Winslow  Graham’s mentor  who testified against Graham  Sheketoff insisted Winslow was the getaway driver in Kiwi Conneely’s killing  And there was considerable evidence  including a video  that suggested Winslow was driving a Lexus seen near the homicide scene Sheketoff compared the case to Cain and Abel  the implication being that the older Joel Winslow figuratively buried his own figurative  younger brother  John Graham But this case was more about sisters  about the sister who testified as a prosecution witness against her own brother  and the two sisters who sat in the courtroom  bearing witness for the brother they loved and grew up with on a small  beautiful island in Ireland Tenesia Graham testified her little brother came to her after Kiwi was killed and blurted  “I was with Joel and I shot someone ”Noting that Tenesia Graham had a daughter with Joel Winslow  Sheketoff told the jury she had a motive to protect him  She was much closer to Winslow than her own brother But Ian Polumbaum  the prosecutor  asked the jury the most salient question  Why would a big sister frame her little brother  Besides  he said  she didn’t protect Winslow  Instead  she implicated him  along with her brother In the end  the jury sided with Bob Sheketoff’s version of events  maybe because they thought some of the prosecution’s witnesses should be prosecuted Kiwi Conneely’s sisters  Deirdre and Mary Ann  couldn’t look at the autopsy photos put up on the courtroom screen  It was even harder for them to look at the back of John Graham’s head when he was found not guilty Wednesday of the killing of their brother There was solace for them in that  as an ancillary part of the murder trial  Graham was convicted of shooting two Vietnamese kids 20 days after Kiwi Conneely fell dead  Ballistics tests showed the same gun that killed Kiwi wounded the two Vietnamese guys And so  John Graham faces 20 years or more when he is sentenced on May 1 Kiwi Conneely’s sisters  meanwhile  had the hardest task of all  They had to make that phone call back home  to tell their mother what happened A few hours after the verdict  Tommy Ashe sat at the bar at The Bunker  nursing a Coors Light  his head down  They call Tommy Ashe the Quiet Man because he is not a big talker  He works hard  as his good friend Kiwi did And as he sat there  in the country he adopted and the country he loves

and learning and instead let all of them operate autonomously  much like charter schools  according to a report being released Tuesday The premise of the recommendation is that schools best know the unique needs of their student populations and what measures might hold the most promise in boosting achievement  That  in turn  means the schools should have maximum latitude to make decisions regarding budgeting  staffing  curriculum  and length of school day  instead of being hemmed in by central offices or union contracts  the report concludes  nProviding all schools autonomy would be a dramatic departure from a one size fits all approach to overhauling education that has swept across the nation over the last two decades and has ushered in uniform curriculum  assessments  and other edicts from superintendents’ offices  That movement has flourished even as teachers and principals frequently complain that they are being forced to abandon effective methods for cookie cutter mandates not suitable for their students “Let people follow their passions as long as they are based on sound and reasonable theories ” said Dan French  executive director of the Center for Collaborative Education  a Boston nonprofit that prepared the report with Education Resource Strategies of Watertown “It’s common sense ” French said  “If you are going to hold a school accountable  then provide school leaders and faculty maximum control over decisions and resources ”The report —  — is scheduled to be unveiled at a breakfast forum  It was prepared for the School Department  which

where academic performance is sliding “What I do believe is access to autonomy is a necessary but not sufficient condition for school success ” said McDonough  noting that some traditional schools perform highly McDonough has taken steps in recent years to increase autonomy for all schools  This year  he has given principals more leeway to hire the teachers they want  and in his previous post as chief financial officer  he devised a funding method that gives schools more discretion in how they spend their district allocated budgets Expanding autonomy has been a lightning rod in public education  often because some of those pushing it are business leaders  Many educators  even as they crave more independence  scoff at any perception of businesses influencing educational policy and sometimes see the push for autonomous schools as an effort to diminish teacher unions and to ultimately privatize public education Richard Stutman  president of the Boston Teachers Union  said a number of reasons beyond educational merit are fueling the movement “On the one hand  many parents are demanding choice  and autonomous schools  as distinct from traditional schools  gives the illusion of choice ” Stutman said  “On the other hand  granting autonomy to more and more schools  like charters  will eventually lead to a dissolution of the public school system as we know it ’’Such a dramatic outcome  he added  “will hurt choice in the long run  even as it makes some  especially those who favor the corporatization of our school system  quite happy ”Boston currently runs a hybrid system  About a third of the system’s 128 schools operate with varying degrees of flexibility from central office mandates and union contract provisions  The schools are known as either pilot  innovation  turnaround  or in district charter schools While many of Boston’s autonomous schools tend to achieve stronger results  some have suffered from chronically low achievement  Just last fall  the state moved to take over two elementary schools  the Dever and the Holland in Dorchester  three years after the state gave them high degrees of autonomy to assist with turnaround efforts Paul Grogan  president of the Boston Foundation  said the report makes clear that the successes of autonomous schools far outweigh any shortcomings and that all schools in the system should become autonomous “After 20 years of experimenting with various models  the view put forward by this report is this works  and this is the future  and let’s embrace it  rather than staying in the middle ” Grogan said Boston has had a fickle history with autonomous schools  It tried  with much fanfare  more than two decades ago to give all schools more control of budgeting  staffing  and curriculum decisions  But that effort faltered because of resistance from the teachers union  the refusal of various departments in the central office to relinquish control  and a change in superintendents Boston revived its experiment with autonomous schools a few years later as the state prepared to open charter schools in the city that would operate completely independently of the school system  In response  the School Department worked out an agreement with the teachers union to start “pilot schools ” which operate with some autonomy from the central office  n•  n•  n•  n',

said Monday in a telephone interview At first  Forry said  he thought a friend had approached him from behind and was playing a joke  But when he realized that he was being attacked  Forry said  he was unable to yell “I couldn’t breathe and I couldn’t yell  ‘I can’t breathe ’ ” he said The attack took place within 20 yards of the park’s entrance on Dorchester Avenue  Forry said He said he had

estimated that he lost consciousness within eight seconds and fell to the ground  “It was just instantaneous ” Forry said  He said he never saw his attacker and does not know whether it was a man or a woman Forry said he believes he regained consciousness within 30 seconds to five minutes and found himself coming to  as if waking from sleep  he said “I realized that  frankly  I was still alive ” Forry said His eyeglasses were still on his face  but his right shoe and sock had been removed  Forry said   “I literally don’t have a mark on me ” he said The robber did not take Forry’s keys or cellphone  so Forry said he called 911 and spoke with a woman who asked for the address where the attack happened  A Boston police officer reached the park about 5 45 p m   according to a police

is audible as the teacher outlines the choices for enrichment activities Talk to students and it quickly becomes clear that they love their school because it feels fun and safe and is focused on making sure they’re learning  And they are  The recent MCAS results were big for the UP  as in  Unlocking Potential  Education Network  which now runs three schools in Boston and two in Lawrence    Two of the Boston schools  the former Gavin Middle School in South Boston and the former Marshall  are in district charters that Boston picked UP to set up and run  the state turned the Holland over to UP after putting the school into receivership   For example  UP Academy Dorchester posted the biggest one year increase in combined math and English MCAS proficiency  UP Academy Boston  the former Gavin  showed the most student growth in math of all schools serving the middle grades  In Lawrence  UP Academy Oliver quadrupled its sixth graders’ proficiency rate in math   nIndeed  UP academies are helping demonstrate how urban schools can be transformed  Which is part of the plan  When cofounders Scott Given  a former teacher and Harvard Business School graduate  and Yutaka Tamura  another education innovator  started the nonprofit education network in 2010  “one of the things we wanted to prove is that if you take the same student population that has always been in a school  and you surround them with really strong educational practices  including many of the practices some charter schools are using  those same students can succeed at really high levels ” says Given  That’s important for the debate  since charter school opponents often dismiss strong charter results almost reflexively  One common argument is that charter students succeed mainly because they have more involved parents  Another is that charters do well mostly because they usually have fewer English language learners or students with disabilities  But UP strives to keep the same students when it restarts a school  UP Academy Dorchester  for example  has retained 80 percent of the former Marshall school students  a significantly better rate than the Marshall itself had What’s really changed is the educational approach  Not only do kids spend an extra hour and a half a day in school  but the school year is also five days longer than the Boston school system’s 180 days The faculty is different as well  Upon taking over a school  UP recruits its own teaching staff   UP invites the former faculty to reapply  but few do  Given says   If they aren’t already members  teachers must join the Boston Teachers Union  and are paid according the union scale  They work a considerably longer day and year  however  nine hours rather than the contractual 6 5 hour day in Boston’s regular elementary school day or the 6 hour and 40 minute day for regular public middle schools  They also work much of August  concentrating on professional development  teaching methods  and team building  Now  that rigorous a schedule obviously isn’t for everyone  Still  UP hasn’t had any trouble recruiting teachers willing to embrace it  some 4 100 educators applied for 60 jobs in its first school restart  Given says  To make school enjoyable  UP features songs and celebrations and enrichment like music and visual arts  plus phys  ed  Expectations are high  with an emphasis on charting a path

opportunity to make Boston the safest city in the country ” he said  Roca started accepting young men into the program in January  when it became the program that pay for success  which is expanding

and wine makers Executives with the nonprofit organization behind the market said some vendors will begin selling products in an outdoor plaza along the Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy Greenway this spring  Meanwhile  construction will proceed next door on a facility scheduled to open in early 2015 “This market will allow us to show off the best of what our small farms and agricultural producers have to offer ” said Governor Deval Patrick  whose administration has committed $4 million to help with the facility’s construction  “There are a lot of wonderful things grown and made in Massachusetts that people ought to know about ”The portion of the market to open this spring will have space for 13 to 15 vendors selling fresh produce  flowers  specialty foods  and other items  Those vendors will be moving from City Hall Plaza and operate two days a week at 136 Blackstone St “I’m confident that the idea of this market is good enough and strong enough to move forward  and that it has the potential to really change Boston ” said Elizabeth Morningstar  chief executive of the nonprofit Boston Public Market Morningstar  a former political director for Patrick  said her organization still needs millions of dollars in donations to complete construction and open the facility  But she said the group has raised enough money — about $8 million in state and private funds so far — to begin renovating a 28 000 square foot space above the Haymarket subway station Once completed  the indoor market will host about 40 vendors selling a wide array of local products  including fish  cheese  meats  produce  flowers  and specialty items  It is designed to function like a daily farmer’s market  But vendors will also offer prepared foods and dry goods such as books  candles  and cooking utensils A draft layout also includes space for a demonstration kitchen  where chefs could host cooking classes  as well as a 3 000 square foot restaurant facing the greenway  Executives with the

market who also owns the Ashmont Grill and Tavolo restaurants in Dorchester  “We want to have space for people to actually take a break and sit down  Maybe they’re going shopping and they want to meet friends  eat  socialize and enjoy a craft beer ”Plans for the market have been under development for more than a decade  Boston is one of only a few cities its size without a standing public market

the Henry P  Kendall Foundation in Boston  a family foundation focused on improving access to fresh foods  “Leading scholars suggest that more than 50 percent of our food can come from this region ”Kendall’s foundation has given $1 million to the market  one of several large donations that have helped to get the effort off the ground The project has been delayed due to the political and logistical complexities of renovating the state owned building at the Haymarket MBTA stop  The building functions as a vent stack for the Interstate 93 tunnel  which means its renovations must be approved by state and federal transportation regulators Currently  the floor of the market is uneven and interrupted by massive concrete columns  The ceilings are covered in a maze of pipes and wires  and new water and electrical connections must be added to support vendors’ operations Despite the heavy workload  some farmers backing the market say they are encouraged by its recent progress “I’m more confident now than I was a few years ago ” said Glenn Stillman  owner of Stillman’s Farm in  u2009New Braintree  “I always figured it was an inevitability  But getting things done in Boston — everything starts with  ‘No ’ and  ‘What’s in it for me ’”But Stillman said he believes that the current management can fight through the maze of red tape and political maneuvering to get the project done  He said it could significantly expand his access to consumers and restaurateurs who are increasingly interested in buying local foods “I wouldn’t be surprised if it added 50 percent in sales ”

of holding down a woman and punching her in the chest after she refused to have sex with him Soon after the 37 year old Dorchester Democrat was led away from the courtroom in handcuffs  colleagues in

Henriquez refuses to step down Governor Deval Patrick and Mayor Martin J  Walsh of Boston  a Democrat who served alongside Henriquez in the Legislature  echoed the calls for his resignation  Henriquez endorsed and campaigned for Walsh in the mayoral race “This is a sad day for the Fifth Suffolk district ” Walsh said  referring to the district Henriquez represents  which covers parts of Roxbury and Dorchester  “Violence against women is an epidemic and is totally and universally unacceptable ”Jurors convicted Henriquez of some of the acts of violence he was accused of  but acquitted him of others   The lawmaker was found guilty of two counts of assault and battery  but he was acquitted of a charge that he had struck the victim in her face  Jurors also found Henriquez not guilty of witness intimidation and larceny Dressed in a dark suit and tie  Henriquez was without expression as Cambridge District Court Judge Michele Hogan said she was sending him to prison in part because of the serious nature of his crime and because of his refusal to accept responsibility for his actions “When a woman tells you she doesn’t want to have sex  that means she does not want to have sex ” Hogan said  “You don’t hit her  You don’t punch her          I’m very concerned that you’re not remorseful ”Hogan sentenced Henriquez to 2½ years in the House of Correction but ordered him to serve only six months of the sentence Middlesex prosecutors had asked that Henriquez be ordered to serve one year of a 2½ year sentence  the maximum for assault and battery Stephanie Soriano Mills  Henriquez’s lawyer  had asked Hogan to sentence Henriquez to probation  citing his clean record and the jury’s decision to acquit on some of the charges  She called the sentence harsh  n“I don t believe that same sentence may have been given to other defendants who may have come before this court ” she said Soriano Mills vowed to appeal the verdict  She said she did not know whether Henriquez plans to resign his seat Other defense lawyers agreed that it is extremely unusual for a defendant with no prior criminal record to be sent to jail for a misdemeanor conviction  First time offenders are typically sentenced to two years of probation and ordered to attend a batterer’s program  said Michael Tumposky  a Boston criminal defense lawyer who has been following the case “If the judge increased the sentence because he refused to accept responsibility  I think that’s wrong ” he said  “A defendant should never be punished for asserting his constitutional right against self incrimination  even after a guilty verdict ”Toni Troop  a spokeswoman for Jane Doe  a statewide coalition that advocates for victims of domestic violence  said that the court sent a clear message to offenders that they will be held accountable “The truth is that too often victims do not get this kind of justice in domestic violence cases ” she said  “The sentence should be the norm  not the exception ”The victim  Katherine Gonzalves  testified that on July 8  2012  Henriquez picked her up in Arlington  They began kissing in the car  but when Gonzalves  who was 23 at the time  told Henriquez she wanted to go back inside her mother’s house  he began yelling at her  she testified  The argument became violent  Gonzalves testified  adding that she began to use her cellphone to take pictures of Henriquez threatening her She said Henriquez grabbed her cellphone  then drove her to Boston  where she jumped out of the car and got help from Boston and Northeastern University police Prosecutors showed the jury photos of Gonzalves’s body  which was covered in bruises “I remember being back handed  I remember being held down  I remember being punched ” Gonzalves said during her testimony Soriano Mills tried to portray Gonzalves as an embittered woman whose accusations were motivated by anger over Henriquez’s refusal to make their relationship more serious  She also said that

governor since he was 28 — dove into his first full day as governor elect without any formal celebration  focused instead on the nuts and bolts of assembling a transition team and confronting the policy challenges ahead  t nHis razor thin victory was settled only at 8 15 a m  Wednesday  when Democrat Martha Coakley called him to concede more than 12 hours after the polls had closed — and long after his supporters had gone home  Baker claimed the mantle of governor elect three hours later  at a low key press conference at which he said he was eager “to start doing the hard work” of putting together a team to take office in January  Later  he went to meet with Governor Deval Patrick to discuss the transition Of his win  Baker said  “It is the honor of a lifetime and something that I will cherish every single day ” Tuesday’s unusually long and tense Election Night had so many twists and turns that both candidates described it as a roller coaster  “We were up  We were down  We were in  We were out ” Coakley said  likening the whiplash twists and turns of the election returns to a Dr  Seuss tale  nBy midnight  the edge Baker held was narrow enough to keep Coakley’s hopes alive and to postpone a concession speech before final numbers could be verified  That robbed Baker of a victory address at his campaign headquarters  where fired up supporters had been waiting for hours to hear the news  But it also showed Baker — a candidate who struggled with his hard edges in 2010 and was trying to showcase his empathic side during this campaign — in his best light  When he did speak early Wednesday morning  he told raucous supporters he’d agreed with Coakley to wait until the morning for the final vote tally  “I’ve been on both sides of this ” he said Wednesday afternoon  “I thought it was a perfectly reasonable position to take ”He had already spoken privately to Coakley  agreeing to give her time to sleep on the results  “In the end  he could not have been more gracious last night  making sure that we got the tally ” Coakley said   “And he could not have been more gracious this morning  when I called him to say  ‘Congratulations  Charlie  Great race ’ u2009”Twelve hours after she had hoped to take the stage as Massachusetts’ first female governor  Coakley took to the podium at her Somerville campaign headquarters to accept defeat  The candidate who so famously lost the state’s special election for US Senate four years ago conceded the governorship and said she had no regrets about the way she had run the race  “I understand there’s only one winner  and I understand Charlie Baker won  but I could not be prouder of the race we won — ran — and the people who helped me do that ” she said After a race in which gender issues played a starring role  Coakley spoke of the opportunities she has been able to seize as a woman of her generation  having joined the first class of women to graduate from Williams College   “I had a chance to go to law school  My mom didn’t have a chance to go to college ” she said  choking up And despite her loss  she encouraged women who aspire to politics to seize opportunities as well and follow the example of fellow elected officials US Representative Katherine Clark  US Senator Elizabeth Warren  and the newly elected attorney general  Maura Healey  “It’s important that you lean in ” Coakley told the crowd  “For every woman who didn’t get the job she wanted or didn’t get the promotion  or who ran a race and lost  I say  go right back at it  Throw your hat back in the ring ”Baker ended up winning the race by 40 361 votes  His victory put Republicans back at the top of Massachusetts state government  after eight years of exile under Patrick  whom Baker had tried unsuccessfully to unseat four years ago  On Wednesday  Baker arrived a few minutes early for his first meeting with Patrick as governor elect  He strode into the governor’s office   shook hands with a few Patrick staffers  then disappeared behind closed doors to meet with Patrick in his ornate suite The meeting was closely watched not only because of its symbolic importance  but also because Baker and Patrick were bitter rivals from the 2010 governor’s race and exchanged harsh words in this election  Patrick  who campaigned energetically for Coakley  had accused Baker of having an “authenticity problem” for shedding many of his conservative positions from the 2010 campaign  and had said on election eve  n“I feel like kicking a little Republican ass right now ” Baker  in turn  repeatedly blamed Patrick for serious managerial problems  including bungled cases at the Department of Children and Families  the troubled rollout of medical marijuana dispensaries  and the costly failure of the state’s health care website On Wednesday  the two were scheduled to meet for 30 minutes but huddled for about 40  When they emerged to greet the press  both were cordial but displayed no warmth or rapport  as Baker stood a short distance from Patrick  his hands in his suit pockets  Both men took turns at the same microphone  speaking cordially  while dismissing repeated questions about the attacks they had traded during the race They vowed to work together to smoothly hand off the reins of power  Patrick said he had urged Baker to have fun in the job but said they had talked about more sober issues  including the state’s health care website and the threat posed by the Ebola virus The governor said he had urged Baker to “find the parts of the job that are fun and keep going back to those and let folks know you’re having a good time ”“We as citizens  not just as people in public life  want our governors to succeed  and I want Charlie to succeed ” Patrick said  nOnly in the evening did Baker seem to publicly savor his victory  when he hoisted a pint of Guinness at the Eire Pub in Dorchester  celebrating with supporters who had not gotten a chance to raise a glass in his honor Tuesday  “Here’s to the governor ” one patron yelled out  “Taste good ” another asked  as Baker took his first sip    “Sure does ” he said   n n n',

suspect killed Evelin Valibayova  nAnd  if they are right  Valibayova was murdered by a monstrous man  a convicted kidnapper paroled in 2006  years earlier than the wishes of the federal judge who sent him away for 75 years  t nValibayova  a native of Azerbaijan  was last seen in mid July 2011  caught on surveillance video as she exited the North Quincy Station on the Red Line  Since then  authorities have said only that they had found forensic evidence in her bedroom — and had a person of interest in the case The Norfolk district attorney’s office  in a court filing this week  for the first time has  identified the chief suspect in her disappearance and apparent murder He’s John D  Castonguay  who in 1986 lured a 9 year old girl walking her puppy in Woonsocket  R I   to a remote area of Blackstone  Mass   where he sexually and physically assaulted her in a gravel pit  leaving her naked and bleeding  tying a rope across her mouth  according to court records When Castonguay was sentenced for the brutal crime in June 1987  US District Court Judge Mark L  Wolf virtually predicted that Castonguay  whom he called “very dangerous as well as very devious ’’  would offend again “The information available to me suggests that if you were back in the community  you would be susceptible          to committing another brutal offense ’’ Wolf told Castonguay  who is now 52  as he sentenced him to 75 years in federal prison  In a court document filed this week in Norfolk Superior Court  authorities essentially said that Wolf’s sentencing remarks were prescient And  for Valibayova  officials believe the consequences were deadly Castonguay “was working as a handyman in her building at the time of her disappearance ’’ the court document states  “he had keys and unfettered access to her apartment  and he admitted to being in her apartment  including cleaning the apartment after her disappearance   Castonguay  remains a suspect in this case ’’Castonguay has not been charged in her disappearance or presumed death Valibayova is described by her family and friends as a bright  ambitious  and multilingual woman  trying to seize her part of the American dream  before she vanished “Beautiful  black eyed  black hair  incredibly charismatic — and very smart ’’ said Duncan Boyd  who was in a relationship with Valibayova when she disappeared  “She would admit to speaking eight languages but I think it was closer to a dozen ’’Boyd said Valibayova told him Castonguay was performing repair work at her Hodges Avenue apartment shortly before her disappearance  “She was uncomfortable being alone there with him ’’ Boyd said  “His presence made her uncomfortable for personal safety reasons  For lack of a better term  she thought he was creepy ’’Valibayova had planned to video chat via Skype with her mother in Azerbaijan the day after she was last seen  But she missed that appointment Boyd became alarmed about Valibayova’s whereabouts after she failed to report for a shift at a Cambridge restaurant  he accompanied Quincy police to Hodges Avenue within days of her disappearance  The apartment was unlocked and most of Valibayova’s possessions  including some important personal documents  were missing Noting that authorities had recovered substantial forensic evidence from her bedroom  Boyd said  “There’s no way she could have lost that much blood and not be admitted to a hospital ’’Boyd said authorities checked local hospitals and found that his girlfriend had not been treated in any of them “Evelin was murdered in her apartment and her body was disappeared ’’ said Boyd Investigators later found some of her belongings  including a brown shoulder bag  her cellphone  wallet  and other papers dumped in a Dorchester neighborhood Without a body  pursuit of a murder indictment against Castonguay is problematic Castonguay was paroled on Aug  30  2006  after serving time for kidnapping  His parole was revoked late last November  nPeter Carr  a spokesman for the criminal division of the Department of Justice  said he could not discuss the rationale for Castonguay’s original release or the circumstances of his reincarceration last year He was arraigned on Thursday in Norfolk Superior Court on new charges relating to violation of his parole  Before that  he had been incarcerated at the federal prison in Fort Dix  N J  He remains in custody Attempts to reach attorneys who have previously represented Castonguay were unsuccessful on Friday News of the identification of a suspect in her disappearance was sobering for close friends who remembered her as a woman whose eyes were fi  firmly on a bright future “It definitely has changed me ’’ said Christian Thornton  who owns a restaurant on Martha’s Vineyard where Valibayova worked  She also worked as a nanny for his two children  “She’s a remarkable young woman ’’ he said  “Her drive  her own investment in her future  and her education was impressive  Just terribly  terribly bright  There’s rarely a day that goes by when I don’t think of her ’’Katie Murashka  whose friendship with Valibayova began when they both worked on Martha’s Vineyard  said her friend dreamed of becoming a successful businesswoman “She had very ambitious plans for herself and her future and she was ready to work for it ’’ Murashka said  “It’s a tragedy that something happened along the way ’’Perhaps the roots of that tragedy can be found in the answer to this question  Why did Castonguay get out so early  Wolf sentenced Castonguay to 75 years  and had set a minimum sentence of 25 Castonguay went to court and successfully challenged it At issue was a federal law on the books at that time that said a prisoner was eligible for parole after serving one third of his term or after serving 10 years of a life sentence or a sentence of more than 30 years Castonguay argued that the federal law required that he become eligible for parole after he had served the lesser of either one third of his sentence or 10 years An appeals court ruled that Wolf “exceeded  his   authority in setting as a minimum sentence  which must be served before parole eligibility could be considered  a term of 25 years  The sentence is vacated ”OK  So the law says this man — this criminal who lured a 9 year old girl into the woods by telling her he knew a great place to pick blueberries — was technically eligible for early release  Fine  But a former federal prosecutor told me that parole authorities now have some explaining to do “It’s pure lunacy to think that a man who kidnaps and rapes

allow shoppers to make donations at checkout  the new restaurant initiative is designed to give people an effortless way to give to those in need   t n“If you make the act of giving or volunteering

the prevalence of so called “pirate radio” not just in Boston  but also in its suburbs Of the three stations raided by federal agents  one transmitted out of Everett  Brockton  and Boston  while another was solely Brockton based  according to the US attorney’s Boston office  which initiated the cases  t nSince 2003  the Federal Communications Commission has taken enforcement action 37 times against illegal radio stations operating in Eastern Massachusetts  The bulk of those actions have come against low frequency stations in Brockton broadcasting to the city’s vast Cape Verdean and Haitian populations Although illegal  such radio stations are a vital resource in immigrant and minority neighborhoods that are underserved by commercial mainstream broadcasters  advocates contend  In addition to playing music with an ethnic flair that’s heard nowhere else on the dial  many unlicensed community radio stations feature talk programming that encourages listener participation on topical issues such as immigration  local and international politics  and sports from back home  “It’s sad to see that  federal agents  shut them down  because even though they are pirate stations  they truly are the main source of communication in those communities ” said Yessenia Alfaro  director of organizing at   a social justice nonprofit  “It certainly has a negative impact when they shut these down  They are the main outreach vehicle for people who speak a different language ”Some outfits  like  in Waltham  opt to have an online presence outside of radio  but many new immigrants and low income families have no access to computers or can’t afford the monthly bills for Internet access  Alfaro said  Many also cannot read  even in their native language  rendering radio the only source for information  she added Despite the potential for tens of thousands of dollars in fines and seizure of transmitting equipment  “pirates” continue to take the risk in order to serve the underserved  said Bruce Conti  a longtime radio enthusiast from Nashua and the international radio columnist for the  magazine DX News  n t nEven if they have tried to operate legally  most individuals have been priced out of potential station ownership under rela  FCC rules that have the majority of radio stations owned by large corporations  like Clear Channel and CBS  Conti said in an e mail  There are also no available open broadcasting channels to be had in Greater Boston “So an interested buyer can only wait for an existing radio station to become available for sale  again driving up the cost of entry ” he wrote  “Licensed commercial radio stations in the Boston metro area have abandoned service to the inner city  so most          pirate radio stations in Boston are filling a void ”Among those shut down last month was Radio Tele Boston  nwhich transmitted at 100 1 FM out of homes on Walnut Street in Everett and North Manchester Street in Brockton  and two locations in the Mattapan and Dorchester neighborhoods of Boston  according to court documents  The operator was listed as Gerlens Cesar of Brockton  A man who answered the phone of a number listed for “Cesar Gerlens” in Brockton stated that he only spoke Creole and was unable to comment The other Brockton station  88 7 FM  was transmitting out of a two family house on Crescent Street  Federal agents sent a notice last August to building owner Solange Germain after receiving a complaint that the station was causing interference with Boston station WERS on 88 9 FM  Agents seized the station’s equipment last month  Germain could not be reached for comment The stations were shut down for violating the Communications Act of 1934  which bans operation of unlicensed radio stations  Due to the FCC’s limited enforcement staff  some stations operate unmonitored for long periods of time  said Assistant US Attorney Christine Wichers  who is prosecuting the three cases from last month  Even when the FCC becomes aware of an unlicensed station  usually after complaints from licensed operators  it sends multiple notices to operators asking them to shut down voluntarily before taking more aggressive action  such as seizing equipment or issuing fines  she added “I think it’s sort of silly when people say the FCC is trying to put out of business good community stations serving people ” Wichers said  “To me it’s like  ‘Look at that person — they’re so nice driving the elderly to appointments  but they don’t have a driver’s license ’”Some pirate station operators will voluntarily shut down after receiving a violation notice from the FCC  but only temporarily  In many cases  even after equipment is seized  the same pirate station will be back on the air within months  based on the number of FCC notices issued to repeat offenders Brockton City Councilor Moises M  Rodrigues said that “99 percent of the elected officials in this community have gone on those stations  including me ” Among the most popular in the community is Brockton Heat  an unlicensed station that serves the Cape Verdean and Haitian communities  he said The stations “provide some valuable vital information to the community ” Rodrigues said  “None of us connected or otherwise are proponents of illegality in any way  but there’s a great need for information reaching into these bilingual communities  Especially if you’re a bilingual community  other than the Hispanic community  you have absolutely no way of getting or gathering information at all from’’ licensed radio stations in the area  nWhile an increasing number of unlicensed station operators are making the switch from radio to the unregulated online world  many still choose traditional radio because equipment like transmitters  especially used gear   is relatively inexpensive  said T  Barton Carter  a professor of communication law at Boston University  Opening a station can cost tens of thousands of dollars up front  not including application and certification fees  whereas illegal stations can run on just a few hundred dollars’ worth of equipment easily purchased online  he said “There just is an availability issue ” Carter said  A large commercial station  he said  is going to try to find the largest audience  “so you can argue that that does prevent people from being served — very specific minorities ”To address this  Congress approved the Local Community Radio Act  which opened up low power FM stations for noncommercial uses  but there   A window to apply for a low power FM license opened briefly last fall  from Oct  17 to Nov  14   n nbut it is unknown when or whether there will be another opportunity  Carter said This is why Radio Uganda Boston is only available online  said Geoffrey Nsereko  the station’s public relations director  Organizers attempted to lease air time at a licensed radio station  but at $2 500 for each three hour block  it was an investment the station could not afford  Nsereko said  Priced out of the airwaves and not interested in operating without a license  Radio Uganda Boston has been streaming solely online since 2009

 “Everyone here is awesome        It’s sad that we are in this predicament  but there is a way out ”They’re in this predicament because the raggedy bridge to Long Island was shuttered in October  Williams  47  used to live there  on that island  in a city run shelter Now  she and 24 other homeless women are living temporarily at St  Francis House  a shelter on Boylston Street  They sleep on cots in the atrium and dining room  When she arrived  Williams  a veteran of 18 years on the streets  carried just a few clothes and a backpack filled with personal items and her Bible  nShe remains confident better days stretch ahead for the city’s homeless  “People now realize that a lot of people need a place to live ” she said Williams  a woman of faith  finds comfort in the words of St  Matthew  “Seek and you will find  knock and the door will be opened to you ”“I meditate on that ” she said Williams  a recovering alcoholic and drug addict  lived on cold city streets until she knocked on the door of a city run shelter on Feb  4  2013  “I’ve been clean for one year and nine months ”She qualified for a federal housing subsidy  and hopes to move into an apartment soon in Dorchester  where she grew up “I’m looking forward to cooking Thanksgiving dinner there next year for my family and friends ” Williams said  n nAt Boston’s Pine Street Inn  meeting the homeless where they are began about 20 years ago with a man named George Sweet and sort of hopeless  a gentleman and an alcoholic  George was in his mid 60s when he turned up dead in a snowbank on Berkeley Street one cold morning “It was heartbreaking to lose him five or six blocks from here ” said Lyndia Downie  Pine Street’s president  “We realized we needed to help them get here ”Today  that’s Mike Andrick’s job  Director of outreach for Pine Street  Andrick supervises teams who scour the city night and day  in vans and on foot  treating the most acute homelessness where it lives Outreach is lifesaving work  particularly overnight in the cold  It is also taxing — the team of about 10 gets lots of training  including for the tellingly named “compassion fatigue ” Teams identify and visit hot spots  They nudge people toward a warm bed by first finding people where they are  physically and psychologically On Thursday  Andrick led tours for families who brought their children to volunteer at Pine Street’s  Thanksgiving dinner  He showed them vans that would be delivering turkey sandwiches and hot cocoa  hats and gloves to people spending the holiday in parks and under overpasses Some things are hard to explain to children  Putting problems like mental illness and substance abuse into perspective means starting with something relatable — some small trauma familiar to kids for whom the troubles of homelessness are mercifully foreign And so Andrick begins by meeting them where they are “Has anybody ever broken their arm ” n nThey have a system for making sandwiches  and in the busy kitchen at the Pine Street Inn on Thursday morning  the Iannone family of Whitman launched into action like seasoned pros Anthony  20 — the middle child  and the only boy — laid out slabs of bread and piled on sliced turkey  Then he passed them down the counter to Paulette  his 17 year old sister  who slathered on cranberry sauce  Next in line stood Joe  their dad  who scooped on the stuffing  Finally  another sister  Kasey  24  packaged each sandwich in plastic wrap and kept track of the tally For years  the Iannones have volunteered here on Thanksgiving  This year  their help was needed more than ever  The homeless shelter  which normally prepares 2 000 meals a day  has served twice as many since the Long Island shelter closed last month  The sandwiches the family made were loaded onto a van and hand delivered all across the city by outreach workers As metal trays clattered and steam rose from dozens of turkeys — and Chubby Checker’s “The Twist” blared from portable speakers — the Iannones moved to their next task  slicing and plating pecan pies  At home  mom  Helen  and two other sisters  Jaclyn and Bridget  were preparing the family’s own feast  All of them felt lucky  helping at the shelter was one way to show it “The difference between  homeless  people and us is just a wrong turn ” said Joe  54  a salesman He started chopping red peppers for Friday  when people would be hungry again  n nMisty Bergeron felt unsettled Wednesday night  She had a holiday pass from her recovery program at Shepherd House in Dorchester on Thanksgiving  her 36th birthday Her disease told her   nShe prayed  then slept  When she woke up Thursday she decided   She knows how lucky she is  This summer  after years of using painkillers and alcohol  she found herself homeless  without her children  wandering the streets of Worcester “I felt like a failure — as a daughter  as a parent  as a productive member of society ” she said So she checked into detox

cussing  One of them compels Nelson to travel a darkened city every morning  while most of Boston sleeps   nShe’s a cat lady  a member of a small  rag tag  passionately committed  largely invisible and  yes  possibly unhinged  army of men and women who tend to street cats all over Massachusetts  She feeds and provides makeshift shelters for cats who have lost their homes or never had one  She traps them so that they can get vaccinations and flea treatments  She has them spayed and neutered so they’ll stop breeding  Despised by some and misunderstood by many  Nelson and her comrades are all that stand between a city’s cat colonies and world domination  It’s hard to say for sure how many feral cats are out there  Mike Keiley  chief of cat programs for the Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals  says it’s reasonable to assume there’s one street cat for every six residents  The MSPCA estimates there are more than 10 000 feral cats in Dorchester and Roxbury alone  They are housepets  and descendants of housepets  both lightly and cruelly abandoned  It isn’t a grand humanitarian cause  taking on human suffering or world peace or the lack of parking downtown  But it is a good one  and it is Nelson’s   nAnd so there she was  working her tiny corner of the huge cat crisis in the dark on a recent  frigid morning  bent over a giant bag of dry cat food beside her idling car outside her Roslindale home  She’s usually out here at 4 a m   but she agreed to meet me a little later  since it was a holiday  and there was no need to rush to her job driving a Boston school bus  She scooped dry food into cardboard trays  mi  in giant spoonfuls of wet  and stacked the trays in the back of her red Hyundai  “This is the whole process  every darn morning ” she said  except she didn’t say darn  She held up an extra large can of food “At my age  I should be all excited about a cruise ” she said  “Now I’m excited about this  A buck a can at Stop and Shop ”She is 56 — “I’m 56  I look 96  and I feel 100 ” She’s been driving a school bus for more than 30 years  She started tending to street cats 10 years ago  when she spotted a colony on a vacant lot along her route  After a short ride in her extremely fragrant car  we stood at the lower end of that sloped lot in Dorchester  holding a few trays  “This is the one that started it all off ” she said proudly of the nondescript patch  Cats appeared from the shadows  one by one  “These are my babies  Hey  Momma  Hey  Slapper  There’s Fluffy ”Nelson estimates she has taken 176 cats off this street alone over the last 10 years  She counts only seven cats here now  When she first arrived  they were everywhere  eating from dumpsters  their ribs hanging down  She took out cats that were ill  or were friendly enough for adoption  and made sure to have others neutered so the colony wouldn’t expand  She brings the neutered cats home to her garage to recuperate before setting them free again  She has kept some over the years  She refused to say how many  though over the course of our conversations  she admitted to at least five  Nelson visits with about 100 cats altogether  spread over 10 colonies in Roxbury  Dorchester  and Roslindale  Some live in iffy locations  At one point  we went behind a building into an alley where  a few seconds later  eight cats came to greet us  Some of them seemed friendly  Some were decidedly hissy  This is the point at which I should confess that  although I live with one  I am not a cat person  I am even less of a hang around in dark alleys in neighborhoods where bad stuff has happened person  I was starting to get the feeling I’ve had over the years reporting stories in dangerous places —  I’m remembering an alley in Westerrn Pakistan after 9 11 —  that  you know  perhaps this wasn’t the smartest move  Nelson’s stories weren’t helping  “My friend Claudia and I were trapping one night and we heard ‘Pop  pop  pop ’ and she said ‘Get down ’ and I said ‘I can’t  my knees ’”“Should we chat in the car ” I offered feebly  backing out of the alley  But Nelson stayed put  talking to the cats  She did not lower her voice  She is fearless  A lot of residents don’t like her  They’re angry at her for venturing onto their properties  for feeding cats they wish would just go away  They don’t seem to realize she’s also trying to make sure those cats stop breeding  When they yell and swear at her  she yells and swears back  She’s angry  too  She knows some of the people who live near her colonies have turned cats out when they had no more use for them  Some of the cats she feeds are friendly  She takes some to the vet and finds they’re microchipped — former pets  obviously  She’ll get a colony down to five one year  and come back in the spring to find it growing exponentially again  “How can you walk out your door and ignore them ” she says  “These people are abandoning cats  I didn’t put them here  you did ”Nelson is getting tired  She has handed off a few of her colonies to her friend Fred  who got into the feral cat tending business six years ago  at Nelson’s urging  and now feeds and traps in 23 places — “Without Fred  we’re dead ” Nelson said  “I’d have to get up at 1 a m ”Trapping is hard work  and she can’t do it as often anymore  And she can’t keep pouring money into food and veterinarians’ bills   “If I ever hit the lottery  I’d build a shelter ” she said  “But it would be filled within the month  and I’d have to build another ”Sometimes she cries on the way to work  worrying about her babies  and what might happen to them when she is gone  People donate blankets and food sometimes to help her  but it’s never enough  There are just too many cats Nelson is convinced the only way to end this is to stiffen penalties for people who abandon cats  and launch a citywide education campaign  She’s probably right In the meantime  the MSPCA is coming in to take the pressure off her  at least for a little while  With a grant from PetSmart  they’re working with an army of Nelsons from  to trap and neuter at least half of the feral cats in Dorchester and Roxbury over the next year  When they’re done  they’ll return the cats to the streets they know  The animals will still want feeding  and love  And it looks like as long as she’s kicking  Nelson will be there to give it to them  It’s not like she has any choice  this is who she is As Nelson set down her last tray of food for the morning  the sky lightened and turned pink  The city awoke  The cats  their bellies full  scurried back to their hiding places  And Nelson headed home to tend to her patients  “People say ‘God bless you ’” she said  “ I don’t want God to bless me  I don’t want a special place in heaven  I want this madness to stop  I want this suffering to stop ”', '2014_396')",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"('n left the Dominican Republic for Boston over a decade ago because he believes in the American Dream  That belief remains intact  even though Suero has spent the past three and a half years in court  fighting government lawyers who are trying to kick Suero’s family out of their Dorchester home  Suero bought his tiny slice of Upham’s Corner a decade ago  but whether he gets to keep it largely hinges on two questions  whether state laws aimed at bringing Wall Street’s worst actors to heel can also protect Massachusetts residents from their own government  and whether government controlled mortgage businesses are in business to save money  or exact revenge on foreclosed families Suero is the kind of borrower that subprime mortgage lenders got paid to exploit during the housing boom  In 2005  the notorious subprime lender Option One gave Suero a no money down mortgage with an exploding interest rate — the kind of mortgage that brought down the entire economy  The loan allowed Suero  who was working two full time hotel jobs  to buy a condo in an Upham’s Corner triple decker  Massachusetts later sued Option One  alleging that the firm illegally steered high risk loans to non native English speakers and poor communities of color  the company paid a $10 million settlement   nSuero refinanced into a vanilla loan that wound up in the hands of Freddie Mac  the nationalized mortgage investor  He fell behind on his loan due to a family illness  and  he and the local hotel workers union say  because he was fired for union organizing  Freddie foreclosed in late 2010  Suero has been fighting to get his home back ever since  The fight has taken Suero from the Boston Housing Court to the federal courthouse on Fan Pier  An eviction battle has morphed into a tug of war over whether the federal government can exempt itself from Massachusetts’s consumer protection laws  Boston Community Capital  a local nonprofit  runs a loan fund that works with foreclosed families  It buys foreclosed homes and sells them back to their former owners  stabilizing families and neighborhoods in the process  Boston Community Capital has cleared Suero to borrow the money he needs to buy his Upham’s Corner home back  The problem is  Freddie Mac refuses to sell to Suero and Boston Community Capital  or anyone like them  Freddie Mac and its larger corporate sibling  Fannie Mae  won’t sell foreclosed homes back to their former owners unless they receive the full value of the foreclosed mortgage — sums that are normally well above what the properties are worth now  Fannie and Freddie will charge market prices to any other buyer of a foreclosed home  But to those properties’ former owners  they charge a foreclosure premium  This premium all but assures that foreclosed homeowners won’t stay in their homes  Foreclosure is a costly proposition for any bank  but Fannie and Freddie are picking and choosing whom they’re willing to lose money to  This policy is not something any large commercial bank subscribes to  Fannie and Freddie also refuse to sell to nonprofits like Boston Community Capital that work with foreclosed homeowners  So when Boston Community Capital put in repeated offers to buy Suero’s home out of foreclosure  they went unanswered  A 2012 Massachusetts law makes it illegal for any lender to put stipulations on a sale to a nonprofit  The law was aimed at lenders who refuse to do business with firms that work with foreclosed homeowners  and Fannie and Freddie are by far the biggest offenders  Suero sued Freddie last fall for violating this law  Freddie’s lawyers have already made noises about claiming that  since they’ve been federalized  they’re immune from the state law  Last summer  lawyers representing Fannie and Freddie successfully maneuvered out of a Chicago ordinance requiring them to register  and pay fees on  vacant foreclosed properties  So there’s clearly a chance that the Massachusetts law might fall to the same arguments about federal powers that knocked down Chicago’s foreclosure efforts  The bigger question is what Freddie Mac actually gains by sinking untold sums of money into a years long legal battle to wrest an Upham’s Corner condo from a family that wants nothing more than to see Freddie get paid and walk away', '2014_194')",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

actually its twin that was first painted with six splashes of color in 1971 by former nun turned graphic artist Corita Kent  who was commissioned by a Boston Gas executive “It seemed a neat thing to do with the tank’s oval form ” she said at the time  “To me it represents hope  uplifting  and spring  It’s a joyous expression  joining heaven and earth together ”It was the world’s largest

leader Ho Chi Minh in the blue stripe  t nStill  when the original “rainbow tank ” as many called it  was demolished in the early 1990s  its splashes had become iconic to many  and Boston Gas officials had Kent’s artwork duplicated on the second container a few years later  That white tank’s only previous decoration was the Boston Gas logo — one word green  one blue  topped by a flame That insignia was covered sometime after Keyspan Corp  agreed to purchase the parent company of Boston Gas in November 1999  National Grid’s decal went up in 2007  when the British utility acquired Keyspan “For this paint job ” National Grid spokesman Jake Navarro said  “we decided to remove the decals and paint over the old logo completely  then add our National Grid logo  We are proud to maintain this New England landmark ”In the next few weeks  up to eight workers will pressure wash the tank and refresh the white parts  painting over the Boston Gas logo and restoring the National Grid name  The six splashes  meanwhile  will be treated and coated with a clear layer  The job is expected to take about six weeks and will keep the tank looking fresh for the next two decades Meanwhile  Taylor  the local historian  said as long as Kent’s painting stays on the tank  he doesn’t really care which utility logo the container bears “We used to pay Boston Gas and now we pay someone else ” he said

for seniors programing  public health centers  and services for veterans  youth  and immigrants  “My concern is that seniors not be forgotten by the Walsh administration ” said Clara Garcia  director of senior services at United South End Settlements  “Our seniors  sometimes even more than the rest of us  are facing very difficult times right now ”Mayor Martin J  Walsh did not attended the forum  but made an appearance minutes after it concluded  emerging from his black SUV in Roslindale wearing a hooded sweatshirt and work boots to help work on a Habitat for Humanity building project  Walsh spent the first Saturday afternoon of his mayoral tenure hammering nails and planning to watch his beloved Patriots as his administration continued its transition into power  As he has for almost every game day for nearly two decades  Walsh was set to make the trek to Foxborough to watch the Pats take on the Indianapolis Colts  “This year I haven’t gone to any games ” Walsh said during the afternoon building session  eagerly anticipating attending his first football game of the season  “So I’m looking forward to getting to my seats ”The day capped a busy first week in office for Walsh

day erecting the side wall of one of the home’s roofs  As the new mayor got down on his hands and knees to hammer in nails on some of the support beams  the spotlight he was under was pointed out “You’re 30 percent more likely to bend a nail if someone is watching ” Gerry Patten  Habitat for Humanity construction coordinator  teased Walsh  as the mayor hammered away  “Probably 70 percent more

lives in Dorchester and is the mother of three young children  As of this month  she is also a new unit coordinator on a labor and delivery floor at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston  Her first paychecks arrived in time for Christmas  t n“I felt so happy ” Colon said  “I was even more happy to tell my children  I had told them  ‘Pray that your mom gets a good job ’ u2009”This is not a story about someone who had been chronically unemployed finally landing a job  Colon had worked in a series of contract office positions  which by definition all came to an end before long  More recently  she worked for a big shoe store in downtown Boston  the kind of retail position that does not come with much in the way of security Colon left the shoe store behind in October to enter a job development program run by something called Partners in Careers and Workforce Development  which is part of Partners HealthCare  She was one of 20 people who spent eight weeks — some of them in a classroom and others working at brief internships — before applying for permanent jobs She landed almost immediately at the Brigham  She got a job that comes with more money  benefits  sick leave  and training opportunities — in other words  a future Colon and her new position make up one tiny data point in a big economic picture that shows employment improving across America  By year’s end  the country will have added nearly 3 million new jobs  The US unemployment rate  which peaked at 10 percent  is down to 5 8 percent and falling Just as importantly  the quality of new positions is generally improving  For years  after the economy hit rock bottom in 2009  new jobs commonly meant low wages  negligible benefits  and zero employment security Conditions are better — not great — now “The job gains are strong by almost any historical standard ” said Mark Zandi  the chief economist at Moody’s Analytics  “The quality of jobs is improving  Growth is across the board between low   high   and middle paying jobs ”Of course  the US economy has a lot more ground to make up  Millions of people are looking for that elusive good job  Wage growth for American workers still leaves a lot to be desired  The ranks of “involuntary part time workers” — people who want full time jobs but can’t find them — remain historically high at 7 million But the economy is also creating new jobs at its fastest pace since the tech boom of the late 1990s  Among all the statistics in the government’s economic reports  lots of people like Colon are taking a step up Colon’s new job certainly won’t make her rich  She’s getting paid a base rate of $14 65 an hour but makes a little more — and gets free parking — for working the overnight shift on her floor She can take vacation time or sick days and still get paid  That’s not the way it worked in many of her other jobs “It’s a luxury just be able to get paid for days like that ” she said Even more importantly  there are training programs and other opportunities to move up in the future  Colon has already signed up for courses that could help her get a better position as a kind of surgical assistant known as a “scrub tech ” That’s a 16 month program  She is thinking two years ahead These are things good jobs can  hopefully  give more Americans in the year ahead — a real paycheck and a chance at a better future  They changed Colon’s life in a matter of weeks “I feel like I can finally look forward to Christmas ” she said  “For the first time  I didn’t have to seek help or feel stressed out about having nothing  I was able to act like Santa for the first time in a long time ”Nyviana Colon is grateful for it all  She got her gift a little early this year', '2014_1101')",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
147,,,,,,,,,"('A gas explosion in a Dorchester home last week has renewed focus on the state’s aging natural gas pipelines  which not only pose threats to public safety  but also cost customers millions of dollars because they still are charged for fuel lost to leaks Legislation is moving through both Congress and the state Legislature to speed repair and replacement of gas pipelines  Some in Massachusetts are more than 150 years old  n nMassachusetts utilities respond to tens of thousands of calls about potential gas leaks each year  and reported more than 25 000 leaks to utility regulators at the end of September  Last week’s explosion  which followed a call from someone who smelled gas  critically injured two elderly people and hurt nine others on Hansborough Street  nUS Senator Edward J  Markey  who called the explosion “just the latest scary reminder” of the threat of gas leaks  has proposed two bills that could help address the problem The first bill requires utilities speed up the repair or replacement of the leakiest pipes and asks state regulators to consider adopting policies that prioritize repairs based on the severity of a leak  The bill would also speed the process under which utilities can recover the cost of that work from the rates customers pay Markey’s second bill would establish a revolving loan fund to help finance pipeline repairs in states  States would need to match 20 percent of the federal funds they received under the program  nUS consumers have paid some $20 billion during the last decade for natural gas they never received because of leaks  according to a study released by Markey’s office last year  In addition  the main component of natural gas is methane  a powerful greenhouse gas that has a greater impact on climate change than carbon dioxide  n“The unseen patchwork of aging natural gas pipelines in our country threatens public safety  takes money out of the pockets of consumers who pay for gas they never receive  and releases emissions that worsen climate change ” Markey said in a statement  nIn Massachusetts  the state Senate recently passed legislation that sets standards for classifying the severity leaks  as well as a timeline for repairing them  The bill includes language giving priority to leaks near places of public assembly  such as churches  hospitals  and schools The legislation would also require utilities to make repairs when unrelated road construction projects expose a pipeline  That is not mandated now A similar bill also has passed the state House of Representatives  Negotiators from each house will hash out the differences to craft a compromise bill State Representative Lori Ehrlich  a Marblehead Democrat who has been working for the past five years to get a leak repair bill passed  said there appears to be “quite a bit” of support for the legislation  and accidents like last week’s explosion put a spotlight on the problem “I don’t want to presuppose what happened in Dorchester ” Ehrlich said  “but it is a good reminder that what is traveling beneath our feet is explosive and time is of the essence in taking care of this issue ”Investigators are still trying to determine the source of the gas responsible for the explosion April 16  Boston Fire Department spokesman Steve MacDonald said Friday National Grid utility workers were investigating a report of a gas leak when the explosion ripped through the home on Hansborough Street  The utility said it does not believe its pipes were the problem “We have not found any issues with our infrastructure  and it appears to have been operating normally ” the company said in a statement', '2014_558')",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"('n n nNATICK — Businesses along Main

Espresso Bar and Cafe said they saw triple the revenue from the event than a normal weekday  “We’ve been here for 17 years ” said Java’s Cafe manager James Shapiro  “and there have been more people here for this Marathon than there has been for a while ” nAs afternoon temperatures rose into the 60s  runners thinned out along the course in Natick  as did the crowd that had clogged the sidewalks of Route 135 for hours during the morning  That didn’t stop Kate Sullivan of Natick  clad in an electric blue Boston Strong shirt  from whole heartedly cheering on runners from the sidelines “I come every year  but it was particularly important to come this year ” she said as she continued clapping for straggling runners  “It was absolutely devastating last year  that anyone would take advantage of such a great event like that ”Sullivan said she felt safe at this year’s race  given the 2013 events  and pointed out that she saw more spectators in Natick than in previous years “I only hope there’s as much support from people every year ” she said   nAs the last Marathon competitors brought up the race’s rear just after 2 p m   volunteers began raking and shoveling hundreds of discarded

Abby Kanyer  22  a chemistry major from Milwaukee  waved a sign reading  “Kiss Me if You  heart  Beer ”Several runners planted kisses right on her lips “Guys love beer ” Kanyer said with a laugh She insisted the runners were responding to her crafty message  and not her spaghetti strap camisole  “I had a sweater over it  but it got hot ” said Kanyer  an aspiring brewer All the screaming and kissing is a time honored tradition at Wellesley  known for educating smart  strong women  Kanyer thinks the tragedy at last year’s marathon drew more students out to cheer this year “I feel like the students really rallied to get out here today ” she said Earlier  as they leaned over metal barricades  Wellesley students rang tiny cowbells and shouted into small blue megaphones bearing a “W ” They waved signs  and cheered for motorcycle cops and State Police vans patrolling the route But the loudest cheers came when the first elite women runners passed by after 10 a m  They drew appreciative smiles and a few handslaps from runners “Go  ladies ” one male spectator shouted As the elite male runners arrived at 11 a m  the screams and bells grew louder and longer  There were plenty of kisses

the children An avid runner who has run the Marathon several times  Green last ran alongside wife Cindy Green in 1996 Cindy Green began to tear up as she explained that the family lives in Pittsburgh

year after the bombings  The area was quiet and desolate  Fear loomed  But not this year  Washington Square thumps with people “I love this ” she said  “The energy is perfect ”The crowds had gone ballistic as the female elite runners started going by around 11 35  They shook their cowbells even harder and screamed louder under a warm sky Sisters Christine and Mary Ellen Laura of West Roxbury held a blue sign made for their niece Laura Wiatt  They planned to wave it when she passed  It had leopard print duct tape and three cut out hearts  One was red After last years’s bombing  Wiatt was inspired to run  her aunt said Just then a pack of servicemembers ran by  One was lagging and walking “Come on  sergeant ” yelled Doug Mitchell of Newton Mitchell ran Saturday with a band of military members called Tough Ruck  who run with heavy backpacks  They used to run in the marathon but couldn’t do it this year because of the stricter rules When he saw the soldier lagging  Mitchell’s voice rose again “It’s important to me because it was something I can do ” he said  “I want them to know they are remembered  And we still care ”The elite male runners seemed to sprint by  The crowd roared with each passing athlete “Such a sight to behold  “ Christine Laura said  “The smells  the sight  the scenery  It’s a sign the city is coming together ”— MEGHAN E  IRONS      NEAR THE FINISH LINE —

year when she returned to the spot where she was stopped and made her way to Boylston Street “I couldn’t believe how close I was ” she said  wearing last year’s blue and gold Marathon jacket The 2013 race was her fifth  This year was supposed to be her sixth  but a pelvis fracture kept her from running  “I was almost through all the long runs when it happened ” she said of her fracture  which

Massachusetts  Attorney General Martha Coakley got some high powered backing Friday from Michelle Obama  who wooed supporters at a Dorchester landmark and urged them to vote in droves this November The White House treatment is meant to infuse life into Coakley’s campaign  An aide to Hillary Clinton said the former secretary of state will also campaign for Coakley  But the aide did not provide details about the visit  t nAddressing a packed crowd at the Strand Theatre in Uphams Corner  Obama noted Coakley’s record advocating for victims of violence  including women and children  Obama said Coakley fought to guarantee safe access to reproductive health care  a higher minimum wage  and earned sick time for working families “She believes that no one should ever have to choose between keeping their job and taking care of their sick child ’’ Obama said  “If you want a governor who will stand up to powerful interests  if you want a governor who is truly on your side  then you need to elect Martha ”Essentially tied with GOP rival Charlie Baker in the polls but trailing him in fund raising  Coakley — paired on the Democratic ticket with lieutenant governor candidate Steve Kerrigan — is hoping to persuade true believers that a big turnout at the polls is pivotal Baker’s camp shrugged off the high profile visits of Obama and Clinton “Charlie hopes the first lady and Secretary Clinton enjoy their visit to our beautiful Commonwealth  and he is proud to have earned the backing of prominent Democrats from right here in Massachusetts where it counts ’’ said Tim Buckley  a Baker spokesman In the past two days  Coakley has tried to inject vitality into what some have said is a lackluster campaign  On Thursday  she lashed out at a television ad by backers of Baker that accused her of not doing enough to protect children She demanded that Baker disavow what she called a “deceitful and disgusting’’ ad  but he has refused “If he thinks that I will stand by and allow him to lie about my record       then he’s wrong ” Coakley said  “He doesn’t know me  He doesn’t know the people ”Sandwiched between some powerhouse speakers — including Councilor at Large Ayanna Pressley  Senator Edward J  Markey  Governor Deval Patrick  and Obama — Coakley struggled to keep enthusiasm high among the audience The crowd at one point seemed to buoy the candidate  chanting Martha  then Coakley  nA telling moment came at the end of the event  as hundreds of eager supporters stood up and applauded  Coakley  who had left the stage  reappeared and hugged Obama  holding her hand and waving  The two women walked to a far corner of the stage  but as Obama lingered to soak up the cheers  Coakley tugged at her hand  appearing to attempt to walk off The first lady tugged back at Coakley’s hand  holding her in place  The two women paused for a brief moment before walking off for good  with the attorney general leading Obama’s visit to Boston on her 22d wedding anniversary appeared to be an attempt to bring warmth and personal appeal in Coakley’s bid for governor  Speaker after speaker also tried to fire up the Democratic base Kerrigan urged Baker and the Republicans to “bring it on” in November  while Markey conveyed a sense of urgency “This is the beginning of a sprint to the end of the race  and we need your help ’’ Markey said In a rousing speech  Pressley told the crowd that Coakley has always supported her efforts for victims and struggling families “This isn’t about rhetoric  it’s about a record ’’ Pressley said Mayor Martin J  Walsh  fresh from his trip to Ireland  publicly endorsed Coakley and Kerrigan for the first time  saying Boston needs strong allies at the state level “That’s why this election matters for the city and the state that I love ’’ he said During her speech  Coakley said she has spent the past year campaigning across the state and is impressed by the optimism of residents  She pledged to build on the work that Patrick has done to help bolster local economies Afterward  Greg Hull  a Springfield minister  said he met Coakley when she visited his church last week  and came to Boston to show his support  She helped him get a ticket to see Obama  he said Outdoors at a corner in Uphams Corner  Lillian O’Neal  a 75 year old retired Postal Service supervisor  said she was awed by Obama’s speech “I hope it was moving enough to

151,,,,,,,,,"('City Council president Bill Linehan  scaling back his initial bid for a raise this year  said Monday that council members should follow the advice of the state Ethics Commission and wait until January 2016 to add the increase to their paychecks The council  facing scrutiny over the propriety of the raise  is expected to vote Wednesday on the $25 000 yearly increase  according to Councilor at Large Michael R  Flaherty Jr   chairman of the Government Operations Committee  which had been reviewing the matter and held a public hearing last week  n t nThe 29 percent raise would boost councilors’ pay to $112 500  If the increase goes into effect in 2016  a decade will have passed since the council’s last raise  Linehan said Mayor Martin J  Walsh has to approve the raise  A spokeswoman said Monday evening that the mayor had not seen the revised proposal  n“If and when there is a proposal before the mayor  he and his team will review accordingly ” spokeswoman Kate Norton said The law stipulates that any wage increase must take effect after the next council election  In Boston’s case  that would be after January 2016 Linehan said he wanted to address how the City Council should handle its own pay  The council has long voted on its raises  but this year the state Ethics Commission objected A state ethics law forbids municipal employees from participating in matters that serve their own interest  including pay raises “We still feel that there is a conflict between the state law that empowers us to create an ordinance to adjust our salaries — up or down — and state ethics law ” said Linehan  of South Boston  “Moving forward  we would like to resolve that ”Linehan had proposed amending the city ordinance to include the higher salary of $112 500  up from $87 500  and to have it go into effect immediately  Under the revised plan  the raise would be deferred until 2016 The revised measure appears poised to pass  according to several councilors  Still  some councilors said they are advocating for a lower pay increase and a different mechanism for adjusting councilors’ salaries Councilor Frank Baker  who represents Dorchester  has been a vocal champion of a raise and has said he will continue to support it  in spite of the delay in implementation But Councilor Josh Zakim of Mission Hill said that after just nine months on the council  he cannot justify giving himself a raise and will oppose the measure Councilor Matt O’Malley of West Roxbury and Councilor at Large Ayanna Pressley of Dorchester have argued that Linehan’s pay hike is too much  Both are pressing for a lower increase  along with Councilor Salvatore LaMattina “I’ve been clear all along that I think the number is too high and we should lower it ’’ said O’Malley  who is urging the council to adopt a salary setting mechanism used by state lawmakers that relies on changes in median income in the state Saying that taxpayers deserve an open and predictable process  Pressley said if the measure comes up for a vote Wednesday  she will oppose it “There needs to be a mechanism to protect taxpayers and to pay our salaries ’’ she said Pressley said she would support using a 2013 report by the city’s Compensation Advisory Board as a basis for increasing councilor’s pay  At the time  the board had recommended an 8 6 percent pay hike for the mayor — bringing the chief executive’s salary to about $190 000 — but none for councilors  The recommendation was not acted upon Traditionally  councilors are paid half of what the mayor makes  and the council should follow that practice  Pressley said The fiscal watchdog Boston Municipal Research Bureau also suggested at the hearing last week that the Compensation Advisory Board report could be used to set a salary increase Samuel R  Tyler  bureau president  said Walsh and the council should work together to resolve lingering issues “Our position is that this should not be done piecemeal ’’ Tyler said  “This requires the mayor and the City Council to come to an arrangement on how to proceed  and I don’t think that has been done yet ”As the vote nears  Councilor at Large Michelle Wu and  nZakim

basketball standout Jake O’Brien’s spirits soared  The native of Weymouth snapped an aerial photo of Boston  and then tweeted  “Never looked so good ”O’Brien  24  was returning home early from a rocky rookie season playing professional basketball in violence torn Ukraine  nThe 6 foot 9 inch power forward spent the last six months playing for Ferro ZNTU Zaporozhye  a team in the Ukrainian Superleague  He planned on returning home in May  but the turmoil in the country prompted an early exit Although O’Brien visited both Kiev and Crimea  he was never close to the bloodshed there  he said   nBut even his host city of Zaporozhye  a gritty  Russian speaking industrial city in southeastern Ukraine  was affected In late January  police used tear gas and stun grenades against demonstrators there who were trying to capture a regional administration building  A local synagogue was also targeted with Molotov cocktails in February  according to news reports  The entire basketball league was shut down for nearly three weeks in February  O’Brien  one of four Americans on the team  was warned by the team manager to stay inside on several occasions as violence escalated “I wasn’t too scared ” he said  “I’m old enough to know how to stay away from trouble  Our team was good about keeping us in the loop  Our team manager said  ‘Do what you do during the day  but don’t leave your apartment at night ’ ”One evening  O’Brien shot video of a pro Ukrainian rally right from his apartment window overlooking Lenin Street  He was wise to use the high post location  The team photographer was attacked while photographing another demonstration on the Zaporozhye streets “The manager told me they broke his hand  they fractured his skull  they beat him up pretty bad ” said O’Brien In early March  with the situation deteriorating and many American ballplayers already gone  O’Brien received permission to leave from the team’s general manager “Enough is enough ” he said of his rookie experience   n nO’Brien has had a year of highs and lows  Last March  he was swishing 3 pointers in the NCAA Tournament  then in June  he had a predraft workout for the Celtics   nLast week  O’Brien was snaking down back roads in the middle of the night to the airport in Donetsk  just 45 miles from the Russian border “Our driver had to avoid the highways to avoid being stopped by  presumed  Russian troops ” he said  “Took us a while to get there  I saw a few soldiers on the way  That’s when it got kind of scary and a relief when we got to the airport “I was happy to get out of there  I learned how great we have it here in America ”O’Brien was having a good rookie season  As the starting power forward  he was averaging 10 8 points and 6 2 rebounds per game in 25 minutes  The team’s green away uniforms looked a little like Celtics jerseys  but O’Brien never thought about that  even though he is Boston through and through His great grandfather  Buck O’Brien  was the starting pitcher for the first game ever played at Fenway Park on April 20  1912  He went on to win 20 games for the Red Sox that year  O’Brien’s uncle Joe was an ace pitcher and starting quarterback at Boston College  he graduated in 1978 and is in the BC Varsity Club Hall of Fame Jake’s dream was to play in the NCAA Tournament and then the NBA  He started young  Mark Jaehnig  program director of the North Quincy Sacred Heart League  taught him fundamentals in Grades 1 5  “Jake was very thin  kind of timid  but always had good skills ” said Jaehnig  “He could shoot  Jake was just a real quiet kid but he worked at his game  He’s more a finesse player than a  Jared  Sullinger type ” During a Sacred Heart League banquet last year  Jaehnig heard the unmistakable sound of a ball bouncing upstairs in the gym  It was O’Brien  who had gotten a key and was working on his game “I asked him if he’d talk to the kids  and he did ” said Jaehnig  nAt BC High  O’Brien was a Catholic Conference all star when the Eagles won their first  state championship in his junior year  At BU  he was America East Rookie of the Year as a freshman  The future was bright  By his junior year  2010 11   he was leading the team in rebounding  5 8   and was second in blocks  14  and third in scoring  11 6 ppg  through 14 games But during a game against UMass on Dec  31  2010  he drove baseline  pulled up for a jump shot  got fouled  and landed awkwardly on the defender’s foot  He shot the two free throws but missed the next year and a half  needing two operations for a fracture of the navicular bone in his foot  “the same surgery had by Tom Brady and Dustin Pedroia ” he said  He watched BU play in the Big Dance while on crutches O’Brien red shirted the 2011 12 season and then transferred to Temple with the coaches’ blessings when BU became temporarily ineligible for the NCAA Tournament for switching leagues  from America East to the Patriot League   At Temple  his dream of playing in the Big Dance came true  On March 22  2013  in a second round victory over North Carolina State  he scored 18 points on 7 for 9 shooting  including four 3 pointers  in 32 minutes “It was incredible ” he said  “To advance  that’s what you play for  All the injuries  all the setbacks to get back  to have it all together that one day was a great feeling ”Temple lost in the next round  but O’Brien had been noticed  Danny Ainge  the Celtics president of basketball operations  had kind words for him after the June workout  “He said  ‘Great work  you shot it very well ’ ” said O’Brien But the phone never rang on draft day “I wasn’t surprised ” said O’Brien  “There’s just so many guys on the bubble of the NBA ”So he signed with Ferro ZNTU for more money than most people make in his hometown of Weymouth He had never left the US  never been west of the Mississippi before  But he reported to camp in late August  nZaporozhye will never be mistaken for the Hub  The architecture is old Soviet concrete blocks  Lenin’s statue still stands  despite Ukraine’s independence  Culture shock set in for O’Brien “It’s an old city ” he said  “When you go there  you think it’s 40 years ago  back in time  The buildings are all broken down ”Travel was by bus only — sometimes for nine hours — and the roads were bad “I just tried to take it in stride and learn what life is like over there ” said O’Brien  “People have the same interests in movies and clothes ”The basketball was similar  but by February  the violence was creeping into his world “They kept canceling games  and we were left not knowing what was going next ” he said He spent some nights cooped up in his apartment on Lenin Avenue “I was homesick a little  but luckily I had Skype  Facetime  and a good Internet connection with friends and family back home ” he said  “I lived on my computer there ”But he was a long way from Commonwealth Avenue Food was a problem  There were no sandwiches or subs  according to O’Brien  and just one subpar American style restaurant  So he grilled chicken in his apartment night after night — the Ukrainian Wade Boggs  The other American players stuck together  but they were scattered around the city  LaRon Dendy  a former Sun Belt Conference Player of the Year  had his fiancée and 5 year old son with him “There were definitely nights when I sat by myself and wondered  ‘What am I doing out here ’ ” said O’Brien “Basketball is my life  It’s given me so much  It hasn’t been the smoothest ride  But I’m over here playing the sport I love ”He’d give himself pep talks “It’s OK ” he’d tell himself  “You get paid to play basketball  This is what you always wanted to do  How upset can you really get about it ” nSome scenes were jolting “When the  expletive  really started hitting the fan  there were lines at all the ATM machines ” said O’Brien  “Everybody was taking money out of banks  Everywhere in the whole country ”The uncertainty was stressful “We were nervous they would cancel the league altogether ” said O’Brien  “You just didn’t feel safe there ”On arrival at Logan Airport  O’Brien didn’t kiss the ground  but he did stop at a Dunkin’ Donuts in the terminal and wolfed down a bacon egg and cheese sandwich with coffee He is looking to hook on with another team  and spends his days working out  “I’m not going to get a 9 to 5 job   he said  “I’m going to keep working on my game to get better ”The interview is cut short when a text message comes in about a pickup game in Dorchester that night Meanwhile  his agent is working the phones  O’Brien doesn’t know where he’ll end up  He’s not ready to abandon his long shot NBA dream  either  Told that Celtics Vitor Faverani and Gerald Wallace are both out for the season with injuries  he gets excited “I

there are  there’s no way to determine whether the hearsay is reliable ” Garsh said regarding the calls Prosecutors  last week seeking the recordings and logs  alleging in court papers that during the

and dreamed bigger  carving faces out of 7 ton boulders  turning scraggly pine trees into towering sculptures fit for a Tim Burton movie  even trying to replace the crumbled Old Man of the Mountain  But the 65 year old Dorchester artist’s latest plan is by far his most outlandish and ambitious Wheelwright  whose sculptures have exhibited along the East Coast  from Miami to Washington to New York  Boston  and Vermont  wants to carve a giant head into the majestic Andes mountains of Peru  It’s a project that could take a decade to finish and cost millions  but which he boasts could be the “eighth wonder of the world ”As proof of how serious he is  he is in Cusco now talking with Peruvian business leaders and government officials in hope of raising money — and getting permission — to create a piece he believes could draw comparisons to Stonehenge and the Great Pyramid of Giza Those familiar with Wheelwright’s work and unyielding personality say the idea is just crazy enough to come together  but there are some who say he has no business carving into the side of a beautiful mountain for the sake of art “I don’t question his ability to pull it off ” said Fitchburg Art Museum director Nick Capasso  who commissioned  from Wheelwright while curator at the Decordova Sculpture Park and Museum in Lincoln  “He’s certainly worked in very large scales ”Wheelwright knows the challenges he will face  But he is hoping to make the case that his piece would be perfect for the Andes mountains  serving as both inspiration and tourist attraction in Southeastern Peru  The region  in part because of the 15th century Incan village Machu Picchu  already draws more than 2 million visitors a year “In America  I think you couldn’t accomplish this ” Wheelwright  a wiry figure who uses his hands both when he’s working and talking  “There’d be a counterforce that would smite it  But in Peru  mining is huge and a huge tourist industry and a huge labor force and there are good workers  It would be ideal  The world is ready for an eighth wonder of the world ”His supporters say what separates Wheelwright from other artists is his willingness to take on bold  groundbreaking projects   n“One of the things we learn in art is that you won’t learn anything if you don’t take risks ” said Murray Dewart  a sculptor with works in the Museum of Fine Arts and Harvard Art Museums  “I’m a great believer in taking risks and a great believer in Joe’s work ”  nEven Doonesbury creator Garry Trudeau said he was not surprised to hear his longtime friend and former roommate at Yale University proposing such an oversized idea “I hate to think of him running out the clock chipping away at a remote peak in the Andes  but for a certain kind of artist  it doesn’t get any better ” Trudeau said in an e mail The mountain sculpture idea is actually rooted in an earlier Wheelwright proposal  In 2003  disappointed by the collapse of the rock formation in New Hampshire known as The Old Man of the Mountain  the sculptor proposed a potential replacement  He carved a man’s head out of a 17 inch tall chunk of granite  to show state officials what it would look like  He was not surprised that he never heard back — a full sized version of the head would have been very costly  but he keeps the model on a table in the center of his studio Then  earlier this year  he and sculptor  developed a project with a group of Peruvian sculptors  Wheelwright and other members of the Boston Sculptors Gallery will show their work starting in February in the Qorikancha Museum in Machu Picchu  A group of Peruvians artists will show their work in Boston next year  The Peru exchange gave Wheelwright the idea for reviving his Old Man of the Mountain proposal  The idea came as he was also coping with his biggest  professional failure In late 2012  he had attempted to raise a 35 foot sculpture made out of a pine tree in the woods of Vermont  The piece  constructed on the ground  would have been his tallest yet  But as Wheelwright and a group watched his assistant scale the tree during installation   The assistant ended up in the hospital with broken bones in his arm and face  Wheelwright found himself in a fog  He felt shaky and exhausted “I think that was really a nightmare come true ” said Tess Wheelwright  his daughter  “He has always lived on the line between crazy and visionary  He’s had a magic touch there and been able to make a life just doing what he wants to do  The fact that the Gods betrayed him that day  I think it really shook him ”  nThe mountain idea  she said  has given Wheelwright back “that old sparkle in his eyes ”It is also become a topic of some debate  Trudeau urged Wheelwright to keep the idea to himself at this early stage  He worries that too much publicity might alienate the Peruvians Marco Troiano Bocanegra  Wheelwright’s main contact in Peru  also suggested waiting before going public  Bocanegra has been setting up meetings in advance of Wheelwright’s Dec  29 trip  In an e mail  he declined to share the names of the officials on the artist’s schedule Wheelwright’s uncle Peter Matthiessen  the famed writer and naturalist  told the sculptor over the phone that he did not like the idea of his cutting into the mountains  In an interview  Matthiessen related the idea to his feelings about Mt  Rushmore  “I’m impressed by the amount of work that went into it but I just hate the idea of it ” he said  “Joe’s thing isn’t anything like that  but the mountain is doing all right by itself ”  nWheelwright appreciates the debate  though he believes the carved head will not overwhelm the landscape  it will complement it  He’s also not sure whether talking now will help or hurt his chances  He believes the nature of the idea should win over the Peruvians “What is art  It’s the elevation of the human spirit and joy of the aesthetic ” he said  while taking a break from working in his cavernous studio on Humphreys Street “That’s what we have to sell to the nation of Peru  That this is a fabulous  natural  fun move that in the long run is going to be profitable  too ”Wheelright insists that he’s not dead set on carving the mountain  He will let it go if he encounters resistance  His daughter isn’t so sure “I don’t believe him ” she said  “When he gets a vision  it’s hard to turn him off ”',

health problem that played a role in the 2013 murder of Odin L  Lloyd In papers filed in Bristol Superior Court  Hernandez’s attorneys also notified Superior Court Judge E  Susan Garsh that they would prefer to start Hernandez’s first degree murder trial on Oct  6  but also said that realistically they would not be ready by then  t n“Hernandez has a constitutional right to a speedy trial and  as previously stated  he wants his trial to proceed as soon as possible ’’ the defense wrote  “However  a considerable amount of defense pretrial preparation remains to be done  and defense counsel cannot guarantee at this juncture that it will all be completed’ by Oct  6  Instead  the defense wrote  they could be ready to start the trial on Jan  5 provided that Bristol County District Attorney C  Samuel Sutter’s office agrees with their schedule  which sets a number of deadlines for both sides to file motions and to participate in hearings on those matters If they decide to use a mental health defense  the lawyers said  they would adhere to a self imposed deadline of Sept  30 to disclose to prosecutors the evidence they would use to make their case The pretrial disclosure of the defense strategy is required by court rule  It is designed to give prosecutors time to investigate the issue themselves before trial begins At a July 9 hearing  Michael Fee  a lawyer for Hernandez  said the defense needed psychological  medical  and other records from the Patriots because of the insight they might provide into the former athlete’s state of mind  “State of mind is critical  and it’s the basis of this request ” Fee said in court  t nThe defense also said they would notify prosecutors whether they plan to use an alibi defense or “other special defense ”   Under court rules  the defense must provide the names of any expert witnesses they plan to call  whether the issue they will discuss will focus on the defendant’s state of mind at the time of the crime  or some other specific time  They must also say whether they will use statements from the defendant to back up the expert’s conclusions Hernandez has pleaded not guilty to murdering Lloyd  a Dorchester man  on June 17  2013 in an industrial park in North Attleborough  Two of his friends  Earnest Wallace and Carlos Ortiz  are also charged with first degree murder in the case and both have pleaded not guilty

also urged Garsh to bar Sutter’s office from using information they may have gleaned from several cellphones seized from Hernandez’s home at 22 Ronald C  Meyer Drive in North Attleborough during a search after Lloyd’s slaying The defense said in court papers that a State Police detective was authorized under a search warrant to seize a specific cellphone belonging to Hernandez  but instead seized others discovered inside the sprawling home on June 18 Police “invaded the Hernandez home  rummaged through it  and seized every cell phone  even though they had only sought and obtained permission to seize a single  specified cell phone ’’ Hernandez’s attorneys wrote “The warrant authorized seizure of one cell phone  and they seized two other cell phones ” the attorneys wrote  “That seizure was simply not supported by the warrant  or by probable cause  and all fruits of that unlawful seizure must be suppressed ’’Earlier this week  Garsh ruled that prosecutors will be able to

barely scraping by  Arline  42  makes a little more than $10 an hour managing the liquor department at the Walgreens in Downtown Crossing  Ashley  19  makes $8 an hour  plus a few dollars a day in tips  at Dunkin’ Donuts in Dorchester  The mother and daughter  who share a two bedroom  rent subsidized apartment and get free health insurance from the state  sometimes subsist on ramen noodles and protein shakes when the grocery money runs out  nThe new minimum wage law enacted Thursday — pushing the hourly rate in Massachusetts from $8 to $11 dollars over the next few years — gives the state the highest base pay in the nation  But while it will help workers such as the Urquharts  it is still not considered enough for an individual to live on   nIn Massachusetts  the hourly rate a full time worker needs to pay for food  housing  transportation  and other regular expenses is at least $11 31 an hour  according to the developed by an MIT professor  In Boston and Braintree  where the Urquharts live  it’s $12 65 an hour  The pay raise Arline and Ashley Urquhart will get from the new law means they’ll be able to afford fresh fruit and lower fat hamburger meat  They might be able to buy a real couch to replace the blanket covered bench in the living room that serves as a sofa now  They won’t worry as much about the 10 cent increase in bus fare  Ashley could buy a decent pair of shoes  Arline would have the $30 she needs to apply to Quincy College  In other words  a higher minimum wage will make their lives a little more stable  a little less stressful  But not necessarily comfortable  “It’s still not enough to survive ” said Arline  who pops ibuprofen to relieve the back pain she said is caused by lifting heavy liquor boxes at Walgreens  where she recently had to decrease her hours  “A couple of dollars wouldn’t really make the biggest difference  It really wouldn’t ”  Walgreen and Dunkin’ Donuts declined to comment   nArline pays 30 percent of her income to live in a subsidized apartment at a Braintree housing complex  about $430 a month when she was working full time  her daughter has to contribute 30 percent of half of her income  Through MassHealth  the state’s Medicaid program  they get free health coverage  an average value of $550 a month per person  n  1 in 5 in the state  stand to get a bump in pay from the minimum wage increase  according to the Massachusetts Budget and Policy Center — 85 percent of them above the age of 20  The new law requires employers to pay workers no less than $11 an hour by 2017 Still  the minimum wage increase won’t do much to address ever widening income inequality  Boston has the between rich and poor among the country’s 50 largest cities  according to the   In Boston  the top 5 percent of households earned more than $222 000 a year  15 times more than the lowest 20 percent  which had incomes of less than $14 600 a year  In addition  Massachusetts’ minimum wage is not tied to inflation  which means as the prices of groceries  rent  and electricity rise  workers will fall further behind  advocates said  The Massachusetts Budget and Policy Center estimates that by 2017  $11 will be worth $10 32 in today’s dollars  As the plight of low wage workers gets more attention  the push to raise the minimum wage has gained momentum  The Senate recently voted down a bill that would have raised the federal minimum wage from $7 25 to $10 10 an hour  But a handful of states  including California  have moved to lift their minimum wages above $10 an hour  and $15 an hour was just passed in Seattle The next step  workers’ advocates say  is shifting the conversation from a minimum wage to a living one  Across the country  fast food and other low paid workers have demonstrated for $15 an hour  an amount that organizers in Massachusetts say is needed to meet the basic needs of working families “The economic glass of a low wage earner earning $8 to $9 an hour is pretty empty  so to move up to $11 an hour is like getting the glass around 40 percent filled toward a living wage ” said Lew Finfer  co chair of Raise Up Massachusetts  which had been pushing for a minimum wage increase inde  to inflation  “We know we’re not finished creating the opportunity and dignity that people need ” The bump to $11 would give full time workers making between $8 and $10 an hour an extra $6 000 and $2 000 a year  respectively  before taxes  said MIT professor Amy Glasmeier  who developed the Living Wage Calculator  That’s not trivial  “To somebody who’s making $22 000 a year  if you added $2 000 a year to their lives ” she said  “it could keep them from potentially losing their job because they can’t get there because they can’t fix their car ”But those who oppose the higher minimum wage say it will hurt opportunity by forcing employers to reduce hours  hire fewer people — especially teens and college students — and possibly even move out of state  That  they say  will hurt the economy overall  Erin Calvo Bacci  owner of a chocolate manufacturing business in Swampscott and the Chocolate Truffle shop in Reading  said she already is dealing with higher chocolate prices and smaller profit margins  so increased labor costs will be a serious blow  Passing along higher costs by raising prices for distributors such as Whole Foods Market and TJX Cos  isn’t really an option  she said  That could lead them to replace her products with cheaper ones  said Calvo Bacci  who had to sell her home in Wakefield in 2010 to keep the business running “There’s this big push to raise up the American families  but they’re doing it on the backs of American family businesses in Massachusetts ” she said  “Now we have to look long and hard at  Can we afford to stay in Massachusetts ” Meanwhile  Arline and Ashley Urquhart  the mother and daughter roommates in Braintree  bring home less than $1 500 a month between them — plus a little extra when Arline sings in a cover band  They are trying to get more hours and are eager for the minimum wage increases to kick in  which they say could allow them to put some money in their empty savings account  But they don’t expect it to lift them out of a

of the most popular ride sharing services  which allow customers to use applications on their smartphones to summon drivers and pay them directly  Across the country  battles are raging to regulate the companies  nThe Patrick administration wants to help such companies grow  while following a basic standard “in a way that both supports innovation and consumer choice and ensures public safety ” Jesse Mermell  a spokeswoman for the governor  said  nBut Stephen Regan  a spokesman for the Massachusetts Regional Taxi Advocacy Group  said he sees the governor’s plan as an attempt “to legitimize what even they now acknowledge is a business model that’s not in compliance with the law ” nIn Boston  as in other major cities across the country  the taxi industry has waged a strong campaign against ride sharing services saying their lack of transparency and regulation should become a public safety issue  Critics cite  and an  also in San Francisco nLate Monday night  Boston police said they were investigating three separate reports of assaults of women early Sunday who had arranged transportation from ride share companies Police did not identify the company or companies the women contacted but said the incidents occurred between roughly 1 and 3 a m  in Dorchester  the Allston Brighton area  and an unspecified location between Faneuil Hall and Dorchester   One driver is alleged to have touched a woman inappropriately  a second attempted to do so  and a third allegedly indecently assaulted a female  police said  In one case  the woman was in the suspect’s car when she received a text from the actual ride share driver she had arranged to meet The regulations proposed by the Patrick administration would require ride sharing companies to conduct national background checks and bar drivers with convictions within 10 years for “crimes of violence  sexual abuse  driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol  hit and run  attempting to evade the police  driving with a suspended or revoked license  felony robbery  or felony fraud ” The companies would also be required to ban all registered sex offenders Those rules appear to coincide with what Uber and Lyft

regulation in Massachusetts follows a playbook other states have used  California  the home of both Uber and Lyft   on the statewide level Ride sharing services came under the aegis of California Public Utilities Commission  which allowed Uber and Lyft to operate their vehicles under new rules for “transportation network companies” rather than be subject to the regulations for existing taxi companies or other “for hire” driving services nThe new rules proposed by Patrick’s administration would also create a “transportation network company” category and name the Department of Public

Patrick’s former chief of staff   to lobby the administration as the company entered the Massachusetts market  nState records show Uber paid Rubin $5 000 for his work in January 2013 and that Rubin

alarm fire raged unchecked for nearly three hours  Loss was estimated at $750 000   nIN area and number of buildings involved  it was Boston’s worst conflagration in more than 100 years  Incredibly  there we no deaths  though flames spread with lightning speed through wooden three deckers  But 31 persons were hospitalized  including five fireman who are in serious condition  At least 225 others were treated at the scene for minor injuries  The fire burned through a four block area between Andrew and Edward Everett sqs   on the  South Boston Dorchester line  The area is bounded by Dorchester av   Boston st   Dorset st  and Howell st   nIt is close to the Southeast Expressway and the artery was clogged for miles as motorists stopped to watch  Hundreds of residents—elderly persons and young mothers with little children—fled for their lives ahead of the roaring  crackling flames  They snatched up what few precious possessions they could lay hands on and ran in panic through a rain of blazing embers  Nineteen of the three family homes they left behind were burned to the ground  with everything they contained  Sixteen others were damaged in varying degrees  Homes outside as well as inside the fire perimeter were hastily evacuated  Several thousand forlorn evacuees moved ina steady procession way from the danger zone At the height of the fire  flames leaped 150 feet above the doomed buildings  A towering pillar of black smoke  visible for 20 miles  obscured the sun and turned afternoon into twilight  An army of 1000 men and 150 pieces of apparatus from 25 communities battled to contain the blaze  The movement of equipment necessitated by the fire covered eastern Massachusetts  It was the largest since the disastrous Plymouth forest fire  While ruins still smouldered  state and city moved quickly to provide shelter and necessities of life for those permanently or temporarily homeless  Friday night  200 police patrolled the blackened  smoking area to guard against looting  By then almost all the homeless had been relocated  at least for the time being “It is almost unbelievable that such a fire could be put out with no loss of life ” said Acting Chief John E  Clougherty as he surveyed the ruins First arriving police and firemen  with city workers already in the area  were largely responsible for getting people out ahead of the flames  A five man rubbish collecting crew ran through the houses on Bellflower st   warning occupants to flee for their lives The crew helped a woman and child from a blazing piazza  then dashed upstairs and dropped another mother and three youngsters into the arms of men below   nNobody knows what started the fire  It apparently began on a back porch at 26 Bellflower st The first alarm  at 1 40 p m   was followed within moments by a score of frantic calls from residents  From its small beginning  the fire was spread with enormous speed by strong southwest winds and by hundreds of hot air and heating fuel explosions  Flames climbed the read of No  26 and spread to homes of either side  then leaped across the narrow street  Within minutes a dozen tenements were ablaze  As its size grew  the blaze generated heat so intense as to create its own wind and move directly against the stiff southwest breeze  The dread “fire storm” was fought by a method developed in Hamburg  Germany  during the incendiary bombing raids of World War II  On Two Fronts Men and apparatus were massed in an “L” formation at the leeward side of the fire  facing the wind  to contain the flames  On the other side  firemen directed their hoselines upwards to cool the great cloud of heat that  by radiation  was spreading the blaze in advance of the flames  It was two and a half hours before they had slowed this radiation and brought the fire to a point where they knew it would spread no farther  Then they had the job of dousing the raging flames within the fire perimeter At its worst  the heat was so intense that men could get no nearer than 500 feet without suffering skin burns  even under the cover of wide spraying hoselines  Veteran officers at the scene agreed that they had never seen such a fire   nStreets in the district are narrow and congested  There are no open spaces to stop spreading the flames  The fire was blown in the direction of Andrew sq   a half mile away  Firebrands rained over the area Extra apparatus had to be detailed to put out 250 roof fires  some as far as two miles from the scene  Just outside the fire perimeter  frantic householders wet down their homes with garden hoses as the flames approached  Inside  tenement after tenement collapsed with a rumbling roar and a vast shower of sparks  Many firemen were burned or injured by falling debris  On Bellflower st   there were 13 three deckers totally destroyed and five damaged  On Dorset st   six destroyed and five damaged  On Howell st   five damaged  nThe total estimate of loss was made by fire insurance agents at the scene  The fire department said only that it was “of great magnitude ” In the confusion at the scene two little children could not be accounted for  and for hours were feared dead  Late in the afternoon they turned up  unharmed  at the home of relatives  One blessing was the older children were still school when the fire started  Many returned to ind only cellar holes and charred timbers where their homes had stood when they left that morning  Weeping and terrified  they stood huddled in little groups or wandered the debris choked streets  looking for their families A vacant lot on Dorset was crammed with belongings carried out by fleeing residents   nThe exodus ahead of the devouring flames was pitiful  Young mothers ran with babies in their arms  Old people carried pets  religious statues—whatever seemed most precious  One elderly woman in a wheel chair was pushed down in the street by a little boy as blazing embers dropped all around them  Civilians helped firemen lay hoselines and carried the old and crippled to safety  Scores of autos parked inside the fire area were burned  There was no time to move them out of harm’s way  District Chief John Greene and his men were first on the scene  moments after the original alarm  Rounding into Bellflower st   they saw the tenements already ablaze  nChief Green saw flames jumping the street just in front of him  He and his men had to make a hasty retreat  They were forced steadily back towards Dorchester av  as the fire bore down on them before they had time to hook up hoselines     Deputy Fred Clauss  on the scene soon after  ordered the fifth alarm  then called in the terse message  “The whole area is afire  Send me everything you can lay hands on ”Seven additional calls were ordered at short intervals to bring more equipment and men Twice in the early stages  the army of apparatus was forced to retreat and regroup because of the unbearable heat and the fast spreading flames Three hundred Boston and 100 Metropolitan police officers were detailed to the fire scene and tremendous traffic jam it engendered   nThey roped off the immediate fire area to keep civilians out of the way of emergency equipment  The ropes had to be continually moved as the fire spread  All streets in the area  including the busy arteries of Dorchester av  and Southampton sts   were closed  as were off ramps from the Expressway  Hundreds of motorists abandoned their cars on the Expressway to watch the fire  Embers touched off brush fires on both sides of the artery  causing smoke so thick that traffic was slowed to a creep Red Cross and Salvation Army disaster units were sent to the scene from 30 communities around Boston Forty first aid stations were set up to treat the steady stream of firemen

They had flown the French flag in his honor and welcomed him with local pastries and a handwritten sign that read “Bienvenue ” Random students stuck their heads out of classrooms  offering the diplomat a giddy “Bonjour ”For weeks  Codman Academy Charter Public School had been awaiting the arrival of Fabien Fieschi  the consul general of France in Boston  whom they had tried to confront months earlier at his Back Bay office  They wanted an explanation for why his government has advised French tourists to avoid walking at night in their Dorchester neighborhood  as well as in Roxbury and Mattapan  because of concerns about crime They hoped that once in their school  surrounded by the great mulligatawny that is Codman Square  he would accede to their wishes  see it was safe  and order the French Foreign Ministry to replace the warnings on its website with rosier language So many of them were aghast when he balked at doing so “It should not be taken as offensive  not to you  because you’re not responsible for everything that happens in your neighborhood ” he told students and school staff Wednesday morning Fieschi  who lives in Cambridge and has served as consul general in Boston for about a year  told them it was his duty to protect French citizens  who he said rely on information from the Foreign Ministry to remain safe around the world  He explained that shootings are much rarer in France and that the preponderance of violent crimes in Boston occurs in Dorchester  Roxbury  and Mattapan  justifying the warnings “French taxpayers pay taxes for us to provide them services and information  and providing information about security is part of our job ” he said  “If we just say that we won’t say anything about security  because it’s going to create problems for myself         we would fail to do our jobs and betray our citizens ”He also cited a letter he sent the school after students came unannounced to his office in November “The solution probably does not consist of ‘shooting the messenger ’ ” he wrote  “but in making sure that neighborhoods that suffer more than others from crime benefit from improvements in their situation ”He added  “Fortunately  this is not impossible ” noting that the city’s old Combat Zone no longer requires a “specific advisory ”Thammy Pierre Louis  17  a senior at the school  where all juniors and seniors are required to study French  rolled her eyes as she listened to Fieschi  “I thought it was all a blow off ” she said afterward  “I thought he was ignoring us  ignoring everything we said ”Students called the Foreign Ministry’s travel warnings racist  noting they advised French nationals to avoid areas mainly where members of minority groups live  Fieschi rejected that notion  saying that if there were a spike in crime on Beacon Hill  he would immediately advise the ministry to warn citizens to be cautious there “I understand he wants to look out for his people  but to cast our neighborhood in a negative way is just wrong ” said Shantelle Stewart  17  a senior  “It was hurtful what he said ”While happy that the consul general accepted their invitation  Meg Campbell  the school’s executive director  said she was disappointed  “I am distressed that he doesn’t seem to be able to hear us ” she said  “He’s very stuck in his view ”While slides of the finer parts of the neighborhood flashed on a screen beside Fieschi  including the John F  Kennedy Presidential Library and the University of Massachusetts Boston  Haley Malm  the school’s French teacher  explained that the Foreign Ministry had removed three suburbs of Cleveland from its travel advisories and said she hoped they would do the same for Boston “We’re adamant that the warnings be changed ” she said afterward  “It’s frustrating that he doesn’t seem amenable to change ”For his part  Fieschi said he was walking away with things to think about  He said the ministry has debated whether it is worth the uproar incurred by the specificity of the warnings  He noted the ministry has been accused of racism elsewhere in the United States as a result of its advisories “This has caused us a lot of negative reaction ” he said As he left the building and headed with an aide to their car  where a driver awaited  he said he was happy to have made the trip  The tricolor flapped above them  beside the Stars and Stripes “We do not want to hurt

contend that Veolia locked the workers out of the bus yards  preventing them from driving after they tried to meet with company officials to hash out their grievances over pay  benefits  and other issues The activists have held several rallies urging that the workers be rehired  but this was the first one endorsed by the AFL CIO of Massachusetts  the umbrella labor group that represents 750 unions statewide Standing on the back of a truck  Bishop Filipe Teixeira of St  Martin de Porres Church in Dorchester  called on Walsh  a former labor leader  to urge Veolia to rehire the fired drivers “I hope Mayor Walsh will do the right thing by his brothers ” Teixeira told the rally of about 150 cheering activists gathered outside the gates of a city school bus yard  “We know that you are union and that you love unions  Do the right thing ”Walsh  in a statement released after the rally  declined to call for the rehiring of the drivers  t t n“There is a National Labor Relations Board process in place to address this issue ” he said  “I urge the parties involved to act quickly in this private matter to ensure that our students have reliable  safe transportation getting to and from school ”Speaker after speaker at the rally denounced Veolia for firing the drivers and accused the company of trying to bust the bus drivers’ union “It’s an absolute disgrace ” said Richard Rogers  the executive secretary treasurer of the Greater Boston Labor Council  a federation of 154 unions  “They have a responsibility to honor the union contract  The city is paying for that contract  and it’s wrong ”Fliers for the rally listed Steven Tolman  the president of the state AFL CIO  as one of the speakers  but he did not show up Tolman said he was in Ashland at a meeting of prominent business executives and nonprofit leaders  He said he supports the fired workers but does not believe Walsh should intervene on their behalf  “Marty’s got to run the city ” Tolman said  “He can’t get involved in every labor dispute ”Veolia released a statement Saturday saying the rally “does not legitimatize the illegal strike ” The statement said the workers’ contract “specifically prevents work stoppages and strikes  and provides grounds for termination of employees who lead and instigate strikes ”Veolia also said there is an ongoing arbitration process for the drivers to air grievances “In the meantime  claims of company refusals to meet and a lockout of employees as after the fact justifications for the work stoppage are as false today as when they were first made by the radical element” of the bus drivers’ union following the strike  Veolia said  “As time goes by  neither the facts surrounding October 8th nor the reasons justifying the termination of these four employees  change ”The fired drivers said they believe they were targeted because they have all been leaders in the bus drivers’ union “They can’t pick four people out of 800 individuals and say  ‘You did something different ’ u2009” said Garry Murchison  61  a former president of the union and 30 year veteran bus driver who was fired last year The speakers at the rally included Mel King  the longtime activist and 1983 mayoral candidate  and Chuck Turner  the former city councilor convicted in a   Councilor Charles C  Yancey was the only current officeholder to attend  He urged other elected officials in Boston to voice their support for the fired drivers “We are not going to tolerate anyone disrespecting our workers  particularly those workers who transport our precious children every

164,,,,,,,,,"('A Bristol Superior Court judge has rejected a defense request to dismiss all charges against Aaron Hernandez  the former New England Patriots player accused of killing a Dorchester man in 2013 In the ruling released Thursday  Judge E  Susan Garsh rejected defense arguments that Hernandez has been wrongly accused of murder because Bristol prosecutors have not shown who actually fired the shots that killed Odin L  Lloyd in a North Attleborough industrial park  t n“The Commonwealth was not required to present evidence before the grand jury as to exactly how Hernandez participated in the murder or as to who shot Lloyd  given the strong evidence that Hernandez’’ or two Hernandez allies shot the man  Garsh wrote in her ruling The defense also contended  Garsh wrote  that the only thing proven by Bristol District Attorney C  Samuel Sutter’s office is that Hernandez was in a car with his friends  Ernest Wallace and Carlos Ortiz  when they picked up Lloyd in Dorchester and drove to North Attleborough “He claims that the evidence demonstrated no more than his presence in the car with Ortiz  Wallace  and Lloyd shortly before Lloyd was shot to death ’’ Garsh wrote  But “the grand jury heard sufficient evidence to establish probable cause that Hernandez intentionally participated in some meaningful way in the commission of the offense’’ of first degree murder In summarizing the government’s evidence against the former star tight end  Garsh identified what appears to be the alleged motive for Lloyd’s killing  although the judge noted that prosecutors are not required by state law to prove why someone commits a murder According to the ruling  Hernandez  armed with a handgun  and Lloyd went to a Boston nightclub on June 14  2013  In the early morning hours  Hernandez and Lloyd drove to a townhouse in Franklin that Hernandez owned  t nThey were accompanied by two women  Hernandez’s primary residence was in North Attleborough  where he lived with his girlfriend  Shayanna Jenkins  and their child Hernandez later became upset that he had taken Lloyd to the Franklin property  according to Garsh “ ‘Somehow  I  told  Lloyd  about my other spot  and I just woke up bugging ’ ” Hernandez was quoted as saying  Garsh wrote With information from the women  police searched the Franklin property after the murder and found  45 caliber ammunition  the same type used to kill Lloyd  the judge noted Hernandez allegedly summoned Wallace and Ortiz from their shared hometown of Bristol  Conn   on June 16  Garsh wrote  At about 2 30 a m   Hernandez  Wallace  and Ortiz drove to Dorchester where they picked up Lloyd from his Fayston Street home Lloyd was shot to death about 3 30 a m  A few minutes later  Hernandez and the two men returned to his North Attleborough home  Garsh said the former NFL player had what appeared to be a  45 caliber pistol in his hand “The uncontested evidence was more than adequate to meet the Commonwealth’s burden of establishing probable cause ’’ Garsh wrote  “Hernandez is not entitled to dismissal of the indictments ’’ n', '2014_1138')",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"('The state’s eight most ethnically and racially diverse communities are still policed by a predominantly white corps of officers  despite years of efforts to dispel perceptions of racism and diversify their ranks But against the backdrop of unrest in Ferguson  Mo   many local law enforcement officials say they have worked to forge relationships with community groups that would quell the type of outrage that exploded in Ferguson following the Aug  9 fatal shooting of an unarmed black teenager by a white officer  t n“You’ve got to have those partnerships  so that if something does happen  you can reach out to either side ” said Kevin Coppinger  the police chief in Lynn  whose department has sought to make inroads in a Latino community that makes up 31 percent of the city’s population  “You’ve got to have a dialogue ” Coppinger said  In Ferguson  much has been made of the racial divide between the police department and the community  While nearly 70  percent of Ferguson’s residents are black  more than 94 percent of the department is white  Disparities in Massachusetts are not as stark  But local officials acknowledge that they have struggled for years to diversify police department ranks  a challenge they attribute to failed recruitment efforts and obstructive state Civil Service rules that govern hiring “Ferguson brought this to the forefront  but we’ve always been having this conversation ” said Mayor Daniel Rivera of Lawrence  acknowledging a disparity in his city of 76 331  where white residents make up only about 20 percent of the population  but account for nearly 77 percent of the police force  He sent a letter to the state Human Resources Division earlier this year highlighting concerns with decades old rules that govern the department’s hiring process   t nThe Globe examined eight Massachusetts communities where a majority of the population is neither white nor Hispanic Some departments have grappled with accusations of racial profiling  an issue compounded by lack of diversity The town of Randolph  for example  was forced by the US Department of Justice a decade ago to provide cultural training for officers and build better community partnerships after two high profile allegations of racial profiling  In one case  a black off duty Boston police officer said he was harassed and mistaken for a shooting suspect as he was leaving a sandwich shop  In another case  officers allegedly used racial slurs and roughhoused young black men during an altercation at a fast food restaurant  The population of black residents in Randolph  a town of 32 383  nearly doubled between 2000 and 2010  according to Census figures  but the police force remains 81 percent white  The town is 38 4 percent white  Randolph Police Chief William Pace said the town has tried to hire people of color into the department  but the number of open positions has been outpaced by the town’s rapidly changing demographics  “It’s just taking time to filter through ” Pace said  David Harris Jr   a Randolph civil rights activist who founded and once chaired the police advisory council  said that residents see “a disconnect between the police and the community of color ” “The power structure is mostly white  and you have this tremendously diverse community  And  the police department  is not a reflection of the community itself ” Harris said  James Madden  who interviewed dozens of Randolph residents for his 2010 MIT thesis for a master’s degree on city planning  said that people of color reported avoiding Route 28 heading into Randolph because they feared being stopped by town police  That practice has stopped  he said  but the memory lingers  Of the state’s most diverse municipalities  Boston’s police department is by far the most representative of its city’s demographics  though the department has struggled to diversify its upper ranks  Black residents make up just over a quarter of the city’s population and make up 23 2 percent of the police force  Asians and Latinos are slightly underrepresented  The city last year named William G  Gross as the superintendent in chief  the department’s first black second in command  While other communities simply advertise a desire for more officers of color  Boston has sent officers into neighborhoods such as Roxbury  Mattapan  and Dorchester to identify and mentor promising candidates for the department  said Jack McDevitt  who runs the Institute on Race and Justice at Northeastern University  and tracked Boston’s efforts  And  McDevitt added  Boston is in the midst of a $2 million overhaul of its promotional exams  specifically to eliminate performance gaps between white and minority officers seeking to enter the department’s higher ranks  Phillip Goff  cofounder and president of the Center for Policing Equity at the University of California Los Angeles  said that while it is important for police departments to better reflect their communities  particularly in their upper ranks  it is equally important that the department creates positive relationships with the community   “If I’m getting my behind beaten  it doesn’t matter what the person looks like ” said Goff  who will be a visiting scholar this year at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government  “The folks in the community need to feel they are being treated fairly  that they have involvement  a say  and that in the end they feel the law enforcement agency shares their values ”In Ferguson  he said  “there wasn’t enough trust on file ”When Chelsea Police Chief Brian Kyes joined the police force in 1987  he said  there was just one Spanish speaking officer and one black officer  There are now 27 Latino officers on the 103 member force “Is that equal  No  But we’re making our way ” the chief said  “We are over time getting to the point where we’re reflecting the community we serve  not in the sense where we look like the community we serve  but where we can at least communicate with the community we serve ” In Lawrence  Rivera  the mayor  said he attended high school with many of the city’s police officers  and many of them have sought to cross the cultural gap with the community by learning Spanish  and interacting with community groups  “The generation of police officers we have now grew up in the city  have seen the city change  understand the city and how we need to police the community ” Rivera said  “You couldn’t paint a more different picture than what’s going on in Ferguson ” From Chelsea to Lawrence  police departments have worked to sharpen what Goff calls the “art to community policing ” That means calming communities after violent incidents  but it can also be as mundane as explaining the need for local ordinances  like those regulating noise limits  or restricting double parking  In Holyoke  where white residents account for 48 percent of the population but 77 percent of the police force  Chief James M  Neiswanger has officers walking neighborhoods  and this year officers began participating in cultural awareness training “I think we’re all learning from Ferguson  And I think the face of policing will be different a year from now than it is today ” said Neiswanger  “Ferguson is another version of Rodney King  It forces police to look at what we’re doing and what we could do better ” In Brockton  the department has appointed Elisa Fontes  who is Cape Verdean  as the department’s community resource officer  The department has also created partnerships with youth leadership groups  One of the teenage founders of the Brockton Youth Council is now an intern with the department  helping to create new youth programs and  as he put it  new community relationships  “There’s youth that tell me  why do I work for the police department  Why do I work with the police department ” said Anthony Fowler  18  who describes himself as multiracial  and is studying to become a police officer  “I try to break that stigma           You make a good relationship with your officer  It’s like a phone call  it’s two ways ” Fowler said  “You give respect  you get respect ”Fontes describes an ongoing effort to engage minority communities in Brockton  where 40 percent of the population — but only 13 percent of the police force — is black  She recently provided a reporter a tour of the city  stopping by Cape Verdean restaurants  the city’s tropical grocery store  and a park where the homeless congregate  She called out greetings in English and Cape Verdean Creole to residents she knows by name One of them  on perhaps Fontes’s most important stop of the day  was Larina Depina  a 14 year old Cape Verdean girl who told Fontes she wants to become a police officer   nThey sat in Depina’s front yard to talk about her education  the need to respect her parents  ways to avoid peer pressure  and the possibility of joining a Teen Police Academy “It seems very easy to do all that ” Depina told Fontes  smiling  “It sounds easy  but realistically  sometimes you’re gonna have that struggle ” said Fontes  “I can guide you ”Depina told Fontes that her love for the police originated with the crime shows she watches with her little sister  Fontes was the first real police officer she had ever spoken with  she said  other than the police who showed up at her door when she was about 6 years old and accidentally called 911  Depina was shy during their conversation  but did not stop smiling  As she left  Fontes said the girl reminded her of herself  “A lot of these youth will tell you  ‘you don’t know what I’m dealing with ’ u2002” Fontes said  “I can sit there and tell them  ‘yes I do know ’ u2002” Other law enforcement officials pointed out the need to simply have conversations with community groups  to build cultural understanding   nCoppinger  the Lynn chief  said he has reached out to leaders in the Guatemalan community in his city  to find out why immigrants would not report crimes  He learned of their distrust of police in their home country   The chief says he himself gained a better cultural understanding of Asian communities after simply speaking to fellow officers in the 1980s  who explained to Coppinger why new immigrants were reluctant to turn their backs toward police  In their home countries  that would mean they were to be executed “But we didn’t know that ” he said  “We had to tell them  it’s commonplace in some countries  but it’s not commonplace in Lynn ” While police officials said that starting the conversation is important  they emphasized that there is also a need for such conversations to be continuous  “We can’t be strangers to one another ” said Kyes  the Chelsea police chief', '2014_1027')",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

169,,,,,,,,,"('Boston Interim Superintendent John McDonough Wednesday night presented a balanced budget for the next school year that calls for cutting about 120 central office positions and slashing bus rides for seventh  and eighth graders The $973 million spending plan  which requires School Committee approval  would also eliminate nearly 250 teachers  classroom aides  and other school based positions  t nUnder the busing cuts  seventh  and eighth graders who would have qualified for rides will instead receive MBTA passes The School Department also intends to try out the MBTA option with sixth graders on a voluntary basis  Any sixth grader who wants to ride the bus  however  would be able to get a seat  The change would affect more than 4 500 students “We believe this is the best for our schools and students  and it puts us in a strategic position so we don’t have to go elsewhere in the budget for savings ” McDonough said in an interview  But  he added  “We need to ensure families  that  we are able to provide safe and reliable transportation regardless of the mode of transportation ”The proposal  presented at a School Committee meeting Wednesday night  represents a revision of a similar proposal unveiled earlier this month  The biggest difference is that the budget is now balanced and offers greater details about where the spending cuts would occur Dozens of parents and students turned out for the presentation  and many spoke out against the cuts “I’m here to urge the mayor and the state to fund things that work ” said Susan Field  a parent from the Mendell Elementary School in Roxbury Laura Buckmaster  a student in the adult education program  pleaded with the School Committee to restore money for the program  which is losing all city funding and will have to rely on minimal grant dollars “The adult education program is my hope ” said Buckmaster  who shared a personal story about how the program has helped her learn how to read  “It’s a light in the community          Please find a way to fund the program ”The cuts are being made even though school spending is expected to increase by nearly 4 percent next year  thanks to additional funding by Mayor Martin J  Walsh  who is directing other departments to reduce budgets  The increase in school spending  however  is not enough to keep pace with rising salaries and other costs  along with a reduction in federal and state aid To balance the budget  the School Department had to cut $107 million  McDonough  in an effort to minimize cuts to individual schools  is overhauling and consolidating several departments in the central office  yielding $39 million in savings  He said the School Department is identifying exactly which of the 120 positions will be cut  but said most would likely be managerial  There are roughly 800 positions in the central office Switching the seventh  and eighth graders to T passes makes up the majority of $11 million in transportation savings identified  Tapping T passes for students in those grade levels is not new  The passes  are already used by approximately 1 800 sixth   seventh   and eighth graders from about nine schools  including Boston Latin School in the Fenway  Dearborn Middle School in Roxbury  and the TechBoston Academy in Dorchester Hardin Coleman  a school board member  urged officials to examine the change’s impact on attendance and tardiness The School Department is also proposing to cut shuttle bus service to and from MBTA stations to high schools within a mile away  That would affect nearly all of the large high school complexes  except West Roxbury’s Debate over spending cuts has been growing loud  as parents organize across the city Driving many school cuts is overprojections for enrollment this school year that caused the School Department to open classrooms that turned out to be unnecessary  Correcting this problem will result in about $11 million in savings Susanne Bartlett  cochair of the school

killing was announced “Lord  we’re not advocating for violence  and Lord  we’re not looking for any lawlessness ” he said from the pulpit  “But we are looking for justice  and we are looking for people to stand at this critical time ” t nMinisters and congregants continued calling for justice and asserting the dignity of young African American men nearly a week after a grand jury’s decision not to indict police Officer Darren Wilson in the shooting death of Michael Brown Jr At Twelfth Baptist  where Boston residents and government officials had gathered Tuesday to discuss the grand jury decision  ministers commended local protesters for a peaceful march following that meeting and called for continued nonviolent efforts to bring racial equality “As we asked you last Sunday         whichever way the verdict went  remember that we’re a people of praise          whatever demonstrations  whatever responses  that they should be done decently and in order ” said the Rev  Arthur T  Gerald Jr   the senior pastor  “I want to thank those of you that are here today because you responded decently and in order ”The Rev  Willie Bodrick II  youth minister at Twelfth Baptist  said in an interview that he was “not         stunned” by the grand jury decision or the protests that followed  because “last year we heard a similar response to the Trayvon Martin verdict ” in which George Zimmerman was acquitted in the killing of the unarmed black teen Bodrick  26  said he was “hurt” the Brown case did not proceed to trial  but the moment should be a learning opportunity “My hope is that we’re proactive in making sure that we deal with the real conversation of race in America  which I think is a deep wound that we as a country keep putting Band Aids over ” he said  nAt Pleasant Hill Baptist Church in Dorchester  the Rev  Miniard Culpepper said the parents of young men in the church  and the young men themselves  have been on “high alert” since the decision “We’re just beginning to start a new mentoring program for the young men ” he said  “But we’ve always made it a routine to teach our young men about how to carry themselves  especially when encountering the police “I have two sons  ages 23 and 24  both in law school right now  And I’ve always counseled them to follow whatever the police have asked them to do  to be respectful  and avoid confrontations ”Outside Twelfth Baptist  congregants said they were frustrated  though not necessarily surprised  by the grand jury’s decision “It’s just unfair  really ” said Sasha Anselme  20  of Randolph  “I feel like all these protests are actually good and they’re helpful          Hopefully this will start to change things ”Anselme said he has had no negative experiences with Boston police  and he believes the department’s relationship with the community is more respectful than in some cities  however  he also feels many people see him differently than they see a white man the same age Twelfth Baptist congregant Lindsay Joseph  23  said she worries that her 3 year old son may be treated differently because of the color of his skin Joseph  of Woburn  said in a phone interview Sunday that too often  people judge young black men based on stereotypes  and that the violence that has accompanied some Ferguson protests is driven by frustration “I don’t condone the violence by any means  but at the same time  too  it’s about looking at where the violence stems from as opposed to the violence itself ” she said  “It comes from poverty  it comes from poor education systems  it comes from mass incarceration  it comes from just not having the basic accommodations that people ought to have as Americans ”At Pleasant Hill  Jackie Scott chatted with fellow parishioners about “how churches need to turn their lights on  literally and figuratively  to let people in the streets know to come in and get answers ”Scott  a retired Boston  nteacher who has attended Pleasant Hill for 50 years  raised two sons  now 49 and 41  in the city  n“I remember when they were younger  encouraging them to be respectful in their dealings with police  but also praying for them to not get caught in the violence that happens between the young people ” Scott said “And that’s the same struggle parents of younger people are having today — from both sides ” she continued  “It’s tough  but like pastor has been

another sign that the economic recovery has yet to reach millions of people in New England and across the country Historically  the numbers of so called involuntary part time workers increase during recessions and their immediate aftermaths as companies cut hours and cautiously add employees  Once the economy picks up  those numbers typically fall quickly   t nBut today some 7 million Americans are working part time even though they want full  time jobs — nearly 3 million more than in 2007  when the last recession began  according to the Labor Department “It is a cause for alarm ” said John Silvia  chief economist for Wells Fargo   Co   in Charlotte  N C   “I don’t think since World War II we’ve seen this kind of dislocation ”Silvia and other economists worry that the high levels of involuntary part time work indicate a “new normal” in which companies increasingly rely on part time rather than full time employees  much as they have replaced full time  permanent positions with temporary or contract workers  As with temps and contractors  having more part timers allows employers to cut costs  since the workers often do not qualify for health insurance and other benefits Its also increases employers’ flexibility to ramp up or cut their workforces as economic conditions change  economists said Jim O’Sullivan  the chief US economist at High Frequency Economics  a forecasting firm in Valhalla  N Y   said the number of part time workers who want but can’t find full time jobs has shrunk to less than 5 percent of the total labor force from 6 percent during the worst of the recession  which ended in June 2009  Those numbers should continue to decline as the economy improves  he said But  O’Sullivan added  “Will it return to prerecession levels  Probably not  But I don’t expect to see the unemployment rate at  the prerecession low of  4 5 percent in a few years  either ”The October unemployment rate was 5 8 nationally and 6 percent in Massachusetts  nThe jump in the number of part time workers extends beyond industries that have traditionally used large numbers of these employees  such as restaurants and retail  The number of involuntary part timers in finance  for example  surged more than 75 percent between 2007 and 2013  to nearly 45 000  according to the Labor Department In hospitals  involuntary part time workers have doubled to more than 100 000 since 2007 Jewel Ingalls   29  of Newton  N H   studied for two years at Northern Essex Community College in Haverhill to earn an associate’s degree and become a radiologic technologist  When she graduated in May  she took a per diem job at Lawrence General Hospital  working unscheduled shifts as they opened up   The pay was good but the hours were sporadic and unpredictable  she never knew if she would be working two or 20 days a month This fall  she landed another job with a set schedule at another hospital  but she’s still working part time  17 hours a week  Ingalls said she delivers important radiation treatments to patients  but does not qualify for health care benefits through her employer  To help makes ends meet  she works one day a week as a hairdresser  her prior profession  “You almost have to have another job ” Ingalls said  “You need to have a back up until that position opens up and you get that full time spot somewhere ”The Affordable Care Act  also known as Obamacare  may be contributing to some employers’ reluctance to hire full time workers because the law requires businesses with more than 50 full time employees to provide health insurance or pay a government fee  The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia recently released a survey of employers that found 5 percent of employers would increase part time hiring in response to the new health care act  while 11 3 percent said they would reduce full time hiring Kate Nelson of Beverly said she should be in her prime earning years  but instead must piece together an income working as an adjunct  or part time  instructor at a community college and a training consultant to nonprofits — work that “comes and goes ” she said Now 58  she has taught writing and English at the school since 2010  The number of courses she teaches each semester varies  it might be one  but usually it is two  The maximum is three  which she is teaching this semester  Her income from teaching is under $15 000 a year  without benefits  she said  Nelson said she has hoped for a full time position at the community college but no longer believes that will happen  She has sought other jobs  too  applying for executive assistant positions in her search for full time work  but without success “I’ve made my peace with the part time world ” Nelson said  “But I still feel like I have a lot to contribute ” Some economists doubt the increase in part time employment represents a permanent change in the labor force  Scott Anderson  chief economist for Bank of the West in San Francisco  said the severity of the last recession means that the economy just needs more time to heal  Still  he said  the number of involuntary part time workers is nowhere near normal levels “There’s not a lot of choices for folks ” he said  “There’s not enough full time jobs ”  David Foy  45  of Dorchester  can’t wait years  A part time shuttle bus assistant at Logan Airport  he recently had his 25 hours a week cut to fewer than

Roosevelt  He looked out at a room of people eager to hear tales from his 20 year run as a big city mayor But first  Thomas M  Menino had to will himself to stand  It was almost as if he were reenacting a scene from his memoir  when he climbed out of a wheelchair to address a service at the Cathedral of the Holy Cross a few days after the Boston Marathon bombings  t nMenino summoned a deep breath  He pushed with both hands on the arms of his wheelchair and rose to his feet  The 71 year old former mayor leaned on his old baseball bat cane and took a few shuffling steps to his seat for a discussion of his book  “Mayor for a New America ” nThe transition from mayor to author has been complicated  Menino has been weakened by cancer  And this week  just as he embarked on a book tour  laryngitis stole his voice But Tuesday night at  at Hunter College  as he sipped steaming lemon water and spoke in a gravelly whisper  Menino showed flashes of the mayoral gravitas that once permeated City Hall  When asked how Boston distributed aid money so quickly to victims of the Marathon bombings  he responded with a three word quip that delighted the crowd of roughly 75 “I’m the mayor ” Menino said The five term mayor has embarked on a whirlwind media tour  coaxing his voice to cooperate as he stops at MSNBC  Fox  and CNN  nAt the radio studios of WNYC  Menino laid the blame for Boston’s divisive school integration on politicians who kept “all the blacks in one area” and “forced” the judge to implement a faulty busing plan  Then a coughing fit interrupted Menino mid sentence Menino plans to attend private book parties at Boston University and his publisher  Houghton Mifflin Harcourt  and is scheduled next week for a book signing and media appearances in Washington  if his health allows At the end of the month  there’s a signing scheduled at  and an   Mayor Martin J  Walsh  at the Boston Book Festival  It is a far cry from the schedule he kept just 10 months ago as he moved out of his fifth floor office at City Hall “It’s quite different ” Menino said  “Now I get to be the critic ”Having the kickoff at Roosevelt House somehow seemed appropriate  underscoring Menino’s connection to the long arc of progressive politics in America  The Neo Georgian townhouse  sitting blocks away from Central Park  was one of the places where Roosevelt found a renewed sense of purpose after being paralyzed by polio The house later served as the launching pad for the political career of America’s longest serving president  In the same upper room where Roosevelt laid the foundation of the New Deal  Menino sat near a floor to ceiling window overlooking East 65th Street “Putting your memoirs together is very difficult ” Menino said over the din of cocktail chatter  “It wasn’t ever about me  It was about the city of Boston ”Former New York mayor Michael R  Bloomberg greeted Menino with the warmth of an old friend  In introductory remarks at the book party  Bloomberg described Menino as “one of the most successful mayors to ever run a city in the United States ” History  he said  will include Menino in the same breath as transcendent big city mayors the likes of New York’s Fiorello LaGuardia and Chicago’s Richard Daley “He really was the mayors’ mayor ” Bloomberg said of Menino  “When you get to heaven  my attitude is don’t stop and ask  just walk right in  You have earned this ”Menino  wearing a dark suit and a light blue tie the same hue as Boston’s city flag  recounted anecdotes and lessons from the book  He talked about the response to the Marathon bombings  the imperative to be a sound steward of city finances  and the deliberate effort to win over constituents a conversation at a time “Unless people trust you ” Menino said  “you can’t do what you want to do ”Laryngitis caused his voice to falter and crack  His wife  Angela  and his former press secretary  Dot Joyce  urged him on with gestures from the front row  They reminded him to sip his water and at one point  a throat lozenge was passed from wife to spokeswoman to mayor To distract from his rasp  Menino leaned on self deprecating quips and his trademark grin that seemed to suggest  “I’m the mayor what are you going to do about it ”Angela Menino said her husband frequently catches laryngitis in October  which often coincided with debates during election years  The former mayor has not been using a wheelchair in Boston  she said  but there was a lot of walking in New York The first audience question veered off topic when a woman asked about what she described as lack of access at Boston museums for the hearing impaired  After a brief discussion  Menino offered a solution “Talk to the new mayor ”The crowd included Menino’s daughter  Susan Menino Fenton  former top aide  Michael Kineavy  City Councilor Stephen J  Murphy  publicist George Regan  and actor Kevin Chapman Chapman is in New York filming the Detective Lionel Fusco role in the television series “Person of Interest ” He worked for Menino as neighborhood services coordinator in Dorchester for almost nine years and recalled rushing to overnight fires to help residents who lost their homes  “The biggest fear in the office was that at 3 a m  the mayor would beat you to a call ” Chapman said As a New Yorker  Dana Matlin never had a chance to vote for Menino  Just the same  the 59 year old came to the book party  lured by the mayor’s reputation  “I just wanted to hear what he had to say ” Matlin said  “I thought it was fascinating  I could see why he was so effective ”',

billion deal  nMuch has been made about the  between the current rail operator and the state  The Massachusetts Bay Commuter Railroad Co  is run by Jim O’Leary  the wunderkid who oversaw the T in the ’80s and mentored current state transportation secretary Rich Davey  nWith the MBCR being perceived as having the upper hand  one of the most lucrative rail contracts around attracted only two bidders  the incumbent and Keolis  Twenty five companies had initially expressed interest  and the T had hoped for at least a half dozen bids On Wednesday  Beverly Scott  general manager of the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority  will recommend to her board an end to MBCR’s 11 year troubled reign and give Keolis the nod at running our commuter trains  The eight year deal is shaping up to be the most lucrative operating contract in state history and could be worth even more  as much as $4 3 billion  when a four year extension is factored in  nIf the French transit company prevails  the new arrival will have done it the old fashioned way — through greasing the wheels with the help of local insiders  By my count  Team Keolis includes two former state transportation secretaries  a local commuter rail chief  and a former Boston city councilor It all started in January 2012 when Keolis executives reached out to Pat Moynihan  the former state transportation secretary  T manager  and Big Dig project director    are known globally with operations in Australia  Canada  and Europe  but have little name recognition here  Keolis has one rail contract stateside  running the Virginia Railway Express and its 32 trains  which carry about 21 000 people daily  That’s a tiny fraction of the Massachusetts system  which operates nearly 500 commuter trains and ferries about 127 000 passengers a day  nThe company’s chief concerns  Would there be a level playing field for all bidders  A bid would be a big investment — Keolis spent more than $4 million on its proposal And what about Davey  the state transportation secretary  Could he be objective  Before he came to work for the state  Davey was the general manager at MBCR  following the path of others who have moved over from there Early on  Davey recused himself from the selection process  and though a member of the T board  he won’t be voting on the project  Moynihan couldn’t make other assurances but could make introductions so Keolis executives could figure it out for themselves Moynihan  who served under governors Weld  Cellucci  and King  became Keolis’s lobbyist and brought along Mike McCormack  a former city councilor  now a lawyer and lobbyist  Later  longtime lobbyist Bobby White  a Dorchester native with deeps roots in the State House and City Hall political orbits  joined the team  All told  according to state filings  Keolis paid $450 000 in lobbying fees over two years  The company ended up meeting several dozen elected officials  transit leaders  and other stakeholders  Jim Stoetzel  who ran commuter rail service in the state back in the ’80s  also came on board  After six months of meetings  Keolis decided to bid Late last spring  McCormack looped in Alan Eisner — from George Regan’s PR shop — to act

searing worry that surfaced time and again during Kara’s long addiction to heroin and other drugs Kara  the mother of a 14 year old son  had agreed to leave within the week for a residential drug treatment program — 50 miles and more than an hour’s drive west  in Pittsfield  Her bags were packed  nBut the next day  while Niedbala was at work  whatever hope existed the night before was obliterated  “I could hear the sirens  and I knew it was her ” Niedbala said Kara died of an overdose  and her mother was left to wonder what might have happened if closer  earlier treatment had been available There are no detox facilities in sparsely populated Franklin County  where at least 12 confirmed or suspected opioid related deaths and 50 nonfatal overdoses have been recorded since December   Without detox beds  the county has no immediate way to help addicts when they first decide to wean themselves from drugs  and no beds for the immediate follow up care that helps prevent relapses  “There’s no doubt in my mind that people are dying because there are no beds ” said Michael Baldanza  an outreach worker for CARES  which offers recovery services to substance abusers Outreach workers like Baldanza can make dozens of phone calls and still fail to find beds outside the county  such as at the nearest detox facility 30 miles away in Holyoke  or at a short term residential program 40 miles away in Springfield  or at other treatment options as distant as New Bedford  Foxborough  and Boston  nThe response  Baldanza said  is almost always the same from overwhelmed facilities that cannot meet the need caused by the surge in heroin and opioid use in Massachusetts “They say  ‘Call back in two hours ’ ” Baldanza said  “It’s few and far between that I get somebody into a bed  I worry  ‘Is this person going to die overnight ’ ”That worry has become embedded in this hilly county of just 71 000 people — roughly the population of Somerville — where a rash of overdoses in January caught local officials off guard and unprepared “I was seeing the effects of it every day in our court  and we didn’t have anything in place ” said John Merrigan  register of Probate and Family Court  “It’s horrifying ”Not only did Franklin County have no place to send addicts for detox treatment  but overdoses were mounting in a statistical and informational vacuum  Neither the county nor the state was collecting overdose data in real time  and victims and their families were unsure where to turn for help “They had no idea where to go ” Franklin County Sheriff Christopher Donelan said  “And we really had nowhere to send them ”Although the county has facilities for months long residential treatment in which clients can come and go  and even hold a job  these openings are not for desperate addicts in crisis  counselors said  The county also does not have any intensive outpatient programs  which offer daily support that includes relapse prevention and case management  The closest one  20 miles south of Greenfield in Northampton Franklin County’s last detox facility  where addicts turn for several days of supervised withdrawal  was closed a decade ago following budget cuts under then governor Mitt Romney  Such facilities are critically important  counselors said  because addicts have a short window — sometimes only hours — between the time they ask for help and when they return to their habits “They have this moment when they think  ‘I really need to do something about this ’ ” said Justin McNary  community outreach coordinator for The Recover Project  a state funded program here that offers counseling and peer support for substance abusers  “But if someone tells them  ‘Not right now ’ the light goes out ”When a provider asks an addict to call back  McNary said  keeping that light aglow can be  delicate and difficult The perils of waiting for treatment are familiar to Elaina Arce  a 27 year old mother of two  who has been struggling with heroin “You want to go into rehab to get help  and they’re pushing you away  so why would I want to go ” said Arce  who lives in Greenfield  “They give you a list of phone numbers  You put your hands up and say  ‘Screw it  I’m not gonna go ’ ”The director of the state Bureau of Substance Abuse Services  Hilary Jacobs  said that Franklin County is not alone in its need for detox and follow up facilities  which are licensed and funded  not on a county by county basis  but as part of a network that divides the state into regions In fiscal 2013  Jacobs said  959 residents of Franklin County received help — from detox to follow up treatment to long term residential care — somewhere in the state The western region  which includes Franklin County  encompasses the entire state west of Ware

remains outside his comfort zone “I like Greenfield ” he said  Still  Wesolowski said  “I would like to somehow get off of Suboxone and get a stable environment  It’s been a long road  and I’m still

are concerned  but said she is working on a broader strategy that considers what the state needs overall “I’m not going to disagree with them  but I’m going to say that we want a statewide system ” Jacobs said In the interim  community leaders  physicians  law enforcement officials  and alarmed parents across Franklin County have formed a task force to fight the opioid problem  Overdoses are being tracked in real time  treatment options are being canvassed  and an aggressive education campaign has been launched “We almost felt abandoned” by the state  said Donelan  the sheriff  who estimated that 80 percent of inmates at the Franklin County House of Correction go through withdrawal in their cells  “In hindsight  what we’ve done is almost better because we’ve done it ourselves ”Merrigan  who helped jump start the task force  is prepared for a long fight  In the last two weeks  he said  the county has recorded two more opiate related deaths and about eight nonfatal overdoses

all his homework  He was excited about wearing the headset  There’s part of him that’s like a little kid about this — he was genuinely excited ”Rondo  wearing a light gray suit with a red tie and a press pass  seemed calm before the game  saying it would be “fun ” reciting the key advice he received  “Don’t curse — and smile ”Of course  Rondo participated only because he sat out of the Celtics’ 94 80 loss to rest his surgically repaired right knee because it was the second game of a back to back “It’s something I wanted to do ” he said  “I did it for the fans  I did it for my team  It’s something different  Not a lot of guys do it currently while playing  I thought it would be OK to give it a shot  I wasn’t playing a back to back  I was traveling with the team  so why not A small

again “It’s a possibility ” he said  “If the broadcast wants me back on  then we’ll see ”Overall  Rondo said the television stand up that he did was the most challenging because it was live in front of a camera  “Other than that  it was just like sitting in your living room  talking to a friend of yours  dissecting the game ” he said Not that it was easy “Mike is so good at it ” Rondo said  “He makes it look easy  And it’s not ”Rondo added of Gorman  “He’s probably the best at what he does  All the things that you don’t see on camera that he’s doing  He’s doing about 90 things in one minute

saying  ‘Wow  he’s a better kid than I thought ’ ” Gorman said Gorman expanded on that subject “I think Boston has really missed the boat with this kid ” Gorman said  “I’m a Dorchester guy  I grew up in the city  and I just think the city has missed the boat in the sense that this is a good kid  “He does a lot of good charity stuff outside of the Celtics that he’s never talked about  If BirthdayGate is the biggest offense that he has in his professional career  well  I don’t know what to say about that  That was just much ado about nothing ”Gorman added that Rondo is “arguably  in my

“student growth percentile” is designed to measure the impact of schools   It doesn’t look at how well students are doing on tests  It looks at how much they’ve improved  The schools with high “student growth percentile” are the ones full of kids who are learning faster and improving more rapidly than their peers around the state  n t nJudging from the student growth scores  here are six of the schools that did the most to help students learn  across Math and English  in 2014  These aren’t necessarily the places with the smartest kids or the highest achievers  At UP Academy Charter School of Dorchester less than two thirds actually met the proficiency standards  At Henry K  Oliver  just one in four students is proficient in science or math  But students at these schools are seeing the biggest improvements on their MCAS scores   nOne caveat here is that a fair number of elementary schools don’t get student growth percentiles  because there isn’t enough information yet to make the calculation for younger kids    nThe idea is relatively straightforward  Let’s say there’s a kid who scores 250 on the third grade English test  A year later  when she takes the fourth grade test  you can compare her new score with other kids around the state who got 250 last time  If she does better  she’s growing  And if her school has lots of students outperforming their one time peers  that’s a sign that the school is making a difference The student growth measure was introduced in 2009 to help provide a more accurate assessment of classroom impact  The trouble with more familiar measures  like overall test scores  is that they don’t necessarily tell you much about the quality of schools  High test scores can also reflect the wealth of the surrounding community  the likelihood that kids get tutors  the educational background of parents  and other socio economic factors   nThey did more or less as well as as they did last year  The only exception was the eighth grade  where there was a a slight increase in science proficiency and a dip in math Looking back over the past few years  there’s been very little growth in the share of students who meet or exceed the grade level proficiency standards  nNothing substantial  Between rich and poor  white and black  the achievement gap remains quite wide    nFor years now  closing these achievement gaps has been a leading state and national priority  It would be possible to use the student growth measures to determine which approaches are working best  and then to spread those practices around the state   One place to start would be with the schools that seem to be doing the best job with low income students  n', '2014_394')",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"('Sean Bianchi positioned

convicted sex offenders like Febles who have failed to register with state authorities The unit was enacted under the mission of the 2006 Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act  and it has become increasingly active in recent years as federal officials ramp up efforts to target sex offenders like rapists  sex traffickers  those involved in child pornography and the exploitation of children

collaboration  too  saying efforts to apprehend violators “is vital to protect the citizens of Massachusetts ”“The law requires sex offenders to comply with registration obligations by providing accurate  updated offender information  which helps prevent further victimization of children and other vulnerable populations ” said Saundra Edwards  chair of the Sex Offender Registry Board  Since 2007  the Massachusetts based unit has arrested 565 people on warrants for failing to register as sex offenders  And those numbers have risen sharply in the last three years since the partnership with

council now that her own 5 year old is a student “Codman had this mothering role for me ” Ramsey said  “I wanted to give back  to work in a school that provides that to others ”What we have here is the fulfillment of a promise made when the school first opened 14 years ago  Codman Academy has never been just about getting kids through high school and sending them off to college  It concerns itself with its students’ whole lives  inside and outside of school  before and after graduation  Students here learn not just to ace tests  but to be leaders and value service  too  Their relationship with the school continues beyond graduation  with counselors who visit them at college and events that have alumni returning to join graduation processions and receive awards “When they graduate from Codman  we’re just getting started ” said Meg Campbell  the school’s founder  who is also a member of the Boston School Committee  “The culture is very strong here  and the alumni are stewards of it ”The charter school  attached to the health center at the heart of this neighborhood  is about building a community  And what better way to build it than with these young people  who could do anything  but chose to come back to the place that formed them  It is not unusual to see this at schools like BC High or Malden Catholic  where students connect with the school for life  It is far rarer to see this kind of thing in a public school in a poor neighborhood — where the power of such connections is most sorely needed “What better way to form a pipeline of strong  diverse faculty than to build our own ” Campbell said  She is convinced that each year will bring more alumni back to the school  They will make students sweat the way they did  Bonilla will demand  as her teachers did of her  that students re do presentations because they were merely good  not great  Head of discipline and National Guard member Sebastien Louis will push kids as he was pushed  into doing things he never thought he could do  public speaking and  “Twelfth Night ” Brewster will give kids grit  the gift his teachers gave him And the kids will learn those lessons  because some of

some of the most politically engaged parts of the city and has  historically  been a springboard for higher office James T  Brett  whom Walsh succeeded in the State House and who ran unsuccessfully against Thomas M  Menino for mayor in 1993  said representing the seat comes with enormous expectations from constituents  “People in the district expect you to do an exceptional job  that you move

speaker of the House and became the state’s attorney general in 1969  Former city councilor and longtime Boston political observer Larry DiCara said the challenge of winning a seat in a district where

So far this year  that number is 126  police said Gun buybacks have been a staple in urban crime fighting for more than two decades  but research has concluded they are largely ineffective  Criminologists have found that the buybacks have no impact on gun crime or gun related injuries and that the programs do not target the guns most likely to be used in violence MacDonald and other buyback supporters say the programs have played a part in getting weapons off the street In announcing the campaign  Boston police acknowledge on their website the lack of reliable statistics on the

180,,,,,,,,,"('A state Supreme Judicial Court justice on Monday refused to alter the gag order imposed by a Bristol County judge on prosecutors who are pressing the murder case against former New England Patriots star Aaron Hernandez Justice Fernande R V  Duffly ruled on the gag order issued by Bristol Superior Court Judge E  Susan Garsh  The order applies to both Bristol District Attorney C  Samuel Sutter’s office and the defense team  but only Sutter challenged the scope of the order  nHernandez  a former tight end for the Patriots  is being held without bail after pleading not guilty to a first degree murder charge that alleges he orchestrated the murder of Odin L  Lloyd of Dorchester in an industrial park not far from Hernandez’s home in North Attleborough Sitting as a single justice  essentially a gatekeeper for the SJC  Duffly wrote Monday that Sutter had neither shown that his office had been harmed by the order  nor laid out a convincing case that the gag order would hurt the way the prosecution operates in the future  n“The Commonwealth has failed to establish that the extraordinary relief available  to the SJC  is appropriate ’’ Duffly wrote  alluding to special powers the SJC has to change a judge’s order before a criminal or civil trial begins “The Commonwealth has shown nothing but speculative future harm should it or the defendant make  or determine there is a need to make  an extrajudicial statement concerning some as yet to be determined event ’’ Duffly wrote  Duffly also praised what she called Garsh’s “carefully crafted order’’ that she concluded simply took existing legal ethical rules and applied them to both the prosecution and defense in the Hernandez case “The order does not apply to potential trial witnesses  places no restraints on the media or on public access to any courtroom proceeding  and does not involve attorney discipline for violation of the rules of professional conduct ’’ Duffly wrote  Duffly also wrote that the prosecution can ask Garsh to modify the order down the road  if prosecutors can show it is having a negative impact on the case from their perspective In an e mail  Sutter spokesman Gregg Miliote said the district attorney was studying the ruling before deciding what the next step would be for his office  “The district attorney is surprised and disappointed ’’ Miliote wrote  “But he won’t be able to comment until he has read through the entire decision ’’Michael Fee  a member of Hernandez’s defense team  referred a reporter to the defense’s filing in the case and declined to comment on Duffly’s decision', '2014_600')",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"('ne was weary and hoarse  the ringing in his ears hard to bear When he stood at the head of his dining room table to introduce himself  he looked at his carefully chosen guests and faltered for a long moment  n“I’m Bill Richard  and I’m         ”He struggled for composure  A friend gently intervened  “You’re the dad ”He looked down  eyes filling  and then at last found the words that had become so difficult to say since his family stood by the barricades on Boylston Street  “I’m Martin’s dad ”As he welcomed family  friends  and others who knew his 8 year old son to his home in Dorchester  Bill passed around a piece of paper that ended with a question printed three times in capital letters “What do we want to accomplish ” nSeven months after what he came to call “the event ” Bill and his wife  Denise  were now grappling with how to glean some meaning out of their void  some way to honor their son  the only child among the three who died on Marathon day Bill was still recovering from a second operation to repair his blown eardrums  while Denise was learning to adapt to being blind in her right eye  Neither had much time for their own care  so pressing were the constant medical appointments for Jane  their 7 year old daughter  who lost her left leg and was still learning to walk with a prosthesis  They also remained concerned about their older son  Henry  who at age 11 escaped the shrapnel but had to live with what he witnessed It was the week before Thanksgiving  another looming milestone as they learned how to live on as a family of four  to use one less plate for dinner And it was still hard  even this long after the bombings  to contemplate sharing their story beyond their closest friends and relatives  No family lost or suffered more that day  No family was more determined to defend their need for privacy against the compassionate attention of the city  indeed the world  They deflected all interview requests until  in late autumn  they agreed to meet with the Globe But on this November night the Richards found themselves in something more like a familiar role  After years of organizing neighborhood cleanups  turkey fries  ice cream socials  pumpkin carvings  fund raisers  and local revitalization projects  they were again mulling how to give back to the community This time it would be far more personal  They hoped to start a foundation to build a lasting legacy for Martin  a boy who spoke out for fairness on ball fields and for peace in the streets Through the night  they debated whether to raise money to help amputees  build ballparks  or support libraries  whether to stay local or go national  The mission  they decided  should focus on the Martin who loved sports  memorized lines from Martin Luther King Jr ’s “I Have a Dream” speech  and once marched in an antiviolence rally with a poster whose message had become his icon  “No more hurting people — Peace ”“I feel that the path has been opened with him holding that sign ” Bill said “It’s his ” Father Sean Connor  the Richards’ former pastor  agreed “Claim it ” Others at the table  including Martin’s teachers  counseled the Richards to keep the mission broad enough so Jane and Henry could shape it when they were older In a room filled with gifts sent by strangers from around the world — quilts  flags  jerseys  stuffed animals — the discussion turned to what distinguished the Richards from others who had suffered a great tragedy  and how  their loss having occurred in such a public way  they would have to relive their experience every April “It’s unfortunate that Martin didn’t die in a car accident on a random night ” Bill said  “Martin died at the Boston Marathon  The Marathon is going to happen every year  and it’s going to be public  whether we like it or not ”So they would have to choose whether to embrace or escape it “We’re trying to be ready for April ” said Bill  noting that the upcoming Marathon would fall on his birthday Would they go  It was a question they weren’t ready to answer  The answer would depend on how Jane and Henry felt about it “You’re all here because we may decide we just want to get out of Dodge ” Bill told his guests But they were already feeling the pressure “When the door’s open ’’ Bill said  “you feel like you need to go through it ” n before everything changed  the return of spring meant more time for Martin to practice layups and slap shots in his family’s driveway  where he would drop his backpack after school and spend hours playing Jane went from piano lessons to chorus practice to Irish step dancing classes  where she was known for her giddy enthusiasm and diligence in practicing her favorite dance  the reel Henry focused on keeping his grades high enough to stay on the honor roll and worked with a tutor to prepare for Boston Latin School’s challenging entrance exam For Bill and Denise  both 43  there weren’t enough hours in the day  Regimented and focused on work  Bill was constantly meeting with clients and overseeing projects for the small environmental services company in Needham he had spent years helping to run  Denise  often nose deep in a book and with a deep appreciation for irony  was organizing themed story times as a librarian at the nearby Neighborhood House Charter School  where Martin was in the third grade and Jane was two years behind They were a family in constant motion  a whirlwind of pickups and drop offs  sleepovers and birthday parties  homework  community projects  coaching  and church  Their foyer was filled with cleats  hockey sticks  and baseball gloves  the walls of their house decorated with the children’s artwork and school presentations A steady flow of neighbors stopped by  as they always did  Bill and Denise were seen as pillars in their corner of Dorchester  Bill spent years as board president of the St  Mark’s Area Main Street group  and Denise served as secretary of the Ashmont Adams Neighborhood Association  The couple had become well known for their efforts to raise money to restore the old Peabody Square clock and renovate the Ashmont T station  among other projects In the days before school vacation  it was Silly Week at school  and Jane dressed up as Jane Goodall  with binoculars made of toilet paper rolls  and Martin went as Dustin Pedroia  his hero  Henry and Martin covered themselves in mud in a neighbor’s yard and went to scare Jane and her friends  a typical prank  The next morning  the kids competed in the Boston Athletic Association’s annual youth relay race on Boylston Street  a prelude to the Marathon  which they had done for years  Martin took the short sprints so seriously he’d hold his fingers taut — an aerodynamic edge On Sunday  the day before Patriots Day  Martin had baseball and street hockey  Denise and a friend took a deli platter to a neighbor whose mother had died  Bill opened a Sam Adams and settled in for a lazy day watching the Masters golf tournament  But then Martin wandered over and peered at him  his brown eyes wide  The sun had come out  and he wanted to toss a ball with his dad  After heavy persuasion  Bill relented  He rounded up a group  including Jane and Henry  and spent the afternoon playing pickle and baseball in Hemenway Park  where Martin complained if the adults let the kids win That night  after pizza  Martin and a friend at the house were pleading for a sleepover  but Bill and Denise were tired and the family had plans the next morning  Martin and Denise walked him home  It was a glimmering night  with the stars unusually bright  and they lingered on the way back  admiring the ethereal view Martin was studying the solar system and always looking for Venus  In his father’s fleece  the sleeves way too long  he held Denise’s hand as they walked back  leaning into his mother  “Is that the Milky Way ” he asked  n after they met at a keg party at Bridgewater State College  the young couple made a tradition of joining the throngs at Fenway Park who strolled to the Back Bay on Patriots Day to watch the final leg of the Boston Marathon After their children were born  the Richards carried on the ritual of cheering on the runners  though they would spend more time in ice cream shops than bars  When they got older  their kids — all fledgling runners — marveled at the elite competitors and cheered on the stragglers  while Bill and Denise relished being part of the massive crowds  which made them and the city feel so alive Last April  however  they thought it might be time to try something new  The Amtrak Downeaster ran up to Portland  which Martin  especially  thought would be fun  The weather was just right  and it would be a nice escape over school vacation  But in the end  Bill had too much work and couldn’t take off more than Monday So on the morning of the Marathon  there was a tacit understanding they would head downtown  Martin was up early shooting hoops and playing hockey behind the house  while Bill and Denise scrambled to get everyone ready  After breakfast  they packed pretzels  peanut butter sandwiches  apples  and water  and offered advice on what to wear  Jane  who could sometimes dress outlandishly  was testing their patience as she searched fruitlessly for her prized Clifden Academy of Irish Dance jacket They didn’t leave the house until after 10  and Bill was anxious to get to their regular spot on Hereford Street  worried they might miss the leaders before they turned onto Boylston  They were cutting it close “C’mon — let’s go ” he said  as he hurried to the subway About a half hour later  when they arrived at the station beneath Boston Common  Bill was ready to speedwalk  But someone had to go to the bathroom  and then everyone did Finally on their way again  Bill and Henry huffed ahead of the others through the Public Garden and down Commonwealth Avenue  more than a mile  until they made it to Hereford and realized they were too late  They had just missed the lead runners But they were there  and happy to be  The kids wormed their way through the crowds for a better view by the barriers  They cheered for strangers heaving up the final hill  a gentle slope that feels like a mountain to many haggard runners  When they had had enough  Martin and Jane began playing a jumping game on a nearby stoop  until Jane got tired and fell asleep while leaning on Bill Afterward  Martin began egging on his parents for ice cream  “Soon  soon ” they responded  as they craned to watch more runners surging through the final mile Eventually  they gave in  They planned to be there for the afternoon — Denise was on her iPhone  tracking friends who were running — and they had to pace the kids So the family made their way down Newbury Street  high fiving foil caped runners on the way  When they made it to Ben   Jerry’s  Martin smeared Moose Tracks on his face  laughed  and gave his family a big thumbs up  They lucked out  got a table inside  and Henry and Jane lingered over their black raspberry and cookie dough With the kids sugared up and content  Bill and Denise ushered them to Boylston Street  The crowds remained dense as many of the charity runners began slogging in after 2 p m   and the Richards strolled along the sidewalk until they spied a slight ebb in spectators by the Forum restaurant A couple was standing next to the barricades  but they let the kids in front of them  “Not you ” they joked with Bill and Denise  considerably taller With the sun peeking in and out of the clouds  they searched for familiar faces as runners streamed past  At one point  between high fiving runners  Martin asked his parents how old he had to be to run the Marathon Denise looked at her phone  refreshed the website with the tracking information  and couldn’t believe it  They had just missed one of their friends finish  It was 2 49 Maybe it’s time to wrap it up  Bill thought Suddenly  in the distance  they heard a deep boom and felt the ground shake  They looked to the left and saw a large plume of smoke rise a block away  near the finish line A utility explosion  Bill thought  Denise was staring into the distance  trying to make sense of what happened  The kids were silent  more surprised than frightened Someone in the crowd urged everyone to clear the sidewalk  “Get in the street ” the person yelled Bill was standing behind Martin and Jane  with Denise and Henry a few feet away  They converged as the crowds pressed toward the barricades “We should go ” Bill told Denise  as Henry retreated behind her Then they heard a young woman shriek “Oh  my God ” and Bill realized it might be something other than a mishap in a manhole  He began to jump the barricade and planned to hoist the kids over  He wanted everyone out of there quickly If this isn’t a utility explosion  he said to himself  there might be another  n  in an ambulance racing to Boston Children’s Hospital  Bill crouched between Jane and Henry  holding their hands  nThey all reeked of gunpowder Henry had bits of shrapnel — mainly nails — in his fleece  minor burns on his legs  and trouble hearing  He was quiet and his head throbbed  Jane was in a state of shock and had burns and shrapnel all over her body  Her hair was singed  When a paramedic asked her to sit up  she saw that her left leg  below the knee  was gone  She started to scream Bill had second  and third degree burns on both legs and a ball bearing lodged deep in his left shin  Blood covered his shredded jeans  His sneakers were torn  He could hear only faintly His mind filled with images too hard to bear  He felt dazed  and as the ambulance sped through the city  he repeated to himself  It happened  It happened When the ambulance arrived at Children’s  doctors and nurses were waiting in their surgical scrubs  They had been alerted that a young girl with severe injuries was coming  and they wheeled Jane on a stretcher to the emergency room as Bill and Henry followed on foot Bill’s cellphone rang with an unknown number  It was Denise  She was calling from a phone at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center  where paramedics had brought her  She told him what he already knew in his gut  that their son was gone  There was a pause  and then  “I know ” From her stretcher  Jane was talking while a medical team began to treat her  “Where’s Martin ” she said  loud enough for Denise to hear  “Where’s Martin ”Afterward  Bill felt obliged to pull Henry aside in a nearby corridor  He looked at his distraught son and explained that Martin had been hurt really badly  that he didn’t make it “Jane and Mom are OK  and we’re going to be OK ” he tried to assure Henry  who was now in tears While they waited for Jane to get out of surgery — doctors spent hours cleaning and closing her wounds  performing blood transfusions  and removing the shrapnel that scarred nearly every part of her body — Bill made several calls His first was to John Hernandez  his sister’s husband  who wasn’t picking up because he was squabbling with his accountant  Finally  Bill texted him  “I need to talk to you now ”Bill also called Erin O’Brien  his sister in law  who had been watching the Marathon on Boylston Street with her 4 year old daughter but left shortly before the attack  “Are you OK ” he asked  as she pulled into her driveway  Yes  she said  and you “No  we’re not ” Bill said John and his wife  Michelle  would be the first of many family and friends to drop everything and speed to the Richards’ side  After leaving their kids with friends and talking their way through a series of police checkpoints  they found Henry in the emergency room  where there were bloody bandages everywhere  There was fear and confusion in his eyes Bill was in an examination room nearby  pleading with a doctor to remove the shrapnel from his leg  but refusing to be sedated  “You’re not putting me under ” he said  an edge now clear in his voice  Too many decisions lay ahead to be unconscious  The doctor couldn’t reach the embedded ball bearing without proper anesthesia  so it would have to wait Father Sean  who was also a longtime police chaplain  heard the news from several parishioners at Saint Ann’s  where many in his flock are officers  nurses  and firefighters  He and others in the police department’s family assistance unit drove from the finish line to Beth Israel  where they found Erin and her husband  Sean  Denise was in surgery  with doctors laboring to remove a large ball bearing from her right eye Then Father Sean went to find Bill at Children’s  Rarely at a loss for words  he wondered as he walked into the emergency room  What do you say to a man whose world had suddenly shattered When he found Bill  the normally well groomed man was wearing scrubs and hospital socks  the ends of his graying hair brittle and burnt  They embraced in a long  silent hug  “I’m sorry ” the pastor said  “I’m sorry ”Before the surgeons moved Jane into a recovery room  an FBI agent and a Boston police officer questioned Bill in a private room  Did he notice anything  What did he remember  Could he provide a timeline He had little to offer When the doctors operating on Jane emerged from surgery and assured Bill that Jane was stable and that she would remain in a medically induced coma for a prolonged period  he knew he had to go see Denise  n late that night to a surgical unit on the fifth floor of Beth Israel  Bill held Henry tight and steeled himself for what they would find  He knew only that Denise was being treated for an eye injury They found her in bed in her room  The medical staff stepped out when they arrived  leaving the three to embrace  and to weep together in shock at the randomness of their tragedy  Jane grievously hurt  Martin gone  Henry almost without a scratch Denise had a thick bandage over her eye  The ball bearing  about a third of the size of her eye  had ruptured her eyeball and damaged her optic nerve  but she had escaped any brain damage  An out of town surgeon would fly back to Boston to repair her retina the next day  but no matter how much the doctors tried  she would never see again in that eye  not even shadows Bill and Denise had little time to dwell on their injuries  which seemed relatively trivial to them  Nor could they linger in sorrow  They had to rally for Jane  who remained in stable but critical condition  They had to comfort Henry  now noticeably withdrawn as relatives tried to engage him at the hospital Most concerning to them  at the moment  was where Martin was  A police sergeant had promised Denise  before she left Boylston Street  that his officers would remain with her son at all times  John and Father Sean were now conferring with police  and Bill told them he wanted to know as soon as his son was moved  They wouldn’t learn until later that his body remained on the street until well after midnight — roughly 12 hours — because the crime scene had to be documented in minute detail With others to stay with Denise and Henry at Beth Israel  Bill returned with Father Sean to find Jane in a recovery room at Children’s  She was unconscious  badly burned  and had a breathing tube in her mouth It was late now  The pastor said a prayer  Bill was exhausted and numb  He wanted to change and gather what they would need for the coming days  so John drove him home to Dorchester while Michelle stayed with Jane Inside the house  Bill was still carrying the backpack he had been wearing on the street  It was shredded by shrapnel  He began unpacking it in his kitchen  thinking  What the hell do I do with this  Do I ever want to see this again Then he removed his shirt  which still reeked of gunpowder  and dropped it and the backpack in the trash John went alone to Martin’s room and thought about the many Patriots and Bruins games they had watched together  Bill couldn’t join him  It would have been too much seeing his son’s flannel Celtics pajamas still on the bed  the comforter pulled up  He wanted to wait for Denise  He needed to stay focused on the moment Bill thought it might be the last time in a while he would be home  so he gathered clothes for Henry  underwear for Denise  and importantly  Doggy and Bunny  Henry and Jane’s beloved stuffed animals  They left the house and locked the door  Bill didn’t want to return until his family could come back together  It would be summer before anyone slept there again In the hours and days ahead  family and friends mobilized  Erin created a spreadsheet to schedule shifts to make sure someone would be at Jane’s bedside around the clock  Others helped them navigate the medical bureaucracy  take notes for them when Jane’s doctors visited  and entertain Henry with board games  They brought decent coffee and food to Bill and Denise  or  sometimes  just held their hands They also sought to protect them  At the hospital  John emptied nearby newspaper boxes so the Richards wouldn’t have to be reminded of the attack  and Erin once threw her body in front of someone trying to snap a picture of the family  With satellite trucks encamped near the Richards’ house and media from around the world clamoring for an interview  Larry Marchese  Bill’s college roommate and a public relations strategist  helped craft a statement and worked with a local public relations firm to plead with reporters and producers from every major network to respect the family’s privacy Twenty four hours after the bombings  Bill’s leg began to throb  He knew he had to get the shrapnel out When Denise fell asleep that night at Beth Israel  and knowing someone was with Jane  he reluctantly submitted to going under general anesthesia so surgeons could remove the ball bearing in his shin  Still feeling an urgent need to remain alert  his anger flared and he began to yell as the doctors at Beth Israel began putting him under  They urged him to try to relax “Relax ” he howled as the drugs took hold  “My son is dead  How can I relax ” n the Richards remained at Beth Israel  the doctors and nurses understood they were treating a couple who had suffered much more than physical wounds  They gave their entourage extra space  turned off TVs in the waiting room when they entered  and looked out for them in many other ways The orderly who brought Denise her food also offered hugs  A hospital social worker  who helped with a range of logistics  patiently heard them out as they groped with an uncertain future  Nurses cried as they combed out the blood matted in Denise’s singed hair  The hospital’s top doctors — one of whom brought them a book of poems — offered detailed explanations and set aside plenty of time to answer questions  On Bill’s 43d birthday  the staff brought a chocolate cake  Everyone on the floor signed his card A stream of public officials also came  including the governor and Michelle Obama  Later  Jane would refuse to believe that the first lady — one of her heroes  whom she had dressed up as the previous Halloween  wearing pretend patent leather heels and an Obama pin — had spent time stroking her hair and invited her to the White House That Friday  after the shootout in Watertown that led to the capture of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and the death of his brother Tamerlan  Police Commissioner Edward Davis and Superintendent in Chief Daniel Linskey came to the hospital to deliver the news  They were brimming with emotion  especially Linskey  who told the Richards that his nephew had played on Martin’s Little League team  the Rangers Bill and Denise weren’t following the news of the investigation  and didn’t really appreciate then the importance of it or the relevance to them  Neither were they bothered much when they learned shortly afterward that the surviving Tsarnaev had been brought to Beth Israel for treatment of his wounds They had other concerns  especially Martin’s funeral John called in his tailor  who visited the hospital to fit Henry and Bill for new suits  His wife went to the Richards’ house to find a dress for Denise  An eye surgeon had an optician bring Denise a large selection of glasses  because she’d lost hers on Boylston Street and could barely see with her uninjured eye  The optician drove to Rhode Island to get the prescription done in time Father Sean offered Bill and Denise a selection of readings and songs and made many of the arrangements at the funeral home John did his best to keep the funeral secret  He hired a coach bus to pick up family and friends at a designated location and asked the driver to surrender his cellphone  He had the flowers delivered in an unmarked vehicle and made sure police escorted the family to the cemetery “It was the worst thing I ever had to do ” John would say later  n Jane asked groggily After two weeks in the intensive care unit at Children’s  she had begun the slow process of waking up from her drug induced coma “We’re in the hospital ” her mom said Doctors had kept her in the coma to help spare her the pain of her injuries and the multiple surgeries to clean her wounds  With Denise now discharged from Beth Israel and Bill’s leg healing — some of his hearing had returned  though the ringing in his ears was getting worse — the Richards  including Henry  and a roster of relatives and neighbors took turns holding Jane’s hand and reading stories from her favorite books  Sometimes  she squeezed their fingers when they asked if she could hear them Her vital signs improved  and finally doctors began the long process of bringing her to consciousness They began by removing the breathing tube from her mouth  It produced spasms of nausea  which was brutal for Bill and Denise to watch  But she was now breathing on her own  a sign that her collapsed lung was healing Over the next 48 hours  Jane slipped in and out  She would open her eyes  look around  and fall asleep  Soon  she started singing along in a raspy voice to music they played on her iPod  everything from Taylor Swift to “The Sound of Music ”Jane’s awakening brought new challenges  She grew restless and wanted to move  She became aware of the pain  When nurses changed the dressing of her many burns  it was agonizing  And then there were the inevitable questions “Where are we ”“We’re in the hospital ”“Do you remember being at the Marathon ” Denise would say “Yes ”“Do you remember what happened ”Jane would think for awhile and give different answers  “I lost my leg ” she would say  “A man carried me to the ambulance ”In the beginning  she would often drift off to sleep after that  But as she became increasingly alert  she followed up with more difficult questions Bill and Denise discussed with social workers how to describe what had happened  They settled on using the word “explosion ” But Jane understood  and there was no need for euphemisms “I remember a bomb going off ” she said Then came the hardest topic  “Where’s Martin ”At first  her parents were vague Martin was hurt badly  they told her  The doctors tried to help him  but they couldn’t  He was hurt too badly Each time they had the conversation  it was like the first time  And then Jane would start sobbing all over again  n was about Jane  her injuries were plain to see  Henry  a reserved fifth grader  was known as the quiet one before the attack  Now  Bill and Denise worried about their son  and what he carried inside For nearly two weeks he had been living at hospitals  shadowing his parents  Now  they decided  it would be best for him if he returned to school  Bill met with the principal and other administrators at Boston Collegiate Charter School  who offered to allow Henry to take breaks during the day or keep something on his desk to signal when he needed to step out But the Richards wanted him to have as normal a routine as possible  They didn’t want to call extra attention to him or to what had happened  So his teachers and friends were coached to keep it simple and say things like  “Good to have you back  Henry ”A few weeks later  his parents even allowed Henry to spend three nights away — his first time at anything like a sleepaway camp — at The Farm School in Athol  A teacher on the trip texted the Richards updates and photos as Henry learned about life on a farm Henry seemed to be readjusting well  but his parents remained vigilant about potential triggers for the trauma he had experienced  They also worried how it affected him to see them cry  which they were increasingly prone to do  especially Bill For his part  Henry’s main concern seemed to be keeping up with his homework  Bill and Denise had to convince him that it was OK to put off some of his reading and math problems  His teachers cut him slack After they left Beth Israel  Bill and Henry began staying at a hotel beside Children’s  allowing Henry to spend more time with his sister  whom he insisted on seeing every day  even if she was asleep He continued to read her stories  caress her  try to make her laugh  and swab her chapped lips to keep them moist  even when her condition took a frightening turn for the worse  n after she awoke from the coma  Jane’s white blood cell counts spiked and her temperature climbed to 102 Her doctors found a fungus in her wounded leg  a potentially life threatening development that sparked concerns it could spread to her bloodstream  To excise the infection  they began discussing a more aggressive amputation — to above the knee  but that would have meant significantly less mobility for Jane The next 10 days were harrowing The doctors added an antifungal medication to her already powerful drug regimen They also brought in a special piece of equipment called a wound vacuum  which was rarely used outside military hospitals  Jane’s nurses had to learn how to operate it  and they once had to call tech support to ensure that the machine properly flushed her wounds  nThere were more surgeries as doctors battled the infection  each lasting between two to three hours  But by the middle of May  the infection had retreated  Jane was gaining strength again She began to take more interest in the professional clowns who sometimes stopped by her room and sang her favorite songs  A music therapist used a keyboard to help her play simple songs  and she had more energy to devote to speech therapy to help her retrieve words she struggled to recall Jane also started to take notice of all the gifts filling her room that people had sent from around the world — teddy bears  quilts  chocolates  candy  toys  and a lot of Boston Strong paraphernalia Soon  she was well enough to get fresh air and accompanied her family and nurses to Prouty Garden  a peaceful patch of green between the hospital buildings where the Richards found some solace As Jane’s strength increased  so did her curiosity  She wanted to inspect Denise’s eye  When her mom took off her glasses  she said  “That’s too bad  I’m glad my eye is OK ” She also wondered whether Henry had any permanent injuries  When a nurse or tech stopped in  Jane would tell them about Martin  how she lost her leg  and that Denise couldn’t see  “My brother Henry only got some cuts ” she would say  “but was hurt in his heart ”After 39 days at Children’s  Jane had survived 14 operations  the last of which included skin grafts from the sides of her thighs to cover her limb and prepare it for a prosthesis  There were other signs of recovery  Her hair  eyebrows  and eyelashes  much of which had been burned  were growing back In her last days at the hospital  finally able to wear her own clothes again  Jane drew cheers when a physical therapist helped ease her off the side of her bed and she stood up for the first time  The next day  she took several steps while holding parallel bars  at the end high fiving her reflection in a nearby mirror  n in June  the day Martin would have turned 9 Denise and Bill had decided to hold a memorial Mass at St  Ann’s for their son  which allowed them to thank many people at once for all the support  It was also a chance for Jane to say goodbye to her brother  They were so close that she wore his clothes  played baseball and basketball with him  They shared slushies and sometimes even danced together  She regarded him as the best dancer in the family  nFor the first time in nearly two months  Jane would be outside a hospital and see a lot of friends and neighbors  many of whom longed to hug her Some 800 people packed the pews  while others stood where there was space  The children’s choir sang  Martin’s friends and Henry read from the liturgy  Police and public officials sat in the first rows  and there were prayers said for the bombing victims and first responders When Father Sean went to the pulpit to introduce Bill  the silence was thick  nBill was comfortable speaking in public  but this was entirely different  especially after weeks of intensely guarding his family’s privacy  He asked Father Sean to stay near  in case he had to stop  in case he couldn’t hold it together With his hearing limited  Bill wasn’t sure  at first  if anyone could hear him  except Jane  who sat in her wheelchair beside the pulpit  making funny faces at her father  It was clear that whatever damage the bomb did  it had not changed her character  her sweet giddiness Bill spoke about how full of life Martin was  how much he enjoyed being with friends  how he was always willing to smooch his mom in public and tell his parents he loved them  He described how Martin always looked out for Jane  sometimes letting her win a game of 21 on the basketball court  Or how incredulous Martin was when Henry spent a day off from school reading a book He spoke of who his son might have become  a hockey goalie or mayor  a charmer and storyteller  a coach and a dad  Maybe even a marathon runner As cheated by fate as he felt  he spoke of how grateful he was for what they had left and for all the love from family and friends “We’re going to be OK ” he reassured the congregation  though he wasn’t quite ready to believe it  n to the gleaming Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital in Charlestown  There  the Richards felt like they could breathe more easily  that the intensity of the previous weeks had begun to give way to something that  by comparison  felt almost normal The cacophony of beeps and buzzers in intensive care was gone  and from the broad windows of Spaulding  they could watch sailboats glide across Boston Harbor Using a walker  Jane was now out of bed  spending hours in physical therapy and speech therapy and having meals with other young patients  There were arts and crafts projects with clay and putty  even an occasional party  She was eating ice cream every day to gain weight  It almost felt like camp But there was grueling work  She had to learn again how to get out of bed  brush her teeth  shower  dress  and use the bathroom — all with one leg Relieved of the necessity of always being at Jane’s bedside  Bill and Denise had time for themselves  Bill took walks around Jamaica Pond with his boss  who told him to take the year off and continued to pay his salary  So long focused on work  he now rented bicycles with Henry and brought him back to soccer  where his son scored his team’s first goal  It felt  as the ball hit the net  like a kind of divine intervention  And it eased one of Bill’s first outings back into the community  There were awkward encounters  Some acquaintances weren’t sure what to say to Bill and kept their distance  others came up and asked questions he wasn’t prepared to answer Denise took long walks along the waterfront and had lunch with friends and relatives who came to visit  She began reading again  using a Kindle to make the type larger  At one point  she even went for a run  As she loped across what seemed to be a straightforward  flat path  she missed seeing a low hanging branch and smacked into it  She smarted at the pain but also chuckled at the slapstick randomness of it  It was a lesson in her new visual limitations  but also a reminder that her old quick to laugh self was still inside As Jane’s rehabilitation progressed  she drew strength from other people who had lost limbs  who showed her their prostheses and pictures of how they were able to swim  run  and play sports  She did relay races in her wheelchair with amputees from a veterans group  She also met other bombing survivors  several of whom were also receiving physical therapy at Spaulding  When she met Marc Fucarile  a 35 year old roofer from Reading who lost his right leg on Boylston Street  Jane looked at him and said  “We’re the same ”Summer neared  and the staff at Spaulding prepared Jane for her return home  The Richards began to spend more time together outside the hospital  At first  that meant getting smoothies at a nearby cafe  Then they all went to dinner at a Mexican restaurant near the hospital When Jane went to the bathroom  plodding with a walker and bandaged limb through the dinner crowd  Bill and Denise saw the stares and curious looks  Jane was already well known in Boston  and they understood their anonymity couldn’t last  There would be many times in the days ahead when strangers would offer well wishes or prayers  and Jane would turn to her parents  “Who are they ” she would ask  “Why are they praying for us ”After dinner that night  they went for ice cream  As they sat outside enjoying the warm evening  there was a sudden boom in the distance  a deep  percussive thud that sounded just like the first blast near the finish line  It was the USS Constitution  docked nearby  firing a cannon Jane froze “Let’s go ” she told her parents  “I want to go ”“It’s OK ” Denise said  “It’s done ”“How do you know ” Jane asked Henry reassured her  “It’s just what they do ”But the words seemed hollow  and they took Jane back to the hospital  n before leaving Spaulding  the Richards received an invitation from city officials to visit the makeshift memorial to the attack in Copley Square  which had grown to become a global symbol of Boston’s ground zero It would mean a trip back to Boylston Street  well before they were prepared for it But the memorial was about to be dismantled for good  so they discussed it and decided to go as a family They went in an unmarked police car  eager to avoid the glare of the media  which was hovering on the perimeter  The officers  who had become close confidants after weeks of looking after the Richards  parked nearby and came up with a code word for Jane  in case she got nervous and wanted to leave They were greeted by Mayor Thomas M  Menino and Davis  the police commissioner  who gave the children police pins  There were other survivors there  and Bill and Denise shared hugs and brief words with them But they weren’t in much of a mood to talk For more than an hour  they quietly absorbed what had become a shrine  with hundreds of running shoes tied to metal stanchions  Marathon medals  Mylar capes  bibs left on benches  mementos that ranged from rosary beads to police patches  nJane wondered why anyone would leave their sneakers behind and thought they were there to find Martin’s shoes  Henry looked serious as he perused the hand scrawled notes  posters  and other messages  some of which were left by friends and teachers they knew  But he found all the pictures of Martin disturbing  How  he wondered  did someone get a picture of his brother’s First Communion For a family averse to attention  it was a reminder of how invested the world was in their pain  and how far they were from being ready to cope with that  n', '2014_263')",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

and volatility of police work  Boston Police Commissioner William Evans said Tuesday  Defense attorneys for the oldest teens — Woobenson Morisset  19  and his 18 year old brother Lorcen — painted a vastly different picture of what happened on Monday in that stairwell   t nEntering not guilty pleas for the two brothers in Roxbury Municipal Court  defense lawyers said police pushed Woobenson Morisset while trying to arrest him on a default warrant  an officer fell or tripped in the process  and chaos ensued as relatives moved in to aid Woobenson or record the scene in the cramped stairway  “I certainly don’t wish any officer to ever be harmed in any way  shape  or form  but I believe it’s possible that this version” — the one told by the Morissets — “is entirely correct ” June Jensen  Woobenson Morisset’s defense attorney  said in court  Video on cellphones confiscated by police could clear up what happened  she said  All seven teens were arraigned Tuesday  with the youngest five — four Morisset girls and a boy from the adjacent apartment — appearing in Boston Juvenile Court  In Roxbury  Suffolk Assistant District Attorney Dana Pierce said officers visited the Morisset apartment on Wayne Street late Monday morning to arrest Woobenson  He was wearing a GPS monitor because of three open cases in Dorchester Municipal Court  the GPS device signaled a “strap violation” on Dec  22  suggesting he may have tampered with it and triggering default warrants in those cases  Pierce said  Two officers found him in a rear stairwell  where a “violent struggle ensued” when they tried to arrest him  Pierce said  One officer got elbowed in the neck  suffering vocal cord contusions and hemorrhaging  and the other  a woman  took a punch in the face  the prosecutor said  without specifying who delivered the blows  In the process  police lost control of Woobenson Morisset and “from there on it was essentially a melee in a very narrow stairwell ” Pierce said  The seven teens  acting as a group  punched  kicked  and choked police  resulting in bumps and bruises to both officers and hand  head  and hip injuries to the female officer  she said  Jensen disputed that account  She said Woobenson Morisset  a 5 foot 3  125 pound Haitian immigrant with cognitive disabilities  did not tamper with his GPS device and did not receive a call from authorities about any violation  she said  So when police arrived to arrest him  he was surprised but complied  she said “He turned around  and they went to put the handcuffs on him and pushed him on the stairwell  He fell on the stairwell and his face cracked open ” requiring three stitches  Jensen said  “At that point one of the officers fell down  and the whole thing kind of got crazy ”She said Woobenson Morisset did not hit anyone but reached out to give his phone to his brother  apparently to record what was happening  Meanwhile  the 17 year old neighbor tried to record with his own phone because he thought the police were being rough  Jensen said  As more officers filled the stairway  they confiscated the phones and arrested everyone — the three males  plus the Morissets’ two sisters and two cousins — on and around the chaotic scene  Jensen said  Jensen and Frank Mickelson  Lorcen Morisset’s lawyer  said none of the teens besides Woobenson had been arrested before  Jensen said the charges in Woobenson’s three open cases — assault and battery with a knife  breaking and entering and assault and battery on a police officer  and attempting to commit a crime — could be explained by his limited cognitive ability  as he was led astray by another teen  The prosecutor said Woobenson’s record was alarming and asked Judge Ernest L  Sarason Jr  to set bail in this case at $2 500 and to revoke it on the Dorchester cases  which would have sent him back to jail  Sarason instead set bail at $500 and gave Woobenson until Friday to answer the Dorchester warrants  He released Lorcen Morisset on personal recognizance but imposed nighttime curfews and GPS monitoring for both brothers  In Juvenile Court  the five youngest teens faced charges of juvenile delinquency that involved assault and battery on a police officer  assault and battery with a dangerous weapon  and resisting arrest   according to Suffolk District Attorney Daniel F  Conley’s office  All pleaded not guilty  the 17 year old neighbor was released on $500 bail  while bail for the four girls  ages 13  14  15  and 16  was set at $1 each  Conley’s office said  The police commissioner  who visited the briefly hospitalized officers  said the female officer was “badly roughed up ” and the male officer had been fitted with a neck brace while waiting for the results of an examination   “They’re pretty banged up  They’re  going to  be out of work for some time ” Evans said  “It stresses the dangers of our job  every day  going into situations that we never know what may happen  I’m just thankful they’re fine ”',

friend  Felix Ungar  who moves in with him and turns his life upside down  Their comic clashes kick off the Playhouse’s 88th summer season  its first under the leadership of producer Mark Cuddy  For 19 years  Cuddy has been the artistic director of the  in Rochester  N Y   where the same production of “The Odd Couple ” directed by John Miller Stephany  played for four weeks in April and May  Now Cuddy — who also bears the title of chief executive of the nonprofit Cape Cod Center for the Arts  the umbrella institution at the Playhouse campus — is charged with reshaping the theater’s future  “The task for us is to set a repertory much like this summer  that is a blend of plays and some musicals  and really recapture the kind of dramatic legacy that was established for almost eight decades ” says Cuddy  Besides “The Odd Couple ” that means the recent drama “Freud’s Last Session ” the musicals “1776” and “Pump Boys and Dinettes ” the comedy “Perfect Wedding ” and the whimsical “Almost  Maine ” Except for “1776 ” they’re all remounts of Geva shows from the last couple of years  with the same directors — including Cuddy himself for “Pump Boys” — and some of the same actors  “The last thing I wanted to do in this first year was worry about the artistic quality of the six shows  I had to come in with sort of great confidence about that ” Cuddy says  Now he can focus instead on matters likeinstitutional strategy and community outreach for the Playhouse  which in some areas “needed to be dragged into the 21st century ” nHow much overlap there is with the Geva schedule in the future is yet to be determined  he says  but Playhouse fans should expect the mix to be similar “For almost 80 years   the Playhouse  did the occasional musical  but not predominantly  And it drifted in the last few years toward musicals because ‘Oh  a lot of people will come ’ u2009” Cuddy says  “But you know what  That’s just painting yourself in a corner  I’ve been doing this for a long time  and a variety of repertory is always better  like an investment portfolio ”Center for the Arts board president Richard B  Hawes Jr  is firmly focused on the future “We’re looking forward to continuing to enhance our reputation on the national scene as a summer stock theater that offers high quality productions ” says Hawes  “This  season  provides a wider variety of what we can offer the general public  and I think that’s going to resonate well ”The Cape Playhouse quickly became one of the hot spots nationally in summer theater after its founding by Raymond Moore in 1927  Its first production was “The Guardsman ” starring Basil Rathbone  Bette Davis worked as an usher before she made it onto the stage  Gregory Peck  Lana Turner  Humphrey Bogart  and Helen Hayes all trod the boards here  and in 1956  young Jane Fonda took a small part in a show starring her father  Henry The old summer stock circuit has largely disappeared  though  Under producing artistic director Evans Haile  who departed last year after more than a decade on the job  the Playhouse had concentrated on dependable musicals  Cuddy says that can turn into a treadmill  “You can still do fabulous productions of musicals  and I love musicals  but it really limits you ”Cuddy is a Dorchester native  a graduate of Boston Latin School and the University of Massachusetts Amherst  He and his wife bought a second home in East Dennis three years ago  A chance conversation with Hawes at a local coffee shop led to him giving a three hour workshop for the board in August on the state of the theater business nationally and the Playhouse’s place in it  By November  he’d been hired The Geva  he says  is the largest producing theater in that state outside New York City  with a yearly attendance around 150

two houses with 525 and 180 seats  while the Playhouse holds about 580  Joining Cuddy at the Playhouse  general manager Joseph Guglielmo arrives from ArtsEmerson  where he was director of audience

a good start with “The Odd Couple ” nOver the next year  getting McGrath for a two week run at the Cape Playhouse may come to look like more of a coup than it already does  For a year or so  he’s been attached to a “Honeymooners” musical project to play Ralph Kramden opposite Hank Azaria as Ed Norton  He expects that to move to a workshop in the fall and  he hopes  hit Broadway in 2015 “I think people forget just how great a writer Neil Simon is ” says McGrath  a Worcester native who will be staying at a family home in West Yarmouth  “And I think with every different production  you get someone who’s gonna keep those characters alive ”Perhaps because “The Odd Couple” has been seen in numerous iterations over the years  including the famed movie and TV versions  it needs no updating from 1965  McGrath says “It’s a classic play that lives perfectly in its own time ” he says  “We did a matinee for high school kids when we were up in Rochester  There were snickers about some prices

a few days after Martin J  Walsh was sworn in as the new mayor of Boston  his longtime girlfriend Lorrie Higgins strolled the short distance from her house to his  intending to start making dinner for the two of them  Glancing at the police cruiser stationed permanently in front of his trim gray house  she skipped up the steps and put her key into the lock It wouldn’t turn  She tried the other direction  Nothing  nAs she pulled the key out to make sure she had the right one  she felt the eyes of the police officer behind her  staring at her back  She tried the key again  with no success  Turning toward the cruiser  she called out sunnily  “Think he’s trying to tell me something ” The officer did not smile Higgins promptly got on her phone and called City Hall and within minutes the situation was resolved  Walsh’s lock had become loose a few days earlier and been replaced with a new one  But in the hubbub of the inauguration  no one had remembered to tell Higgins  With a new key extracted from Walsh’s mailbox in her hand  Higgins and the officer shared a laugh as she let herself in  But for Boston’s first girlfriend  it was the beginning of a quite different kind of life  one that the intensely private waitress and legislative aide is not entirely sure she likes It is rare these days that she gets to see much of Walsh  her partner of eight years  at all “I’ve lost him ” she said with a small laugh in a rare interview with the Globe  “He’s gone           He’s just so busy ”And when she does spend some time with Walsh  who routinely describes her as “the love of my life ” they are rarely alone  The mayor  for security reasons  is routinely driven by a police driver  Others  including Higgins  are not permitted to drive him  In fact  about the only place they can be alone  she quips  is “in the house  With the door shut  Close the blinds ” When they tried to walk the few blocks to a neighborhood restaurant on a recent Sunday morning  the police officer parked outside Walsh’s door inched quietly after them  and parked across the street while they ate breakfast “I said  ‘Oh my God  you are not allowed to go anywhere ’ u2009” recalled Higgins  “It was pretty funny          It’s hard to get used to  It is  That is the hard part ”Prying eyes even followed her to work  Higgins  the single parent of a 22 year old daughter  has long juggled two jobs  After Walsh’s victory  well wishers and the curious began to drop in at 224 Boston Street  the Dorchester restaurant where she has worked for more than 15 years  to get a glimpse of the first girlfriend  Taken aback by the press of interest  Higgins says she decided to take a temporary leave “I’m having a little hard time with it  yeah ” Higgins  41  sighed  “I mean I didn’t work there because it was fun  I worked there because it was a second income  And I also did enjoy everybody I worked with there          I do miss them ” nIf having the underpinnings of one’s life shaken were not difficult enough  there are now the ever curious reporters inquiring about her relationship with Walsh and many aspects of her life that she would  frankly  prefer not to discuss  Higgins is one of those rarities on the public stage  someone who adamantly does not want to talk about herself She agreed only reluctantly to an interview for this story  and Walsh  after making several requests that the story not be written  declined to speak more than briefly Although Higgins is clearly pleased about Walsh’s victory and worked long hours behind the scenes to help bring it about  on personal matters beyond that she is clipped  “I’m really not that interesting  I really am not  I’m very quiet  private  I work hard ” she said  “There’s nothing much more to say ”At a time when domestic partners are often regarded as akin to a spouse — many in the State House where she works refer to her as the city’s first lady — it may be difficult for Higgins to maintain quite the low profile that she prefers  But just what her specific role will be is  so far  unclear In other political settings  first girlfriends have opted for varying degrees of visibility  Former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg’s longtime partner  Diana Taylor  the state’s former banking superintendent  chose a relatively public perch and was frequently seen at Bloomberg’s side  Sandra Lee  the willowy celebrity TV cooking show host and author  who lives with  nGovernor Andrew Cuomo of New York  is a familiar media presence but almost always on behalf of her own causes rather than those of her partner Meena Bose  director of the Center for the Study of the American Presidency at Hofstra University  says that while voters are keenly interested in the partners of their public officials  they have come to accept that they may not always be publicly active  As Bose observes  “There are no clear cut rules on this  You can carve out a pretty large zone of privacy if you want to keep your life private ”To Higgins  struggling to regain her equilibrium these days  that sounds pretty good  Asked whether there are particular issues that would interest her if she ever opted for any sort of public role  she mentioned youth homelessness  Maybe she could get involved in that  But  then  maybe not “I might become more comfortable with that as we get further into the four years ” she said  “But it’s pretty brand new right now and I am trying to figure it all out ” nThey grew up breathing the same ocean laced air  children of Dorchester’s dense neighborhoods  defined by the perimeters of their parish  Walsh was the russet haired boy of St  Margaret’s  molded by strong talk and union men  Higgins was the amiable blond girl from St  Williams’ parish  known for her skill on the softball field  Six years apart in age  they drifted infrequently across each other’s paths over the years but did not fully connect until they were adults  both working in the State House For Higgins  the second of four children  the rhythm of life at home was determined in part by the demands of work  Her father  now retired  worked as an electrician at the VA hospital  Her mother worked part time at night for the former Bank of Boston  where Higgins herself began working when she was a high school senior  In order for her mother to get to work by 7 p m   all of them had to show up promptly at the dinner table “We’d all have dinner at 5 o’clock  She was like clockwork ” Higgins recalled  “She’d wrap up dinner and out the door she went ”So  too  were Higgins’s teenage years colored in part by her own work  Not that she wasn’t a social person  The popular Higgins was a regular at some of the Dorchester hangouts favored by teenagers of the time such as the Savin Hill woods and the tennis courts on Grampian Way  according to a few of those who knew her at the time Catholic  she attended the parish elementary school and participated in Catholic Youth Organization softball and basketball teams  Not long after she enrolled in 1987 at the Monsignor Ryan Memorial High School  a Catholic school for girls  Higgins began to work part time as a recreation assistant and receptionist at what was then called the Colonel Daniel Marr Boys   Girls Club  Mike Joyce  the club’s vice president of programming  remembers Higgins as “a really great kid  She was a real leader among her peers and well liked by the staff  She seemed able to get along with anyone  very outgoing  She’d share a laugh with anyone ”Another person who had spent time at the Marr was a young man  seven years her senior  who would significantly alter the course of her life — even if he didn’t remain in it very long  His name was Paul J  Campbell  then a friend of the not yet famous Mark Wahlberg  a dark haired rowdy who gradually built up a rap sheet of low level crimes  Years later  he would serve nine months behind bars  More recently  he had small roles in Wahlberg’s film “The Fighter” in 2010 and in “American Hustle” in 2013  “He was kind of the bad boy and she was the good girl ” recalled Jessica Broderick  a high school classmate of Higgins  “He was the boy she shouldn’t be hanging out with ” nShortly before she graduated from high school  Higgins found out she was pregnant  She was not  to be sure  the only girl in the school to find herself in such a state  according to a couple of her schoolmates  nor even the only one in her class  Although few who knew her were aware of her condition  those last weeks of school were a decisive period  The decisions she made then would shape the subsequent two decades of her life  Higgins says she never considered terminating the pregnancy “Nobody knew ” she says  “Obviously  it was difficult but it would have been a lot more difficult if she came along a little earlier  Thankfully she did not  But  yeah  sure  It was a difficult time ”Uncertain about college before she got pregnant  Higgins had been taking business courses in school and planned only on “going into the working world” when she completed high school  The summer after she graduated  Higgins increased her hours at  Bank of Boston  where she worked in customer service and continued to work there after her daughter  Lauren  was born “I changed shifts a lot ” she said  “I did three 10 hour days  Saturday  Sunday  Monday  Then I did nights  Then I did days as she got older and was in school ”In the beginning  Higgins tried to do it largely on her own  She lived alone with her daughter for about two years  But finding she needed more help  she moved back home for a couple years and turned to her parents and a close circle of friends for support  When her daughter began to attend school  she took on a second job waitressing and worked occasional catering shifts as well “You know  I am not going to say it was easy  It wasn’t easy  But I had family support  I had a core group of friends ” Higgins said  her eyes tearing up  “I did what I had to do  You just do it  You get up  you work  you take care of your daughter  and you just hope you get through the day the best you can  That is pretty much what I still do  Even though she is older  I am still doing the same thing  I just want her to finish school and have opportunities I didn’t have at that time in life ”Asked whether having a baby at such a young age altered the course of her life  Higgins pauses  But only for a moment  “If I didn’t have a baby  perhaps  Who knows what would have happened  I don’t really think about it  though  It was what it was and that’s life ”Higgins said Lauren’s paternal grandparents  in the past  were “very  very good to Lauren and me both ” Higgins said none of her family members or close friends would agree to be interviewed for this story  including her daughter who is a senior at the University of Massachusetts Boston  “We’re very private people ” Higgins said of her family  “I know life has changed and I date the mayor of Boston  but it doesn’t mean they do ” nThrough it all  Higgins has maintained an unwavering focus on her daughter  They have lived together for more than 15 years in an apartment in a pale green house on Savin Hill  now flanked by a sign reading “God Bless America” to one side  and a red  white  and blue campaign poster for Walsh on the other  The mayor lives a short walk away As Walsh describes the pair  “Lauren is her world  They have a special bond and love ”Over the years  Higgins and Walsh  who share a number of common friends from childhood  ran into each other socially at parties and family events  When he first ran for a seat in the state House of Representatives in 1997  she campaigned for him holding signs on the street and attending fund raisers and events on his behalf  In the years to come  she continued to pitch in on his campaigns “I just thought he was very genuine  very good for the neighborhood  very involved in the community ” Higgins said  “And also I knew him prior ”But not once did she ever consider him a romantic prospect “No  Never  Never  Nope ” she exclaims  “I just wasn’t          It just wasn’t happening back then  I don’t know why ”Nor was she particularly interested in dating anyone seriously in those days  she says  When one blossoming relationship did not work out  she said  she was just as glad to resume a single focus on her daughter “My main focus was just trying to raise Lauren to the best of my ability ” Higgins explained  “She was my number one priority in life  Marriage really wasn’t important to me ”So  too  did Higgins decide that college would have distracted her too much from her daughter  “Too much for me to handle financially and time wise ” she says  Instead  while Lauren attended school  Higgins continued to work at the bank and the restaurant In 2000  a friend suggested she apply for a job opening with the state Judiciary Committee  The friend had heard about the job from another one of her friends  then Representative Marty Walsh  who was close to the committee chairman  Eugene O’Flaherty  Higgins wound up getting the job of legislative aide  responsible for tracking legislation and handling constituent inquiries  which she has held for 14 years Committee members speak highly of her work there  saying that her orderliness and unflappable nature make her well suited to the job “When Lorrie walks in the room she is not looking for much attention  except maybe from Marty ” said Representative Russell Holmes  who left the committee a year ago  “She is discreet  She keeps her head down and she gets the job done  That is a good aide  And that is Lorrie ”It would take another six years  until 2006  before Walsh began to pursue her  At first  she dismissed his invitations to dinner and the movies  thinking he was just goofing around  But Walsh persisted  he recalls  “for a while  I dunno  Probably a few months ” Eventually  Higgins agreed to lunch at an Italian restaurant in Quincy Why she broke down in the end  “I don’t know ” Higgins says  “But I did  I went to lunch  In my mind I was thinking  ‘This is not a date ’ I kept telling myself that  ‘This is not a date ’ u2009”That non date led to another  and more after that  Within a few months  they were a couple  Walsh  46  seems deeply smitten  As he held her close to his side on election night  he declared her  “the love of my life and my best friend ” nHiggins says that part of the reason their relationship works so well is that the two of them have both been busy with their individual pursuits  In the beginning  she says  she was a preoccupied mother of a teenage daughter  “not having much time  But you know what  it worked out because he was very busy          We weren’t looking to spend every minute of every day with each other  So  it just worked for us ”In the days before Walsh’s name became a household word  the two had a fairly regular routine  During the week  they generally dined together twice  although Higgins always returned to her own home to spend the night in order to be with her daughter  On Friday nights  Higgins waitressed and Walsh went his own way  Saturday night and one day a weekend they generally spent together Raised a short distance from the shore line  they both like to go to the beach  They are also fans of Broadway shows and the Red Sox  This past Christmas  she says  he bought them tickets to an appearance of Prince at Mohegan Sun  where they spent the night  Higgins also shares Walsh’s keen interest in politics  She volunteered on behalf of  nJohn F  Kerry’s presidential campaign in 2004  and she has helped out a few Boston City Council candidates as well  When Walsh threw his hat in the ring for the mayor’s office  Higgins contributed behind the scenes at campaign headquarters many nights after work doing phone banking and mailings  In the final weeks of the race  she joined Walsh on the campaign trail  but admits  “I didn’t really love that part ”Over the years  Walsh developed a close relationship with Lauren and at times  Higgins says  “she got along better with Marty than she did with me  He had a way of getting through to her that I didn’t ” Lauren often encourages her mother to tie the knot with Walsh  saying  “just marry him ” But Higgins firmly says no  At least she has so far “I like to keep our separate homes and have control of Lauren and I really didn’t think or feel the need to uproot her in the middle of her teenage years to move in with somebody else ” Higgins said  “I didn’t want to do that ”When Lauren eventually moves out  Higgins says she might consider marrying Walsh  But she also points out that he has not asked her “We have discussed it ” she said  “But  no  there has never been an official proposal at all  That is false reporting ”Marriage is not something either of them is thinking about much now  It’s hard enough for them to get together for dinner these days  As they both adjust to the demands of City Hall  Higgins is trying to regain some sense of normalcy in her life  Or as political adviser Michael Goldman put it in an e mail  “To be blunt  right now her main concern is keeping as low profile as possible and trying to return to the anonymity that she enjoyed before Marty’s election ”Higgins understands that she needs to share her man with the city  And she is willing to be patient  At least for awhile “He tries but he’s too busy right now ” Higgins said  “He needs to be busy  He needs to figure it all out and get situated  If it’s still like this in a year  he might hear me complain ”',

kind of guy who belongs in jail  They’ve got the wrong person here ’’People who know Merrill say the alleged swindler in the headlines bears no resemblance to the man they’ve known and admired  Merrill  53  was arrested in May and held for six weeks in a Rhode Island jail as a grand jury was convened to investigate and prosecutors warned there was a risk he would leave the country — as his longtime business partner  Carlos Wanzeler  did Friends and relatives rallied to support Merrill  sending 32 letters to federal court in Worcester  Even the minister from his church wrote  A judge

to the court  “It just is not in Jim’s nature to harm anyone  and I really do not believe that was his  intention  or that he would ever try to accumulate wealth at the cost of anyone else ’’But prosecutors  as well as state and federal securities regulators  allege the two men oversaw an enterprise that could stay afloat only with an ever growing ring of promoters bringing in new investors who were eventually duped  nLawyers for Merrill and Wanzeler say the men did nothing wrong  They were running a legitimate business  their attorneys say  selling cheap Internet based phone service to immigrants with family in far flung places “Mr  Merrill steadfastly maintains his innocence ’’ said his lawyer  Robert Goldstein  He said he has offered “voluminous evidence undercutting the government’s contention that he has engaged in any wrongdoing ”As recently as March  when the alleged scheme was unraveling  Merrill assured a crowd of TelexFree promoters at a Boston hotel  “You’re going to get paid ’’ Weeks later  Merrill moved millions of dollars to himself and his business partners  prosecutors allege  just before the company filed for bankruptcy protection In court  prosecutors called Merrill the American face of TelexFree  He did not speak Portuguese  the language of Brazil  where the company had started  But they say he was greeted at business conferences around the world as a rock star  with music blaring and loud applause In an interview with state regulators  Merrill professed not to know all the details of the business’s structure  He could not say  for instance  why his 20 percent stake in the company rose to 50 percent in 2013  as Carlos Costa  their Brazilian partner  transferred his share to Merrill “It was a legal decision on his part ’’ Merrill said  “I’m not 100 percent sure of why that happened ’’ Merrill also said he did not pay for the added stake in the company In court  Merrill’s wife  Kristin  said she also did not know all the details of her husband’s work  She knew he had traveled to Brazil on TelexFree business trips but said she was unaware of the stature he enjoyed at company events In a letter to US District Judge Timothy S  Hillman seeking her husband’s release  Kristin Merrill wrote of a simple family life built on respect  honesty  “a deep  abiding love for one another and first and foremost  for God ’’ She said her husband would never abandon the family  in part because “Jim adores me  as my friends often remind me ’’Now  Merrill is legally in his wife’s custody  a condition of his release Merrill  called Jamie by friends and family  did not finish college  He is a son of teachers  born and raised in Worcester  with four sisters and a brother  Some people called him Max as a young teen  according to friends who wrote letters to the court  because Merrill was small and had to work “to the maximum’’ to keep up with his peers on sports teams He graduated from Doherty Memorial High School in 1979  where he was a member of the finance club  In his yearbook  he listed his favorite song as Bruce Springsteen’s “The Promised Land ’’ a rock anthem about a frustrated working man searching for something more Merrill went on to attend Westfield State University for two years but never graduated  Starting in 1981  he took “different sales jobs  nothing that worked ’’ he told state regulators investigating TelexFree  “I took some more classes at a community college that never really went anywhere  unfortunately ’’ he said In 1986  Merrill started Cleaner Image Associates Inc   an office cleaning business that grew to nearly $1 million in annual revenue at its height  That’s how Merrill met Wanzeler  who went to work in the business along with other family members in 1993  Wanzeler initially toiled as a cleaner for Merrill for $6 an hour  joining him later as a partner in the business Merrill was a tinkerer  inventing a button to unplug vacuum cords easily for his workers  according to a friend’s account  Later  he moved into telecom sales ventures with Wanzeler and the two eventually established another company  Common Cents Communications Inc   to handle the work  In February 2012  they changed the name to TelexFree  and money soon started flooding in Merrill’s biography on the TelexFree website says he earned a degree at Westfield  an inaccuracy he told investigators he repeatedly tried to correct  He said he even sent a rewritten version to Wanzeler and Costa because what appeared online was “horribly written  It’s embarrassing ’’ But the change was never made Court filings show Merrill started to make a lot of money from TelexFree last year  including $3 million around Christmas  The family remodeled their kitchen and improved the porch  but they still had a mortgage to pay  Wanzeler  by contrast  reaped $13 7 million in just over a year and spent millions on real estate  luxury cars  and boats Even as TelexFree grew  friends said  Merrill remained the same down to earth person they had always known  Trish Miller  owner of the Learning Center of Hopkinton  a day care center and longtime client of Merrill’s cleaning company  said he still jumped to help customers  even as he grew busier with TelexFree “If I had a problem he’d come right over ’’ Miller said  “You don’t find a nicer family or a man with more integrity ”In the court letters  old friends told of Merrill’s dropping everything to help empty their Quincy apartment after a fire  Others called him an empathetic listener who helped a friend through a divorce  a nephew said Merrill helped him stay on the straight and narrow Merrill visited his childhood friend Steve McManus in Dallas when he discovered McManus was dying of Lou Gehrig’s disease  After his friend died in 2007  Merrill raised money for ALS in road races “He did a lot for my brother ” said James McManus  Steve’s brother   “I’ll never forget it ’’Other friends talk about Merrill’s providing many jobs to immigrants  like Wanzeler  at his cleaning company  His wife would cook for the workers at their annual Christmas party But TelexFree ended up preying on the very immigrants the TelexFree’s founders professed to want to help  prosecutors allege  In Massachusetts alone  participants in the marketing scheme believe they are owed $90 million  according to regulators  Most of them live in Brazilian and Dominican immigrant communities here and throughout the country The scale of the TelexFree fraud was massive and global  prosecutors say  with as many as one million victims believing they are owed at least $1 billion  It created a tidal wave of transactions for TelexFree to process  Many large banks would not do business with the company  so Merrill went to smaller institutions  One of them was Fidelity Bank of Leominster  where his brother  John  was president  nYears earlier  John and James had stood together to give their father’s eulogy  John’s daughter called her uncle a hero in a letter to the court  nIt’s unclear how much John Merrill knew about his brother’s business  He is well known in the Worcester business community  an officer at the Greater Worcester Chamber of Commerce and a board member at several nonprofits  In his role at the bank  he was recently subpoenaed by state securities regulators  The bank has denied any wrongdoing  John Merrill has declined to comment to the Globe   nFormer lieutenant governor Timothy Murray  now chief executive of the Worcester Chamber  vouched for John Merrill  as his neighbor  He described the banker as a “next generation community leader in Worcester  A solid guy ’’As the pressure mounted this past spring  Merrill and Wanzeler assured their investors all would be well  even though TelexFree had been shut down by a judge in Brazil last year  But on April 11  Merrill and Wanzeler’s wife  Katia  went to a Connecticut bank to withdraw $27 million in cashier’s checks Four days later  Department of Homeland Security and FBI agents arrived at TelexFree’s Marlborough office with search warrants  Merrill was not there  according to court records  Wanzeler was in a car headed for Canada  where he would board a flight to Brazil It’s unclear if Merrill knew Wanzeler was leaving  Two years ago  at a company “extravaganza” in Brazil  Merrill called Wanzeler and Costa his friends  and “two of the greatest leaders I’ve ever met in my life ’’Today  those friends are far out of reach of US authorities  ensconced in a country with the roar of the World Cup in its ears  Merrill sits

experiment to improve care for thousands of Massachusetts’ sickest residents is proving more complex and expensive than health insurers and regulators envisioned  forcing the state and federal governments to shoulder more costs for the first in the nation program Called One Care  the initiative was designed to better coordinate health care services for about 95 000 disabled and low income adults under age 65 when it launched last October  But the state’s latest count shows fewer than 18 000 enrolled  and officials have repeatedly declined to release detailed information about the program’s finances or the quality of patient care because they say they want to be able to analyze a year’s worth of data first  t nOne of the three insurers managing patients’ care for the program said in an internal memo that the company was losing $1 million a month at one point  And executives at all three companies with contracts to manage patients’ care said even locating patients can prove daunting  often because of errant information from state regulators The experience with the trial so far opens a window onto the remarkably complicated needs of patients whose conditions include paralysis  severe mental health problems  and addiction  Executives from the three companies said they have been surprised by the extent of patients’ needs Robert Master  chief executive of Commonwealth Care Alliance  a nonprofit that oversees health care for about half of the patients in the One Care program  listed the challenges his company has confronted in connecting with patients  “The transience is extraordinary  behavioral health issues  homelessness       we kind of anticipated that  but we didn’t realize how bad it is ” nFor years  two massive and often conflicting government programs  federally run Medicare and state run Medicaid  paid the health bills for this group of patients But soaring health care costs nationwide  particularly for patients with complex medical needs  prompted federal regulators to announce a new initiative that aims to better coordinate patients’ mental health  medical  dental  and substance abuse services  hoping to avoid more expensive hospitalizations States were invited to design their own programs that combine the money from Medicare and Medicaid into one streamlined service that would offer better care for less money Massachusetts was the first state to sign on  and four other states have launched similar initiatives  with similar complications The program in Massachusetts scraps the traditional model of paying physicians for every blood test  medical scan  or other health service they provide  Instead  companies in One Care receive a lump sum each year to manage all of a patient’s care  often coordinating and paying for services not typically handled by an insurer  such as transportation  housing  and even food deliveries Robin Callahan  deputy director of Massachusetts’ Medicaid program  said the state didn’t have anyone to copy from when it launched One Care a year ago and said regulators are doing their best while learning as they go Callahan acknowledged that the state recently increased the amount it will pay to manage patients’ care to the three companies in One Care — Commonwealth Care Alliance  Fallon Total Care  and Tufts Health Unify  She said the state also agreed to share more of the companies’ losses for the next two years because of the large number of unexpected difficulties they faced But Callahan declined to release details  While only scant information about One Care has been released by the state  officials have disclosed monthly enrollment figures and preliminary results from a recent survey of 375 patients  That survey indicated 94 percent said they were “completely or somewhat satisfied” with One Care  but fewer than half said they had been connected with a coordinator to manage their services long term — a feature considered critical to successfully managing their care “This is a basic benefit that people are not getting ” said Al Norman  executive director of Mass Home Care  a network of nonprofit agencies focused on home based care  “Millions of dollars in public money have been invested in this experiment  We need full disclosure ”The lack of information has frustrated patient advocates  who say it is impossible without details about finances and the quality of patient care to gauge whether the program is effective and should be continued “Our concern is that people will say  ‘Where are the savings ’ and we will not have the information to say we anticipated losses in the first year  but here is why the costs are high ” said Dennis Heaphy  cochairman of both a disability rights coalition and an independent council appointed by state regulators to promote “accountability and transparency” in One Care Heaphy  a 53 year old Boston quadriplegic  is one of One Care’s biggest champions  Since enrolling a year ago  Heaphy said he has access to bandages that help prevent pressure sores from his wheelchair and bed  Medicare often balked at paying for the bandages because  under its complex guidelines  bandages used for preventive care were not covered  Heaphy said  One Care has also helped Heaphy get a hospital bed in his apartment and a machine that helps him cough “My health plan makes the guidelines now and goes with what the person needs  rather than some bureaucratic guidelines ” he said Leaders of the health plans say one reason they are facing such high costs is a lack of appropriate housing for patients with serious mental illnesses  Master  chief executive of Commonwealth Care Alliance  said his plan often has as many as 60 people in psychiatric hospitals at a cost of $1 100 a day  when many of them would be better served in community based crisis stabilization units at half the cost  But there are few such units in Massachusetts An August memo from Master to staff members said their company was losing about $1 million a month because of this problem  So the company is creating its own units and opened its first in October in a renovated floor it leases at Carney Hospital in Dorchester  A second is slated to open in January in a renovated Boston Victorian Master said the company’s significant losses have eased since August  but he declined to share details “I think we are going to come out of the year with manageable losses ” Master said  But “we do not think we will get to break even until 2016 ”Creative approaches have sprung from the obstacles confronted by the health plans  particularly in tracking down homeless patients  The plans are required to complete a comprehensive assessment of each patient within 90 days of enrollment “Part of the challenge here is  how do you come up with highly customized care for members that meets their needs  but do it in a way that you can produce data and that gives us reproducible outcomes ” said Dr  Christopher “Kit” Gorton  president of public plans for Tufts Health Unify Tufts officials noticed that while the homeless are not inclined to visit a clinic  they are diligent about filling prescriptions  So the insurer started leaving notes that pharmacists hand to patients telling them a nurse wants to meet to talk about their health  That has helped Tufts complete face to face assessments with at least 80 percent of its enrollees  Gorton said Fallon has had better luck catching up to homeless patients in the hospital “If someone is hospitalized  staff get up and drive over to see them ” said Dr  Dan Rome  a medical director at Fallon Total Care  which manages care for about 6 100 patients  n', '2014_299')",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

about hockey games  and hot cocoa vendors  and a Government Center Zamboni to keep the ice smooth “The vision is to bring City Hall Plaza something that people can use during the wintertime when it’s desolate ” said Ken Brissette  Boston’s director of tourism  sports  and entertainment  “We like the idea ”The seasonal rink has been under discussion since May and is in the early stages of securing permits  Brissette said  It would be a city sponsored amenity constructed and managed by Anthem Entertainment  a Boston company  The rink could operate from mid November through February or March  depending on weather City kids would skate for free and adults would pay a fee  Brissette said  There would be hockey games and concessions  Brissette said  although he did not have specifics about food and drinks “The city is excited about this up and down  and we’re excited about it ” said Chris Sinclair  president of Anthem Entertainment  “But we’re still dotting the i’s and crossing the t’s ”The initiative still needs a slew of permits from city agencies and sign off by an engineer that the plaza could support the weight of the rink  Brissette said the city was still seeking financing and could not accurately estimate a cost “This is not a done deal ” he said  “We hope it’s going to happen  We’ll probably know that within a week or two ”The ice rink is part of a larger effort by

their blog Monday night  t n“The victims in two or more of the cases indicated that they had utilized the Uber app to secure transportation ” said Officer James Kenneally  a police spokesman As of Tuesday night the three incidents did not appear to be connected  Kenneally said Uber officials could not confirm any connection between the company and the assaults  according to spokesman Taylor

Columbia Road using a ride sharing service  After entering an approaching vehicle  the driver offered her money and “touched her inappropriately ” according to police The victim then received a text from her assigned ride sharing driver saying that he had arrived to pick her up  so she demanded that the driver of the vehicle she was in stop and allow her to get out  police said Later  at 2 34 a m   another woman reported being assaulted by a driver whom she believed was working for a ride sharing service  police said  That victim had arranged to be picked up on Commonwealth Avenue and taken

labeled their lack of transparency and regulation a public safety issue The new set of rules proposed by Patrick’s administration would require employers at ride sharing companies to conduct national

for diversity — he’s a white guy — but he had time to do a count  so he did And he found that women and people of color are underrepresented as playwrights and directors in Boston theater in comparison to their numbers in the general population  nBy his count  posted on   writinglife3 blogspot com   women wrote 39 percent of the plays being produced by Boston area theaters  large and small  in the 2013 14 season  Women are directing 40 percent of those plays But women make up 52 1 percent of Boston’s population  according to the 2010 Census  “It’s not hard to say — when you look at the total number of plays being done in Boston  and you’re saying maybe 40 percent are written by women — that we’re still falling short ” Gabridge said  nPeople of color wrote about 11 percent of the plays and are directing 10 percent of them  according to Gabridge’s survey  But according to the Census  African Americans make up 24 4 percent of Boston’s population  Hispanic or Latino people make up 17 5 percent  and people of Asian descent about 9 percent  “We’re a chunk away from parity  for women especially  For people of color we’ve got a long way to go ” Gabridge said But the statistics are just a way of measuring progress  “When the numbers show us we have equitable representation of women and minorities on stage  it shows that the necessary people are being involved in creating the art  and we’re getting voices heard that weren’t previously heard “It’s a basic issue of fairness and justice  When you’re looking at the workplace and clearly there are barriers to  some people  being able to work  then we need to find ways to stop that happening ” Gabridge said Boston’s theater community has long talked about racial and ethnic diversity  particularly in regard to actors  But recently questions about women’s place in theater have moved back into the spotlight “Most people are like  ‘Eh  we’re doing OK on gender  we don’t need to pay attention to that ’ And in fact we’re not doing OK on gender ” said Ilana Brownstein  director of new works at Company One Theatre and founder of the grass roots group Playwrights’ Commons  “I’m lucky  I have been produced  and I’m really grateful for all those opportunities ” said Lila Rose Kaplan  a Cambridge playwright with works produced by the American Repertory Theater Institute and Fresh Ink Theatre Company this season  “But the numbers are pretty stark when you look at gender parity in production and people of color in production ”The theater community service organization StageSource has scheduled a town hall meeting for April 26 to talk about defining gender parity and finding ways to move forward  Roles for actors of color has been a more common topic in recent years  Many nod to the Lyric Stage Company of Boston’s embrace of diverse casting in all its shows this season  Which playwrights get produced is a trickier topic “In the arts  by definition we are empathetic ” said StageSource executive director Julie Hennrikus  “We think we can put ourselves in somebody else’s place — that’s what theater is  It is a powerful moment to realize that you don’t always have the complete perspective to tell a story ”She cited Lenelle Moise’s “Expatriate ” about an African American artist trying to find her path  as one such play that derives from the playwright’s own experience and place in the world The town hall  like Gabridge’s survey  arose in part from the fallout from a now infamous event in Washington  D C   known simply as “The Summit ” The Feb  17 panel discussion organized by Washington Post theater critic Peter Marks featured an all white panel of D C  theater artistic directors  four men and a woman  Theater people around the country learned about it through live tweeting  and the event prompted a heated online discussion of diversity and gender in choosing plays  Afterward  Brownstein used a Web service called Storify to create  that would be easily accessible to all  Various blogs and other journals weighed in around the country  as did theater artists on social media “The gender parity issue is really tiring to still hear about  It just seems like every three years or so  a big discussion happens around gender ” says Obehi Janice  a Dorchester playwright and actress  “What’s helpful about this round are things like Storify where we can archive what people are saying in real time  so it’s on a public record ” Gabridge said The Summit “really put the fire to me ” prompting him to run the numbers locally  He started going to theater company websites and taking notes  building on a much smaller count he did in 2010  He noted his method was not scientific  and he’s had to tweak the numbers a few times   ArtsEmerson was excluded from his count  as it is a presenting organization that sometimes co produces with local companies already on his list  He also left out the Boston Theater Marathon  But he tallied 151 plays produced by 48 Boston area theaters in the 2013 14 season  And by his count  59 of those plays were written by women  39 percent  and 16 were written by people of color  11 percent   For directors  the numbers were almost identical  Gabridge also broke out numbers for new plays alone  He counted 47 world premieres at Boston area theaters  more than three quarters by local writers  And 20 of them were written by women  43 percent   10 by people of color  21 percent   With a post last weekend  he expanded his count to include companies around New England  and the news wasn’t any better Two of the Boston area’s most prominent companies — the American Repertory Theater and especially the Huntington Theatre Company — offered significant diversity  as did Company One Theatre  The fringe companies as a whole fared worse  Women outnumbered men in a few places in Gabridge’s survey  Four of the Huntington’s seven productions this season were directed by women  All four of Company One’s productions were written by women  three of them people of color  Diversity is reflected among the Huntington’s playwriting fellows  with Lydia Diamond  “Stick Fly”   Kirsten Greenidge  “Splendor’   and Melinda Lopez  “Becoming Cuba”  among the notable successes  Company One and the Boston Center for the Arts run the XX PlayLab to develop plays by women  including a June 6 workshop of Janice’s “Fufu   Oreos ”“I see glimmers of hope  and we just have to keep digging for those  But yes  it is frustrating and slow ” said Janice  “To be honest  the conversation does tire me out  because it’s just reflective of who’s producing the work  which is mostly white men ”Somerville actress Erin Eva Butcher started the Maiden Phoenix Theatre Company with female friends last year  “Our mission is to tell women’s stories  past  present and future   and  have at least 50 percent female involvement in all aspects  onstage and off ” said Butcher  who is artistic director They’ll mount their first full production  “Playhouse Creatures” by April De Angelis  at the Factory Theatre in August  under the direction of Anna Trachtman  The play tells the story of the first actresses allowed to take the stage in England in the 1600s  There are roles for six women and two men  Too often  Butcher said  women are relegated to subordinate roles as “the wife or the girlfriend or the mother” of a male protagonist  “What we’re trying to do with our company is make the woman’s story the protagonist’s story ” she said  “to show the things women go through and be the lead for once ”', '2014_195')",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

matter  Mel — a good  decent guy   doesn’t get enough credit either  t nThe city was less than 10 years removed from the ruinous unrest that followed a deeply flawed school desegregation plan  and Ray Flynn  coming from the heart of Southie  where bigots threw bricks at school buses carrying terrified black kids  was able to bring the decent majority to the surface Unlike so many career politicians  Ray never enriched himself  He’s still down that little street off Marine Road  He doesn’t have a place down the Cape or a lakefront house up in New Hampshire  He and Cathy just have their house in Southie And for all Ray did as mayor  his greatest act as a human being may be what he is doing right now  every day  loving and caring for his disabled grandson  He and Cathy are good people One possible way to honor Ray Flynn is to have a statue of him and Mel King shaking hands  as they did many times during that pivotal campaign some 30 years ago  It would be a great symbol for the town But I’ve not come here to praise Flynn and King as much as to ask why so many statues and memorials are reserved for politicians  The simple answer  of course  is that the people who so often propose these things  and have the leverage to deliver them  are politicians themselves Still  as much as I like certain pols  the inescapable reality is that most of their greatest accomplishments are achieved by spending other people’s money Why don’t we have more statues and memorials for ordinary people who do extraordinary things Why not put up a statue of the Tuskegee Airmen who came out of Roxbury and Dorchester  There’s already a bridge in Dorchester dedicated to them  but I’d love to see a statue of guys like Willis Saunders and Harvey Sanford and James McLaurin and Donald Callender and Joe Hall and DelBrook Binns  Put it right in the middle of Grove Hall I’d put up a statue on Meetinghouse Hill of Walter Fahey  late of the Boston Police Department  one of the best cops to ever wear a badge  He gave back his detective shield so he could go back on the street  and  at 65  was chasing some guy with a knife through Fields Corner a couple of weeks before he retired  That’s when he wasn’t bringing food to homeless people all over the city  A saint Speaking of saints  what about Kathe McKenna  With what she did at Haley House in Dudley Square  she’s a modern personification of Dorothy Day Or Sister Mary Hart  Sister Mary  who died a few years ago  got hundreds of poor kids from Roxbury into college  When she couldn’t walk anymore  she did her business out of the back of her car  The kids still ran to her and hugged her Sister Mary deserves a statue more than any politician How about one for Ray Tye  who spent millions on kids from all over the world to give them access to medical care they couldn’t get at home How about a statue for Don Rodman  Or Bill Reilly  Great Dorchester guys who never forgot where they came from I’d put up a statue of Dr  Tom Durant  another OFD  originally from Dorchester   Doc Durant helped more refugees around the world than anybody I’d like to see a statue of David Mugar on the banks of the Charles  You could put up one of Jack Connors on Long Island  where he set up the camp for city kids  Norman Leventhal  who built some of the city’s signature buildings and is a great philanthropist  would be a good statue  surrounded by

of boarding school buses  4 500 12  and 13 year olds will receive passes to ride the MBTA to school This plan requires budget approval by the Boston City Council  and several councilors have raised significant concerns about its shortfalls  Since the MBTA is not planning to increase service  T riders may find themselves acting as de facto chaperones on more crowded buses  trains  and subway platforms   t nThe most significant problem  however  is one of educational opportunity  This transportation plan  coupled with the new student assignment system  will force some families to choose between the school to which they want to send their child and their child’s safety getting there and back  This is a choice no parent should have to make Parents rightly fear their children would risk increased exposure to bullying  harassment  and violence on public transportation  City Councilor Tito Jackson  for example  has said he has broken up after school fights between youths at Dudley Station  And there are tragic examples of more serious violence on the T  In 2012  a man in his 20s was fatally stabbed exiting a bus near the Dudley library in mid afternoon While all seventh and eighth graders would be affected by this plan  our most vulnerable students will feel the greatest burden  Residentially  Boston is a racially and socioeconomically segregated city  The majority of BPS students are children of color living in Roxbury  Dorchester  and Mattapan  neighborhoods with the highest concentrations of poverty in the Commonwealth  The new student assignment plan was intended to give students more options for attending high performing schools closer to home  However  children in high poverty neighborhoods must travel much farther than children in more affluent areas to attend a high performing school  due in no small part to the district’s school closure decisions   often through areas with comparatively higher crime rates  Asking these students to rely on public transit puts them at unnecessary risk  This risk is not alleviated by the promising attendance statistics on middle schoolers currently riding the T  Many of these students attend Boston Latin or Latin Academy  often using “supplemental” MBTA buses that bring them right to the school’s door  Nor is the risk limited by simply placing more police on the T  MBTA police should not serve as after school disciplinarians of adolescents  not when a first time arrest doubles the odds that a student will drop out of school  BPS representatives have said that other major cities  including Chicago  rely on public transportation for their students  But last December a 15 year old in Chicago was raped and beaten while walking to a bus stop  Violence on school routes is so bad that the state is trying to impose busing on certain routes so that children can get to school safely  Chicago represents a failed experiment  not a model for Boston Last month was the 60th anniversary of Brown v  Board of Education  In filing Brown  parents fought to secure a quality education for their children  which was being denied them in “separate but equal” schools  Boston’s transportation plan creates a new barrier between low income families and high quality schools  their child’s safety  Forcing families to choose between school quality and student safety will only serve to further separate our children into racially isolated schools as families opt to keep their students close to home rather than send them on the T The City Council has the opportunity to stop this plan from going forward  If it values the safety of Boston’s children  it must reject the BPS budget proposal  BPS estimates its transportation plan will help save $8 million amid $107 million in cuts  Our

have no direct evidence that Jenkins lied while testifying before a grand jury investigating the death of Lloyd  a Dorchester resident who was dating her sister  t n“There’s got to be more than

District Attorney William M  McCauley said that Jenkins has lied to investigators from the start and that her false statements were apparent to grand jurors “The improbabilities  the internal inconsistencies  the gaps — there clearly was a basis that  grand jurors  could find that she was lying ” he said Hernandez and two others have been charged with killing Lloyd on June 17  2013  and have pleaded not guilty  All are being held on bail  Lloyd’s body was found in an industrial park near Hernandez’s home in North Attleborough During a hearing in the Fall River division of Bristol

coconspirator Ernest Wallace  about her knowledge of the number of guns kept in the home she shared with Hernandez  and about her statement that she did not remember where she had disposed of a box she got from the basement Bassil said Jenkins truthfully testified she only saw one handgun  which she ordered Hernandez to remove from their home  She also said prosecutors appeared to have based part of their perjury charge on grand jury testimony from “cleaning ladies ”“The idea that Miss Jenkins is completely aware of all these guns in this house — there is no evidence of that ’’ Bassil said The women said they saw a gun in the pocket of a pair of pants belonging to Hernandez  in a sock drawer in Hernandez’s closet  and underneath a mattress in a guest room in the basement that Hernandez used as a “man cave ” Bassil said The women also said an object they believed to be a gun was covered by a blanket and stored in a downstairs closet  Bassil said  She said that there is no evidence that the women told Jenkins about the weapons Bassil also said one of the women considered Jenkins to be “snobby and lazy ”She also submitted 34 images taken from video surveillance cameras inside the couple’s home showing Jenkins and Hernandez one night in June 2013 before Lloyd was killed Bassil said the images showed Hernandez trying to hide from Jenkins that he was holding what might have been a gun McCauley countered Hernandez was in fact holding a firearm and made no effort to hide it from Jenkins  but rather tried to conceal it from a babysitter “The hiding is because the babysitter is sitting on the couch ” he said  “When of course he sees the babysitter  now he begins to shield it from your view ”Garsh took the defense request to throw out the perjury case under

touring far and wide  from the Apollo Theater in New York City to stages in London  Mr  Cook took a liking to Boston and settled in Framingham  His confidence was immediately apparent in the late 1970s when he approached the Cantab’s owner  Richard Fitzgerald  n“He told me he could put the place on the map if I gave him a chance ” Fitzgerald recalled  “He started playing one night a week and he brought people in  so I gave him more nights ”Eventually  Little Joe Cook and his band  the Thrillers  built up to full gigs Thursday to Saturday nights  and Mr  Cook ran the jam sessions there on Wednesdays and Sundays “He ran great jams for years ” said drummer Sir Cecil  noting that many local luminaries such as Silas Hubbard Jr   “Earring” George Mayweather  Sax Gordon  Big Jack Ward  and Pat Benti played at the gatherings Mr  Cook could be tough on musicians  though  according to Diane Blue  who succeeded him at the Cantab “He would encourage people to get up there  but he was old school ” she said  “If you made a mistake or didn’t get the groove right  he would get you off the stage ”Such was his fame at the Cantab that the city of Cambridge named a square for him  but he never gave up trying to expand his fame “You know  I get asked all the time if I feel like I should have been a bigger star ” he told the Globe in 2012  “I tell ’em yes  But on the other hand  I’m the Legendary Little Joe Cook  Everything works out the way it’s supposed to  so I’ve been exactly who I needed to be ”Richie Sarno  a local filmmaker who made a documentary about Mr  Cook  said his close friend “was never bitter about it  He was happy with who he was ”Mr  Cook also had a gift for uniting and diversifying the crowds that came to see him sing  “When we first went into the Cantab  it was all white audiences  and then eventually blacks would come in ” said his longtime guitarist  Candido “Candy” Delgado  “They’d each go to one side  but then they would all mingle  Joe loved all people ”Mr  Cook kept the Cantab vibe going by writing the song “Down at the Cantab” with its line  “that’s where it’s at          yeah  yeah  yeah ”When he was on stage  he lightened the mood by referring to the men in the crowd as “hamburgers” and the women as “cheeseburgers ”A memorial gathering will be held for Mr  Cook at 4 p m  Tuesday in Burke   Blackington Funeral Home in Newton  Mr  Cook  whose life and career will be celebrated with a memorial jam session at the Cantab at 9 p m  Sunday  was once asked for the secret of his longevity “I don’t drink  I don’t smoke  and I get all my energy from the fans ” he told the Globe in 1998  “They’re the best medicine for me ”', '2014_751')",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"('Two Boston firefighters who died

inside “Committing to serve the public by rushing into harm’s way for others is an act and a matter of character ” said Patrick  “That’s why it’s not surprising that many of those honored today were

 his father showed up on the fire engine with Captain David Farrell  who was also honored Tuesday  and they kept the tank cool to prevent it from exploding  which would have endangered a housing complex for the elderly and a fully occupied high school  Both men were on duty  and the elder Driscoll said he was very surprised to see his son at the fire  Off duty firefighter Richard M  Smith  who was also honored Tuesday  arrived and confirmed that the propane was shut off Michael Driscoll said he was thinking about retiring before his son joined the department  But then  he said  he decided to stay until 65  Whenever he’s not working  he listens to the fire radio to keep track of his son  he said  And whenever Jarrod Driscoll is off duty  he listens  too — and often shows up at

killing his teacher  Colleen Ritzer  on Oct  22  2013  in a school bathroom and moving her body in a recycling bin into nearby woods  prosecutors have said  He is also charged with aggravated rape  He has pleaded not guilty and is being held without bail  t nIn a motion filed in Essex Superior Court in Salem this week seeking suppression of the evidence  Chism’s defense attorney  Denise Regan  wrote that her client was never properly given his Miranda rights  that he invoked his right to remain silent  and that police manipulated his mother into encouraging him to speak with them early on the morning of Oct  23  2013 In an e mail  Essex District Attorney Jonathan Blodgett’s spokeswoman Carrie Kimball Monahan declined to comment on the Chism filing  “We will make our arguments in court at the appropriate time ” she wrote With Chism’s mother in the room  two detectives asked Chism if he wanted to speak with them  “Ah  not really ’’ he replied  according to the defense motion Police turned their attention to his mother  telling her that they were counting on her to persuade her son to share what he knew about Ritzer  who had been reported missing several hours earlier after not returning home from the school  where she was a popular math teacher After first saying she wanted her son to have a lawyer  Diana Chism changed her mind  the defense said “You make the decision ’’ Diana Chism allegedly told her son while he was sitting with hands cuffed behind his back at the Danvers police station   “Do you want to talk ”She also gave her son her “permission” to speak to police  who had told her they were still searching for Ritzer  who had been reported missing about 9 p m  on Oct  22 “If you want to talk  you can talk ’’ she said to her son  the documents stated “I

interview made by police  Chism’s answer to his mother represented the second time he had refused to speak with police  the defense argued But after a few moments  Chism changed his mind and agreed to speak with police — with the condition that his mother not be in the room  “Do I have to talk while she is in the room ’’ he asked police  according to the motion According to the defense  both Chism and his mother eventually signed a form marked “Juvenile Waiver of Miranda Rights’’ and answered questions from police  pointing out some locations on a map and a photograph he was shown  “Without giving me any choice  and without asking me if I was willing to talk to them  they started asking me questions about what had happened earlier in the day ’’ Chism said in a sworn statement accompanying the motion  “It seemed to me that they were going to finish getting the answers to their questions before they got me something to eat ’’Chism also explained what was shown on a surveillance video taken at the high school  the defense said  In other court papers  the Essex district attorney’s office has alleged that Chism is seen on the surveillance video donning a mask and entering the women’s bathroom where Ritzer was attacked and then seen moving the recycling bin from the school to the grounds The defense noted that Chism was taken into custody by Topsfield police after a missing persons report was broadcast for him by Danvers police  Yet for an hour  while he was at the Topsfield police station  he was handcuffed and police rummaged through his backpack without Chism’s approval  the defense said Despite the signed waiver  the defense argued  Chism’s rights were violated by the police in Topsfield and Danvers and evidence gained during those encounters should be suppressed   nProsecutors have said in court papers that Chism made incriminating statements when they interviewed him  They have also said that the items they recovered from Chism’s backpack included Ritzer’s credit card and cutting tools he allegedly used in the attack  Chism is also facing charges in Suffolk County for allegedly attacking a Department of Youth Services

sober since April 1995  “I’m going back to City Hall to make Boston the best city in the world ”Then Walsh again urged the prisoners to memorize and regularly recite step one of the 12 Steps of Recovery — proclaiming they’re powerless over addiction — and the Serenity Prayer  which begins “God  grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change ”The mayor’s words came as part of an hourlong tour of the prison and several of its programs that aim to ease the process of reentering society for inmates upon release According to the Suffolk County Sheriff’s Department  more than 3 000 inmates are released annually from the House of Correction and 95 percent of them return to a community within five miles of the Dorchester lockup The mayor and Sheriff Steven W  Tompkins said

House of Correction have little or no job training  come from unstable housing situations  are undereducated  and have committed drug  and alcohol related offenses The prison offers programs to address these issues  everything from GED  computer literacy  and resume writing classes to vocational education in carpentry  painting  and landscaping And once a month  the social service providers

women who are interested and knowledgeable about beer ” said Kristen Sykes  a home brewing veteran and founder of BABES  She said that the social group aims to enforce the idea that women not only like beer  but can be as knowledgeable about it as men  Sykes is the former executive director of the Massachusetts Brewer’s Guild  and is a certified beer judge “I have female friends who like beer  but it’s definitely a male dominated  totally stereotyped thing ” Miller said  “It’s always been ‘women with wine  men with beer ’ It’s neat to meet other women who really like beer ”  nAlthough BABES

tastings and food pairings  and crafting parties  Sykes said the variety of BABES meetings makes the group different than other beer groups Past BABES events have included a bike ride and beer tasting at Watch City Brewing in Waltham  a Firestone Walker beer tasting at the Meadhall in Cambridge  an overnight trip to Vermont  and a crafting party at the Stitch House in Dorchester Occasionally  they

that six cans of beer was about what the average woman could carry home from the supermarket   The idea for BABES came when Sykes moved to Boston from Philadelphia in early 2011  While living in

“Vinland 2” brew  She’s enrolling in the PhD program in yeast science at the Carlsberg Research Lab in Copenhagen   nMiller and Shell are occasional home brewers  Miller says she enjoys the experimentation and socialization that comes from home brewing with her friends  which she does three or four times a year  Shell’s husband  a home brewer for four or so years  inspired her to give it a try  and she’s been brewing for the last two  Some members  including Labrecque  have never home brewed  but enjoy learning about it  “We all share that we maybe don’t know everything  There’s no competition  and everyone is really supportive ” said Sykes  While the meetings vary  they are designed to be casual meet ups  At Doyle’s  the BABES sat in an alcove  ordered beers  and talked with members they recognized from previous meetings  Clark began her book presentation by introducing herself  then asking  “Well  what do you want to know ”In addition to their own meetings  BABES also collaborates with other groups  such as Mystery Meet — a social dining club — for some events  “We’re open to doing things with different organizations  A lot of people are interested in beer and weaving that into what their groups are doing ” Sykes said  The BABES are just one of many women’s beer groups emerging nationwide as the craft beer movement popularizes  At the end of March  the

Drive resident shoveling his SUV out of the snow today said he feared that the forthcoming tide would be significantly worse than last night’s  From the window inside his house  he’d already seen the buoys bobbing higher than they had before high tide last night  And because the moderate spillover last night had frozen solid on the ground  he said  new floodwaters will wash right over the area

Thursday discussing ways to strengthen the economic  social  and political relationships between their cities  separated by the Atlantic Ocean but connected through their people Mayor Martin J  Walsh and Mayor Ulisses Correia e Silva agreed that the two communities must work together on decreasing violence in Boston and Praia  increasing opportunity for small and midsize businesses  and tapping into the growing political muscle of a community that for years has been more associated with gun violence than political activism  n“The Diaspora is very important  it is an important factor for the development of Cape Verde ” Correia e Silva said before the meeting about a community in New England that is almost as large as the population of the West African Island nation  about 500 000 people Walsh is taking “a different approach here in Boston than my predecessor” by looking beyond the city’s borders to create economic growth  “It’s important for the city to have relationships with other countries  particularly those countries that have a large population here in Boston ” Walsh said Because of the strong inter generational connection between New England and Cape Verde  one that goes back hundreds of years  Correia e Silva would like to see greater investment from the region in Cape Verde’s health sector  tourism  renewable energy  and culture He would also like to build on and formalize existing relationships with places such as Berklee College of Music and the Boston Police Department  Praia’s mayor said two Boston police officers of Cape Verdean descent recently traveled to the small nation off the coast of Senegal to share their tactical and investigative experiences with the local police force Seated around the table with the mayors were some of Boston’s highest ranking Cape Verdean political figures  including John Barros  Walsh’s economic development chief  new state Representative Evandro Carvalho  and Alberto Montrond  head of the Cape Verdean Democratic Party in the Americas  n“This meeting alone means a lot ” said Carvalho  who emigrated from Cape Verde at 15 and now represents parts of Roxbury and Dorchester  “It’s what we need as a community ”“You should know that our representative was born in the city of Praia ” Barros told the small group “And I go back often ” Carvalho responded  “Anything I can do to help ”Walsh acknowledged the growing political clout of Boston’s Cape Verdean community  saying Carvalho’s election and Barros’s rise from nonprofit director to political figure was a sign of things to come “You can see in Boston the Cape Verdean community has a big political impact ” he said  “The Cape Verdean community is very  very strong  very  very united  And you’re going to see a lot more out of the Cape Verdean community  That relationship will be very helpful to us ”Still  Walsh said his priorities differ from Correia e Silva’s “I’m less so concerned right now about the economic development from Cape Verde to Boston as I am about solving some of the problems in some of the neighborhoods ” Walsh said  “We have to work on that ”The people of Praia  Walsh said  could “help us get messages to young people to respect one another  They’re shooting each other  Too many parents are coming here working hard  two and three jobs  and their kids are causing violence and killing each other ”Still  Walsh said tourism and helping local Cape Verdean businesses expand to the other side of the Atlantic are issues the relationship can help As the child of Irish immigrants  Walsh said  he knows the vital role that tourism plays in helping to keep families connected while boosting economies at home and abroad Correia e Silva ended his pitch to strengthen Boston’s ties to Praia by inviting Walsh to visit the archipelago

Journey driven by his uncle  Raymond E  Scott  48  a rapper and reality television show cast member known by the stage name Benzino  n“I shot at him  I was in fear for my wife and a baby ” Gai Scott said  according to a police report filed in court  “He’s been threatening my life ”Gai Scott’s lawyer entered a plea of not guilty on his behalf Monday to a charge of armed assault with intent to murder  Gai Scott is being held pending a dangerousness hearing set for Wednesday in Plymouth District Court  His lawyer  Jon Ciraulo  said he acted in self defense  nGai Scott told police that his uncle had been sending him text messages threatening to kill him in the week before the shooting and that he purchased a firearm to protect himself  State Trooper Robert M  Klimas wrote in a report filed in court  Scott also described himself as “security” for the funeral  the report said “Gai also stated that Raymond had been threatening to kill him for years ” Klimas wrote  “I asked Gai why Raymond wanted to harm him  and Gai stated that it stemmed from animosity and jealousy ”Gai Scott said he was driving a black 2006 Bentley behind a hearse in the procession in Duxbury when his uncle pulled up beside him in the left lane  rolled down his window  and said  “You got a problem with me” and then threatened to kill him  Klimas wrote “Gai stated that Raymond reached down low and when Raymond raised his hand he ‘flashed’ a gun at Gai ” the report said  He then pulled out a 9mm Walther pistol from a holster on his right hip and fired it at his uncle  the report said When that weapon ran out of ammunition  Gai Scott said  he started firing a  45 caliber gun until it was spent  He then loaded a spare magazine into the 9mm firearm  the report said  Scott is a legal gun owner  the report said Martin K  Leppo  a criminal and civil attorney who has represented Raymond Scott for years  dismissed the nephew’s claim of self defense “Six shots into Ray Scott’s car  and he chased him on the highway  that doesn’t sound like self defense to me ’’ Leppo said  He added that Raymond Scott did not have a firearm Raymond Scott sustained a gunshot wound to his right shoulder and an abrasion to his back  the report said  He was discharged from South Shore Hospital Monday In a telephone interview  he said that after he was shot  he ran to the hearse  which was carrying his mother’s body  for help “At that point  I thought I was going to die ” Raymond Scott said  The hearse  he said  kept going  and he eventually was picked up by another family member driving in the procession Leppo said Raymond Scott had decided against attending the funeral for his mother  Mary A  “Kinky”  Timas  Scott  but coincidentally came upon the funeral procession while en route to pick up a friend in Plymouth  where the service was taking place The friend was identified in a police report as Stevie J  who costars with Raymond Scott on the VH1 reality show ‘‘Love   Hip Hop  Atlanta ”Leppo added that tension between branches of the Scott family stemmed from Raymond Scott’s belief that his mother’s property and finances were being misused by his nephew’s family Leppo said that Raymond Scott had mourned his mother privately at a funeral home while no other family members were present Raymond Scott refused to say what he thinks motivated the shooting and started cursing when asked by a reporter about how he happened to encounter his mother’s funeral procession An affidavit filed in Dorchester District Court by a family member seeking a restraining order against him contradicts his statements about his visit to the funeral home  A relative wrote that Raymond Scott appeared Saturday with several men at Keohane Funeral Home and harassed Gai Scott’s mother  Maureen  and that he had threatened her in the past  Maureen and Raymond Scott are siblings  Leppo dismissed those assertions Scott grew up in Dorchester and was part of a rap group that infuriated Boston

neighborhoods are full of vacant lots that sit in the middle of bustling neighborhoods  and they all stick out like missing teeth  It just happens that this particular missing tooth  which is sandwiched between a neighborhood pub  the Savin Hill Red Line station  and the Southeast Expressway  also sits around the corner from Boston Mayor Marty Walsh’s house  Walsh just challenged the city  by the year 2030  and his neighborhood coffee spot sits directly across the street from a piece of land that should be pushing Boston toward that mark  Instead  a tug of war over 15 parking spaces is threatening to preserve a prime housing development parcel as an overgrown patch of nothing  And it’s showing that Boston’s broken zoning code weighs heaviest on the people who are least able to navigate it   t nThe land  which has been vacant for over a decade  is next to the Savin Bar and Kitchen  The current redevelopment proposal calls for filling in the gap along Savin Hill Avenue with a new retail storefront  and placing 14 condominiums above both the new storefront and the pub next door   nDevelopment fights in Boston almost always boil down to battles over height or parking  and this time it’s the parking  There won’t be enough room to park cars underneath the proposed building  A neighborhood civic group previously endorsed a version of the condominium project that included one parking spot for every condominium unit  with the new residents parking in a business lot down the block  That deal fell through  and a bid to build the new housing without any parking spots has split the neighborhood  A one spot per condo demand from the neighborhood could sink any construction on the site  Zero parking development isn’t a stretch in most of Boston  About one of every three households around the Savin Hill T station are car free already  It won’t be a tough sell to move 14 condos across the street from the Red Line  And  broadly  the trend line in Boston is heading toward fewer cars  not more  Even so  Boston’s zoning code is badly out of date  and it makes ordinary housing projects like the one in Savin Hill enormously difficult to pull off  More than anything else  this difficulty in getting small scale housing out of the ground is straining Boston’s housing supply  Boston’s broken zoning doesn’t just let builders put triple deckers in neighborhoods where they are commonplace  The city pushes small scale builders into a long  arduous building approval process — one that’s set up to give neighbors virtual veto power over new building  Big developers working in the downtown core often don’t need good zoning  because they’re used to getting their building permits by cutting deals with Boston development officials  Small builders don’t work on that level  It takes too long  and costs too much  to get approvals to build modest neighborhood buildings  It can be tougher to get a permit to build 14 condos in Dorchester than it is to get permits for a 38 story apartment tower at North Station  Zoning dysfunction keeps many builders on the sidelines  But Boston can’t keep stacking the deck against neighborhood redevelopment  because middle class housing opportunities lie scattered throughout the city’s neighborhoods  not downtown  Boston can’t keep ignoring empty lots  small projects in the outlying neighborhoods  and triple deckers elbowing in between existing triple deckers  If Boston is going to hit its new housing goal  a big part of the lift has to be in gap parcels like the one in Walsh’s neighborhood  Boston has scores of vacant parcels sitting between triple decker houses  They should become modestly scaled housing projects  but they often don’t  because complicated city regulations get in the way  Walsh’s administration is now tackling a city zoning overhaul  to help advance its new housing goal  That effort should start by making it easier to build typical Boston buildings in the city’s neighborhoods  Fifty three thousand new homes is an ambitious housing goal  but it’s a lot more achievable if it starts with a focus on the small stuff', '2014_220')",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Gretchen Ertl for the Boston Globe n n n n n nPeggy woke early in the quiet apartment  She gave herself plenty of time to get ready and get to the hospital  Her son Mike was getting out this April morning  last year  and she didn’t want to be late  didn’t want to take the chance that he would start to worry  It had been two months since his mad  euphoric march down the center of Dorchester Avenue  He’d been off his medications and was on a manic spiral that ended in a psychiatric hospital in Quincy  He’d spent the last seven weeks there  Now  he seemed better than he had in years  calmer and more reasonable  But Peggy didn’t want to risk upsetting him  She knew that sometimes she could set Mike off  This time  she was determined that things would go smoothly She paused for a quick look around  Everything was clean and ready  the freezer stocked with his favorite chicken wings  She scooped up Mike’s cigarettes — he would want them right away — and hurried out the door to her car in the driveway Mike was 33 years old  He’d been in and out of institutions for half his life  since he first got sick when he was 17  His diagnosis had changed over the years — it was schizophrenia  then bipolar disorder  then schizoaffective disorder — and his medications were in constant flux  Things stayed good for a while  then went bad again  Now Mike’s medications seemed to be working  and he was saying that he wanted to stay on them — a view he didn’t always take  But there had been so many days like this  so many hopeful new beginningsOften  when bringing him home from a hospital stay  Peggy saw again the man she knew  funny and charming  intelligent and sweet  And then she watched that man disappear  receding from her as though into the depths of a lake  He was replaced by someone else  whose thoughts she did not understand  Mike suffered at times from delusions  His mother never feared him  but some of the neighbors did  interpreting his loudness and profanity as threatening Peggy had lived for years with the constant worry  She had lived with the complaints from neighbors and the calls from the police in the middle of the night  she had coped with Mike giving all his money to strangers or throwing all their food away  believing it was poisoned  She had watched his friends grow up and get jobs and get married  while he remained trapped in place  Yet she still believed that one day  the right treatment would free them  Mike would stay well  and she would have her son back She pulled into the hospital parking lot and stepped out of the car  It was early April  the branches bare  Peggy hustled into the lobby  A nurse got up from the desk and went to get Mike  He was in a magnanimous mood  saying his farewells  giving away his socks and other stray belongings on his way out the door He smoked one cigarette after another on the way home  He talked about the uncomfortable conditions in the hospital — the hard mattress  the locked bathroom  When Peggy turned to check traffic behind her before changing lanes  Mike told her not to take her eyes off the road “Use your mirrors ” he instructed They arrived home at the house they rented on a quiet wooded street  He settled in on the big blue couch in the living room  Peggy fussed over him briefly  then went to work  at her bookkeeping job at a small manufacturing company  Later on she would fill his prescriptions  She lined up the bottles in the kitchen  in an old wooden spice rack she had painted white  Every morning before she went to work  she took down the bottles and counted out the pills — one for depression and another one for anxiety  a third to fend off psychosis and a fourth that was supposed to stabilize his moods  There were others too  to combat side effects  She piled them all in a Dixie cup and carried it to him in the living room  placing it beside him on the table There was nothing unique about their morning ritual  Across the state  across the country  one in four families copes with a mental illness  Thousands of young men and women live with these conditions  thousands of caring  committed parents and relatives help to watch over them  These individuals don’t need to stay in a hospital — with the right medicine  and other support  they can manage  even thrive  Some find it easy to take the medications  but many others struggle  as Mike  has  Because the pills have unpleasant side effects  Because the medication just makes them feel bad  Or  sometimes  because they’re not convinced they’re sick  These are the patients nobody knows what to do with  who flood emergency rooms and jails and courts In Massachusetts  as in other states  mental health care has largely moved out of hospitals and into communities  In many ways  this is better for patients  Still  stability can be elusive  setbacks common  the illness is brutally persistent  And so much falls to family members  In a crisis  they may find themselves adrift — struggling to navigate a disjointed  often dysfunctional system  unable to get the help patients need — either because the help isn’t there  or because they can’t find their way to it When Mike stopped taking his pills  trouble typically followed  He would disappear and his mother would fear the worst  There would be visits from police  trips to the ER  and court appearances  The job of managing the chaos fell to Peggy  but she had no formal  legal role  because her son was an adult  She was on the outside looking in when doctors  judges  and social workers made decisions  Yet she was the one who was with Mike every day Peggy was deeply religious  She knew if she prayed  God would help She prayed that this time would be different  It had to be  n nne week later  in a noisy  crowded courtroom  Mike stood up before a judge  ready to make a fresh start  His dark hair was neatly combed back  he wore a black suit coat that bunched up behind his shoulders  The court date had been set for months  It had loomed over them  casting a shadow on Mike and his 58 year old mother  Peggy  small and pale with blue eyes and honey colored hair  sat nervously watching in the gallery behind him  Mike’s girlfriend  Renee Johnson  sat beside her  Renee and Mike had met years earlier  she had a mental illness  too  and was endlessly supportive Mike felt the weight of the winter back upon him  when he had stopped taking his meds and ended up in the hospital  He’d been arrested late on New Year’s Eve  after blasting his radio and dancing in the street  He’d been feeling good  confident and fearless  the way he always did without his medications  The cops had showed up and assumed he was drunk  They didn’t listen when he told them he was sober  he got frustrated and called them Nazis  That had been wrong  he understood now  He just wanted to put that night behind him The judge studied some papers and looked up  regarding Mike benignly from between the glow of two old fashioned glass lamps “Are you taking your medication ” the judge asked him “Yes  sir ” Mike said “And are you thinking clearly ”“I believe so ” answered Mike  He hadn’t meant to be funny — only honest — but something in his earnest tone struck a comic note  Laughter rippled through the crowd behind him “Well  only one person in this courtroom would know that ” the judge said An assistant DA read from a police report  recounting the facts that had led to his arrest  The charge was for “obnoxious behavior” undertaken “to cause public inconvenience ” Mike pleaded guilty  and the judge issued the sentence  one $100 fine for disturbing the peace  another $100 for disorderly conduct A few minutes later  in the hall outside the courtroom  his mother and his girlfriend were beside him  beaming  Since Mike had come home  Peggy had found herself walking on eggshells  wondering if his recovery was as real it seemed  This day had been a test  In the past  Mike might have argued with the judge  or turned to flash the peace sign to the courtroom  Seeing him stand there now  calmly trying to wipe his slate clean  Peggy felt ecstatic with relief  She was almost giddy as the three of them stepped outside the courthouse into the raw and chilly April afternoon It was Friday  Peggy had taken the day off from work  Monday was Patriots Day  a holiday  With a few precious days off and the weight of Mike’s sentencing gone  Peggy felt freer than she had in weeks  She drove them home  and they settled into the living room Mike and Renee talked easily together  comparing coping strategies for getting through bad days “You imagine your bad thoughts are fluffy clouds ” Mike said  “and the clouds break up and float away ”“Or you picture your mind like a Teflon frying pan  and the bad thoughts slide right out ” Renee chimed in Peggy watched them from across the room  savoring the moment of lighthearted normalcy  There had been little of that in recent memory  as her husband battled bone cancer and died two years ago  Richie’s death at 58 had been excruciating  Yet in the midst of it  Mike had been at his best  caring for his father with attentive tenderness  They had all been struck by it  how Mike had stepped up and found an even keel at the very moment when they needed him the most His father had taught Mike to play guitar as a kid  Richie loved the Beatles  and so Mike did too  Later Mike worked as a cab driver  again like his dad Mike wondered if his father looked down on him from heaven  and why he didn’t intervene to ease his earthly struggles “Maybe I wasn’t a good son ” Mike said “Yes  you were  Mike ” his mother and girlfriend assured him in unison “You brought a lot of happiness to people ” Peggy told him “And a lot of misery ” Mike added A pained look flashed across his mother’s face “We all wish you didn’t have this illness ” she said in a soft voice “You imagine your bad thoughts are fluffy clouds  and the clouds break up and float away ” — Mike BourneA part of Mike resisted the idea that he was ill  The real problem  it seemed to him  was that the world had become restrictive and intolerant of people who were different  He meant no harm to anyone — if others felt threatened by the things he said or did  that was their problem to solve  not his  He’d told his mother he would keep taking his medications  and he meant to keep his word  but that didn’t change the fact that he was bitter He hated the drugs  with their vile side effects  insomnia  weight gain  constipation  impotence  The new meds were causing painful blisters on his skin  More than that  he felt dull  Other people didn’t understand — when he took the meds  he felt small and hollowed out  He craved the easy joy he felt when he ditched the pills — the release he’d felt when he’d left the Dorchester hospital and followed the yellow line home  That had been the start of another disastrous unmedicated odyssey  proof  his mother and Renee insisted  that taking his medication was worth it  because the pills would keep him out of the hospital  and jail  Some days he agreed  but other times he wondered  Wasn’t feeling good the most important thing  Why should that be denied to him  nn a nondescript beige building behind the Norwood train station  Mike Bourne sat in his therapist’s office  He usually met with Jill Nagorniak every week or two  but he didn’t see her when he was in the hospital  Now that he was back out in the world again — three weeks had passed since his discharge in April — he had returned to this small  familiar room Mike wore sneakers and a Red Sox cap  he held an enormous Dunkin’ Donuts coffee in his lap  He had brought an oversized coffee for Jill  too  Drinking coffee helped Mike feel sharper  more alive  when he was on his medication — it was one of his few pleasures — but his mother worried that it also made him manic “People have questioned your coffee use ” Jill reminded him sternly Mike dodged the question  his tone playful  “I’m not a bad guy ” he said “No ” Jill allowed  giving in to his ploy  “I think the world of you ”The patient and the therapist knew each other well  Mike had been seeing her for more than a decade  Mike liked Jill  and he believed she liked him  She often seemed to understand what he was feeling  and she had sympathy for his situation  both the relentless undertow of his condition and the way the health care system  in the past  had sometimes failed him  Mike liked how it felt when someone defended him  Jill was a guide who would try to keep him on track  reminding him what he needed to do to stay well Both of them knew what usually happened  Mike would start to feel bad  because of his meds  and so after weeks or months he would stop taking them  At some point in the past  he had been prescribed Percocet for pain  and found to his delight that it lifted his mood  too “I’m not a bad guy ” — MikeRelatives had warned him the painkillers were addictive  and that they might interfere with his prescribed medication  Mike didn’t know if that was true or just a theory  All he knew was that the pills gave him some relief  made his life briefly feel enjoyable again He wasn’t taking any painkillers now  But tomorrow he was going to the doctor  he told Jill  Months ago  doctors had cut out a piece of his tongue to test it for cancer  The biopsy results were inconclusive  and the pain was still excruciating The therapist looked at him  her expression worried “If you can get painkillers tomorrow  will you refuse ” she asked Mike felt frustration flare  No  he told his therapist  If pain pills were offered  he would take them They sat in silence  staring at each other  The murmur of voices from other therapy sessions seeped through the walls “This will be a big test

do you mean ” she asked They’d been waiting for him when he got off work  he said “Did you see them ” she asked him  confused “No ” Mike told her  “But I knew they were there ”The terror of that night was still etched in her memory  waiting in the ER  thinking he must be on drugs  trying to grasp what it meant when it turned out he wasn’t  Mike spent weeks in a psychiatric hospital before he was released  in time to graduate with his high school class that spring Everyone hoped it was a blip  an aberration — that he could resume his normal adolescent path  headed for adulthood and living on his own Instead  it was only the beginning His family remembered the beautiful child he had been  That lovable  clever boy was within him still — the one who put on shows  who they called “Mr  Hollywood ” But the darkness had descended  and they had grown weary of the endless churn of chaos And now it was happening again Watching Mike closely as April turned to May  Peggy felt her normal worry bloom into unease  Mike still seemed OK  some of the time  But he had started making strange phone calls again Not sure what to do or where to turn  Peggy called her 56 year old sister in law  Rhonda  She was the curly haired youngest sister of Peggy’s late husband Richie  Unlike Peggy  who tended to withdraw from confrontation  Rhonda was forceful  and tenacious as a bulldog when she sensed injustice  A social worker at Fuller Mental Health Center in Boston  she worked with psychiatric patients every day  She was feisty and resourceful and determined  opinionated and active in state politics  and she understood the mental health care system far better than most people  She was married with a daughter of her own  but Michael’s struggles always hit her hard “How can he be getting sick again already ” Rhonda said when Peggy got her on the phone Peggy told her what was going on — that Mike was consumed by conspiracy theories  He believed former president George W  Bush had been involved in the Sept  11  2001  attacks  and he wanted the truth to come out  Only then could America be great again  he said  But he feared the Bush family would seek revenge  Mike had called the local police and warned them to wear their bulletproof vests  in case assassins came after him  He had called the FBI and White House to offer his help Rhonda had received phone calls from him  too  She and Peggy recognized what was happening — the start of another downward spiral  If they didn’t stop it now  it would soon get worse Rhonda ticked off possible causes of his deterioration

short of a goal to put a record 12 000 young people to work this year Walsh  who took office in January  admittedly got a late start recruiting local businesses  but his efforts and ambitions for the city’s summer jobs program underscore the legacy left by the late Mayor Thomas M  Menino  who died Thursday  youth advocates said  Rarely do political leaders adopt signature policies of their predecessors  t n“It’s remarkable this mayor has embraced a legacy from the previous mayor ” said Neil Sullivan  executive director of the Boston Private Industry Council  which recruits Boston high school students for jobs with private employers Menino was renowned for coaxing and cajoling executives at every opportunity to open their doors to the city’s teens  rarely speaking to business groups without making a pitch for the summer jobs program and a plea to hire the city’s youth  Walsh launched his efforts last spring  convincing about 40 additional businesses and unions to participate  The program provided a total of 10 187 public and private summer jobs  according to the city “We did learn a lot this year ” Walsh said in an interview  “Now we have an opportunity to take this program and really grow it ”The city’s summer jobs program is a national model that relies on city  state  and private funding of nearly $10 million a year to employ about 10 000 city teens each summer  It began on a small scale  though In the mid 1990s  a meeting between Menino and an executive at the Boston insurer John Hancock Financial Services resulted in a partnership between the company and the Boston Police Department  John Hancock funded a program called “Summer of Opportunity” that provided jobs for 40 city teens considered at risk of turning to crime Menino reached out to youths  whether at block parties or community events  giving them his business card when they asked for jobs and putting them in touch with people who would help  That’s how Shari Davis  a 26 year old Boston University graduate and one of the youngest department heads in the Walsh administration  got her first job She worked as a karate instructor for $7 an hour at Boston community centers  Menino later chose her as an adviser to his youth council “He demanded that you champion whatever it was that was important to you ” said Davis  executive director of the Department of Youth Engagement and Employment  “He gave you the opportunity to take ownership ”Menino did what few other mayors did  budgeting millions for summer jobs  He lobbied for state and federal funding  leaned on the private sector to take part  and fought to keep the jobs program going through good and bad times In 2000  when the state’s unemployment rate fell below 3 percent during the dot com boom  Menino sharply criticized the Republican governor  the late A  Paul Cellucci  for cutting nearly $4 million from youth employment programs  on the premise that private sector employers were hiring  He then lobbied President Bill Clinton and Senator Edward M  Kennedy for emergency funding  albeit unsuccessfully In 2003  when Massachusetts was mired in a deep recession following the dot com bust  Menino had to slash city spending on youth programs as part of deep cuts that included layoffs of teachers and city employees  He pressured business leaders to ramp up participation in the jobs program Menino believed wholeheartedly that putting teens to work prevented crime  When researchers found no definitive link between summer jobs programs and lower crime  Menino  in a 2003 interview  dismissed the conclusions “What do criminologists know ” he said  “They read books  I study it every day by talking to people ”Many people benefited from Menino’s unwavering support of youth  Nakieshia Fullington  a senior at the University of Massachusetts Boston  said her summer job as peer leader for a Dorchester youth group guided her decision to go into teaching  helping her realize that she wanted to spend her life working with teens “I realized my gift was teaching ” said Fullington  21  who plans to become a high school history teacher  “If I didn’t go  I’d probably still be wondering what to do with my life  A lot of my friends are ”The challenge for Walsh will be building on this legacy  said Lew Finfer  an organizer at the Youth Jobs Coalition  a nonprofit that advocates for youth employment programs In Boston  hundreds of companies participate  but increasing that number is always difficult  said Finfer  whose group recruits private employers for summer jobs programs  What makes it a bit easier  Finfer said  is when business leaders know the issue is close to the mayor’s heart Walsh  who advocated for youth jobs spending as a state legislator  said he’ll continue to push more companies to provide summer employment  though he was not ready to announce a goal for 2015  He and his staff cold called city businesses and held roundtable discussions with high tech and life sciences executives  urging them to participate Walsh said he’s considering a mentorship program and other ways to connect businesses with young people all year long  He noted that thousands of students from around the world pour into Boston’s universities each year  in pursuit of careers and better lives “I want to make sure the kids of Boston get the same opportunity ” he said  n',

Trouble  hospital  home  into the depths again  Now  sustained by his mother’s unimaginably patient love  he aims to make his way back  t nBy    Globe staffPhotos by Suzanne Kreiter   Globe staff and Gretchen Ertl for the Boston Globe n n n n n nPeggy woke early in the quiet apartment  She gave herself plenty of time to get ready and get to the hospital  Her son Mike was getting out this April morning  last year  and she didn’t want to be late  didn’t want to take the chance that he would start to worry  It had been two months since his mad  euphoric march down the center of Dorchester Avenue  He’d been off his medications and was on a manic spiral that ended in a psychiatric hospital in Quincy  He’d spent the last seven weeks there  Now  he seemed better than he had in years  calmer and more reasonable  But Peggy didn’t want to risk upsetting him  She knew that sometimes she could set Mike off  This time  she was determined that things would go smoothly She paused for a quick look around  Everything was clean and ready  the freezer stocked with his favorite chicken wings  She scooped up Mike’s cigarettes — he would want them right away — and hurried out the door to her car in the driveway Mike was 33 years old  He’d been in and out of institutions for half his life  since he first got sick when he was 17  His diagnosis had changed over the years — it was schizophrenia  then bipolar disorder  then schizoaffective disorder — and his medications were in constant flux  Things stayed good for a while  then went bad again  Now Mike’s medications seemed to be working  and he was saying that he wanted to stay on them — a view he didn’t always take  But there had been so many days like this  so many hopeful new beginnings Often  when bringing him home from a hospital stay  Peggy saw again the man she knew  funny and charming  intelligent and sweet  And then she watched that man disappear  receding from her as though into the depths of a lake  He was replaced by someone else  whose thoughts she did not understand  Mike suffered at times from delusions  His mother never feared him  but some of the neighbors did  interpreting his loudness and profanity as threatening Peggy had lived for years with the constant worry  She had lived with the complaints from neighbors and the calls from the police in the middle of the night  she had coped with Mike giving all his money to strangers or throwing all their food away  believing it was poisoned  She had watched his friends grow up and get jobs and get married  while he remained trapped in place  Yet she still believed that one day  the right treatment would free them  Mike would stay well  and she would have her son back She pulled into the hospital parking lot and stepped out of the car  It was early April  the branches bare  Peggy hustled into the lobby  A nurse got up from the desk and went to get Mike  He was in a magnanimous mood  saying his farewells  giving away his socks and other stray belongings on his way out the door He smoked one cigarette after another on the way home  He talked about the uncomfortable conditions in the hospital — the hard mattress  the locked bathroom  When Peggy turned to check traffic behind her before changing lanes  Mike told her not to take her eyes off the road “Use your mirrors ” he instructed They arrived home at the house they rented on a quiet wooded street  He settled in on the big blue couch in the living room  Peggy fussed over him briefly  then went to work  at her bookkeeping job at a small manufacturing company  Later on she would fill his prescriptions  She lined up the bottles in the kitchen  in an old wooden spice rack she had painted white  Every morning before she went to work  she took down the bottles and counted out the pills — one for depression and another one for anxiety  a third to fend off psychosis and a fourth that was supposed to stabilize his moods  There were others too  to combat side effects  She piled them all in a Dixie cup and carried it to him in the living room  placing it beside him on the table There was nothing unique about their morning ritual  Across the state  across the country  one in four families copes with a mental illness  Thousands of young men and women live with these conditions  thousands of caring  committed parents and relatives help to watch over them  These individuals don’t need to stay in a hospital — with the right medicine  and other support  they can manage  even thrive  Some find it easy to take the medications  but many others struggle  as Mike  has  Because the pills have unpleasant side effects  Because the medication just makes them feel bad  Or  sometimes  because they’re not convinced they’re sick  These are the patients nobody knows what to do with  who flood emergency rooms and jails and courts In Massachusetts  as in other states  mental health care has largely moved out of hospitals and into communities  In many ways  this is better for patients  Still  stability can be elusive  setbacks common  the illness is brutally persistent  And so much falls to family members  In a crisis  they may find themselves adrift — struggling to navigate a disjointed  often dysfunctional system  unable to get the help patients need — either because the help isn’t there  or because they can’t find their way to it When Mike stopped taking his pills  trouble typically followed  He would disappear and his mother would fear the worst  There would be visits from police  trips to the ER  and court appearances  The job of managing the chaos fell to Peggy  but she had no formal  legal role  because her son was an adult  She was on the outside looking in when doctors  judges  and social workers made decisions  Yet she was the one who was with Mike every day Peggy was deeply religious  She knew if she prayed  God would help She prayed that this time would be different  It had to be  n nne week later  in a noisy  crowded courtroom  Mike stood up before a judge  ready to make a fresh start  His dark hair was neatly combed back  he wore a black suit coat that bunched up behind his shoulders  The court date had been set for months  It had loomed over them  casting a shadow on Mike and his 58 year old mother  Peggy  small and pale with blue eyes and honey colored hair  sat nervously watching in the gallery behind him  Mike’s girlfriend  Renee Johnson  sat beside her  Renee and Mike had met years earlier  she had a mental illness  too  and was endlessly supportive Mike felt the weight of the winter back upon him  when he had stopped taking his meds and ended up in the hospital  He’d been arrested late on New Year’s Eve  after blasting his radio and dancing in the street  He’d been feeling good  confident and fearless  the way he always did without his medications  The cops had showed up and assumed he was drunk  They didn’t listen when he told them he was sober  he got frustrated and called them Nazis  That had been wrong  he understood now  He just wanted to put that night behind him The judge studied some papers and looked up  regarding Mike benignly from between the glow of two old fashioned glass lamps “Are you taking your medication ” the judge asked him “Yes  sir ” Mike said “And are you thinking clearly ”“I believe so ” answered Mike  He hadn’t meant to be funny — only honest — but something in his earnest tone struck a comic note  Laughter rippled through the crowd behind him “Well  only one person in this courtroom would know that ” the judge said An assistant DA read from a police report  recounting the facts that had led to his arrest  The charge was for “obnoxious behavior” undertaken “to cause public inconvenience ” Mike pleaded guilty  and the judge issued the sentence  one $100 fine for disturbing the peace  another $100 for disorderly conduct A few minutes later  in the hall outside the courtroom  his mother and his girlfriend were beside him  beaming  Since Mike had come home  Peggy had found herself walking on eggshells  wondering if his recovery was as real it seemed  This day had been a test  In the past  Mike might have argued with the judge  or turned to flash the peace sign to the courtroom  Seeing him stand there now  calmly trying to wipe his slate clean  Peggy felt ecstatic with relief  She was almost giddy as the three of them stepped outside the courthouse into the raw and chilly April afternoon It was Friday  Peggy had taken the day off from work  Monday was Patriots Day  a holiday  With a few precious days off and the weight of Mike’s sentencing gone  Peggy felt freer than she had in weeks  She drove them home  and they settled into the living room Mike and Renee talked easily together  comparing coping strategies for getting through bad days “You imagine your bad thoughts are fluffy clouds ” Mike said  “and the clouds break up and float away ”“Or you picture your mind like a Teflon frying pan  and the bad thoughts slide right out ” Renee chimed in Peggy watched them from across the room  savoring the moment of lighthearted normalcy  There had been little of that in recent memory  as her husband battled bone cancer and died two years ago  Richie’s death at 58 had been excruciating  Yet in the midst of it  Mike had been at his best  caring for his father with attentive tenderness  They had all been struck by it  how Mike had stepped up and found an even keel at the very moment when they needed him the most His father had taught Mike to play guitar as a kid  Richie loved the Beatles  and so Mike did too  Later Mike worked as a cab driver  again like his dad Mike wondered if his father looked down on him from heaven  and why he didn’t intervene to ease his earthly struggles “Maybe I wasn’t a good son ” Mike said “Yes  you were  Mike ” his mother and girlfriend assured him in unison “You brought a lot of happiness to people ” Peggy told him “And a lot of misery ” Mike added A pained look flashed across his mother’s face “We all wish you didn’t have this illness ” she said in a soft voice “You imagine your bad thoughts are fluffy clouds  and the clouds break up and float away ” — Mike BourneA part of Mike resisted the idea that he was ill  The real problem  it seemed to him  was that the world had become restrictive and intolerant of people who were different  He meant no harm to anyone — if others felt threatened by the things he said or did  that was their problem to solve  not his  He’d told his mother he would keep taking his medications  and he meant to keep his word  but that didn’t change the fact that he was bitter He hated the drugs  with their vile side effects  insomnia  weight gain  constipation  impotence  The new meds were causing painful blisters on his skin  More than that  he felt dull  Other people didn’t understand — when he took the meds  he felt small and hollowed out  He craved the easy joy he felt when he ditched the pills — the release he’d felt when he’d left the Dorchester hospital and followed the yellow line home  That had been the start of another disastrous unmedicated odyssey  proof  his mother and Renee insisted  that taking his medication was worth it  because the pills would keep him out of the hospital  and jail  Some days he agreed  but other times he wondered  Wasn’t feeling good the most important thing  Why should that be denied to him  nn a nondescript beige building behind the Norwood train station  Mike Bourne sat in his therapist’s office  He usually met with Jill Nagorniak every week or two  but he didn’t see her when he was in the hospital  Now that he was back out in the world again — three weeks had passed since his discharge in April — he had returned to this small  familiar room Mike wore sneakers and a Red Sox cap  he held an enormous Dunkin’ Donuts coffee in his lap  He had brought an oversized coffee for Jill  too  Drinking coffee helped Mike feel sharper  more alive  when he was on his medication — it was one of his few pleasures — but his mother worried that it also made him manic “People have questioned your coffee use ” Jill reminded him sternly Mike dodged the question  his tone playful  “I’m not a bad guy ” he said “No ” Jill allowed  giving in to his ploy  “I think the world of you ”The patient and the therapist knew each other well  Mike had been seeing her for more than a decade  Mike liked Jill  and he believed she liked him  She often seemed to understand what he was feeling  and she had sympathy for his situation  both the relentless undertow of his condition and the way the health care system  in the past  had sometimes failed him  Mike liked how it felt when someone defended him  Jill was a guide who would try to keep him on track  reminding him what he needed to do to stay well Both of them knew what usually happened  Mike would start to feel bad  because of his meds  and so after weeks or months he would stop taking them  At some point in the past  he had been prescribed Percocet for pain  and found to his delight that it lifted his mood  too “I’m not a bad guy ” — MikeRelatives had warned him the painkillers were addictive  and that they might interfere with his prescribed medication  Mike didn’t know if that was true or just a theory  All he knew was that the pills gave him some relief  made his life briefly feel enjoyable again He wasn’t taking any painkillers now  But tomorrow he was going to the doctor  he told Jill  Months ago  doctors had cut out a piece of his tongue to test it for cancer  The biopsy results were inconclusive  and the pain was still excruciating The therapist looked at him  her expression worried “If you can get painkillers tomorrow  will you refuse ” she asked Mike felt frustration flare  No  he told his therapist  If pain pills were offered  he would take them They sat in silence  staring at each other  The murmur of voices from other therapy sessions seeped through the walls “This will be a big test for you ” Jill said  n ne was 17 the first time he got sick  A high school senior who threw parties in the basement  a street smart kid who could talk to anybody  who spent hours working at a local

do you mean ” she asked They’d been waiting for him when he got off work  he said “Did you see them ” she asked him  confused “No ” Mike told her  “But I knew they were there ”The terror of that night was still etched in her memory  waiting in the ER  thinking he must be on drugs  trying to grasp what it meant when it turned out he wasn’t  Mike spent weeks in a psychiatric hospital before he was released  in time to graduate with his high school class that spring Everyone hoped it was a blip  an aberration — that he could resume his normal adolescent path  headed for adulthood and living on his own Instead  it was only the beginning His family remembered the beautiful child he had been  That lovable  clever boy was within him still — the one who put on shows  who they called “Mr  Hollywood ” But the darkness had descended  and they had grown weary of the endless churn of chaos And now it was happening again Watching Mike closely as April turned to May  Peggy felt her normal worry bloom into unease  Mike still seemed OK  some of the time  But he had started making strange phone calls again Not sure what to do or where to turn  Peggy called her 56 year old sister in law  Rhonda  She was the curly haired youngest sister of Peggy’s late husband Richie  Unlike Peggy  who tended to withdraw from confrontation  Rhonda was forceful  and tenacious as a bulldog when she sensed injustice  A social worker at Fuller Mental Health Center in Boston  she worked with psychiatric patients every day  She was feisty and resourceful and determined  opinionated and active in state politics  and she understood the mental health care system far better than most people  She was married with a daughter of her own  but Michael’s struggles always hit her hard “How can he be getting sick again already ” Rhonda said when Peggy got her on the phone Peggy told her what was going on — that Mike was consumed by conspiracy theories  He believed former president George W  Bush had been involved in the Sept  11  2001  attacks  and he wanted the truth to come out  Only then could America be great again  he said  But he feared the Bush family would seek revenge  Mike had called the local police and warned them to wear their bulletproof vests  in case assassins came after him  He had called the FBI and White House to offer his help Rhonda had received phone calls from him  too  She and Peggy recognized what was happening — the start of another downward spiral  If they didn’t stop it now  it would soon get worse Rhonda ticked off possible causes of his deterioration  Maybe the medications weren’t working  Maybe the doses weren’t high enough  Or maybe he wasn’t taking them at all  Even though Peggy tried to keep an eye on him as he tossed back the cup of pills

voicing his toughest opposition so far at a forum in Dorchester and firing off a letter to state officials urging swift action if inaccuracies are found in the companies’ applications “I am writing to express my serious concern regarding the two registered marijuana dispensary applicants in the city of Boston ’’ the mayor wrote in a letter dated Tuesday that was addressed to the state’s secretary of health and human services  John Polanowicz  and the executive director of the state’s medical marijuana program  Karen Van Unen  nWalsh said questions have been raised about the two companies  Green Heart Holistic Health   Pharmaceuticals Inc   which is eyeing a 3 000 square foot dispensary at 70 Southampton St   and Good Chemistry of Massachusetts Inc   which has planned a store on Boylston Street He noted that the state is assessing the veracity of dispensary applications and urged “swift and uniform action” if inaccuracies are found  saying that would reaffirm confidence in the regulatory process “If any information provided in either application is confirmed to be inaccurate  I ask that the Department of Public Health immediately eliminate that application from being eligible for a final certification of registration ’’ Walsh wrote A state health and human services spokeswoman did not return repeated calls for comment Tuesday The letter follows public comments Walsh made during a community presentation Monday  The mayor said he is “dead set” against marijuana dispensaries  has long opposed medical marijuana laws  and would prevent stores in Boston that sell cannabis  n“I have made it very clear to the state that I don’t want these dispensaries in our city ’’ Walsh told about 200 people at Pleasant Hill Baptist Church  a small wooden house of worship on a corner of Humboldt Avenue  in a neighborhood where opposition to the marijuana dispensaries is fierce But Walsh probably faces an uphill battle to stop the shops  analysts said  With a voter approved law establishing the dispensaries and a state licensing process underway  Walsh might be able to stall the process by using the city’s zoning laws  but ultimately would have little power to permanently ban the stores  said Jeffrey M  Berry  a Tufts University political science professor “I don’t see a clear power to prevent these stores ’’ Berry said  “But certainly the thing the mayor can do is to delay this and make their lives miserable ”Walsh made his comments months after the city’s Board of Health finalized regulations in November ensuring local oversight of the dispensaries The Boston Public Health Commission has remained neutral about the planned dispensaries  which have come under fire in some communities “I think Mayor Walsh has voiced some concerns about the application process ’’ said Nick Martin  spokesman for the Health Commission  “Our role has been and will be to provide local oversight if and when the dispensaries open in Boston ”The city regulations give the Health Commission authority to grant operating permits for dispensaries  conduct three inspections annually  and have control over patient educational materials on substance abuse prevention  Dispensary owners are required to have annual community meetings Voters approved a November 2012 ballot initiative legalizing marijuana for medical treatment  and the measure allowed for an open marketplace to support cannabis for health purposes Under the law  the state can pick up to 35 nonprofit companies to open dispensaries in Massachusetts  In January  the state’s Department of

public backlash over opening a dispensary in the Back Bay  The Globe also reported that the company provided misleading information to state regulators in its license application  erroneously claiming to have support from state lawmakers and the district’s city councilor The two companies have not applied for required permits from the city’s Health Commission  said Martin  the commission spokesman Matthew Allen  executive director of the prodispensary Massachusetts Patient Advocacy Alliance  urged quick implementation of the dispensary licenses  saying that any delay causes needless suffering for patients “A more sensible and compassionate approach than eliminating the Boston applicants at this point ” he said  “would be for the city to work with dispensary operators and community members

of his presentation at Pleasant Hill Baptist The Rev  Miniard Culpepper  the church’s pastor  read aloud questions from those in attendance that had been written on white strips of paper One person asked the mayor how the city can reduce drug dealing and violence while also legalizing marijuana “Well  I’m dead set against legalizing marijuana ’’ Walsh responded  “I was dead set against the marijuana dispensaries  and I was dead set against all the marijuana laws because they are dangerous ”The mayor said he believes that marijuana is a gateway to other drugs  saying he watched many of his friends who had “started smoking weed’’ go on to harder drugs “I fought them my entire career up on Beacon Hill  and I will fight them as mayor of the city of Boston ’’ Walsh said Culpepper

dangerous ”Officials said they had flooding concerns in coastal communities including Duxbury and Scituate  where residents in certain areas have been asked to voluntarily evacuate in anticipation of

 given the cold  there will be impacts  for sure ” Davey said  Most schools  colleges  and universities were closed today and most are expected to be in the same status on Friday in the wake of forecasts that snow will fall throughout Thursday night and into Friday morning  bringing with it dangerously cold air measured in single digits Patrick said it will be up to local communities to decide whether to shut schools  The governor also said he has activated the Massachusetts National Guard to support state and local storm response efforts  but has not officially declared a state of

region has endured  “Temperatures will be extreme ’’ Patrick said  adding that some areas could see wind chills drop as low as 25 below zero  He urged residents to check on neighbors  to limit exposure to the bitter cold  and to make sure emergency kits are updated  Officials are also anxiously watching storm surges with particular concern focused on easterly facing coastal communities

Bristol County murder trial of Aaron Hernandez could last between six weeks and 2½ months  prosecutors said Monday The former New England Patriots star was in court for a pretrial hearing in the June 2013 shooting death of Odin L  Lloyd of Boston  Jury selection is scheduled to begin Jan  9  Hernandez  25  has pleaded not guilty  t nHis fiancee  Shayanna Jenkins  appeared in court earlier Monday for a hearing in her own case — she has pleaded not guilty to lying to the grand jury that indicted Hernandez Hernandez grinned at his lawyers as he entered the courtroom and smiled frequently at Jenkins  who sat in the back of the courtroom during Hernandez’s hearing  away from Lloyd’s family Hernandez has pleaded not guilty in the death of Lloyd  who was dating Jenkins’s sister at the time of his death  Lloyd  a 27 year old semipro football player from Dorchester  was found fatally shot in an industrial park not far from Hernandez’s home in North Attleborough Bristol Judge E  Susan Garsh narrowed the amount of evidence prosecutors can present during the trial  including the text messages Lloyd sent to his sister during his last minutes alive  The judge also barred testimony that prosecutors said would have shown that Lloyd’s killing followed a pattern of other shootings that Hernandez has been accused of committing In a separate case  Hernandez has pleaded not guilty to the fatal shootings of two men in Boston after a 2012 encounter at a nightclub in the city Still  the witness list in the Bristol County case remains long  according to court documents released Monday The court expects to draw from a pool of about 1 500 prospective jurors who will have to respond in writing to dozens of questions  Typically  16 jurors are selected — 12 who will deliberate and four alternates  But in this case  both defense and prosecutors have agreed to choose 18 prospective jurors  Court officials hope that seating two additional jurors will ensure there are enough people to deliberate if any juror is dismissed because of illness or other reasons The questionnaires that prospective jurors will be asked to complete have been impounded to make sure the jury pool is not tainted  Juror questioning — a process known as voir dire — will take place at sidebar  meaning it will be held in an open courtroom but at the judge’s bench out of earshot of the public and the media During voir dire  both prosecutors and defense attorneys can object to a prospective juror even if the judge has determined that the person can be impartial  Each side will get 18 objections  known as peremptory challenges  Defense layers argued that they should receive more peremptory challenges to guard against jurors who have been exposed to the tremendous media coverage of the case Garsh denied the request It is not unusual for jury questioning to happen out of earshot of the public  according to legal specialists “Because the questions are about the juror’s personal life ” said Elizabeth A  Lunt  president of the Massachusetts Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers  “The questions are about biases and prejudices that wouldn’t be appropriate to hear in an open courtroom ”Last week  Garsh set some ground rules for the trial — barring Patriots logos or any NFL gear or paraphernalia from the courtroom and setting the number of seats for media and spectators  n',

Basket rallies  where thousands of employees and their many supporters gathered to demand the return of ousted president Arthur T  Demoulas  The most recent rally  held last Friday  was probably the biggest one of all  Once again  the commitment of employees to fight for Demoulas and the kind of working life they know — which means good wages  job security  and a positive environment — was impressive  t nJust as striking  the empathy and support of so many customers who shopped elsewhere and then pasted their receipts onto the windows of boycotted Market Basket stores to make it clear how they felt While Market Basket employees rallied on Friday  another group of workers in the food business held a two day rally near Chicago  About 1 300 people who work at fast food restaurants around the country  including more than a dozen from the Boston area  promoted a nationwide campaign to raise the pay for those who serve you at McDonald’s  Dunkin’ Donuts  and a long list of other familiar chains Many of those people work for the minimum wage  or something close to it  Their simple message  We can’t live on this kind of money Often  they are young workers such as Darius Cephas  23  who says he makes $8 25 an hour working full time at a McDonald’s on Gallivan Boulevard in Boston  Cephas rents a room in Dorchester and lives paycheck to paycheck  He jumped at a chance to go to Chicago last week “I was tired of the same thing  working for nothing ” he said  “It was powerful  being with over 1 300 people fighting for the same cause ” t nYet the plight of fast food workersdoesn’t resonate much with customers  There are no throngs of people ready to hold up signs demanding change  no one seems prepared to boycott Most customers don’t connect with the people who serve them at fast food restaurants  unlike the circumstances at a Market Basket supermarket  They are replaceable workers with unfamiliar faces  They are poor with a paycheck  unlike some of their customers  nBut those people deserve your empathy  Many really are trying to make a living at these jobs  or at least squeak by  An industry that employs 4 million people across the country makes that nearly impossible Of course  the gathering near Chicago didn’t happen in a vacuum  A big union  the Service Employees International Union  was paying for most of the event  held just a few miles from the headquarters of McDonald’s Corp  The SEIU would surely like to unionize many of those fast food employees The rally was part of a campaign with an ambitious goal  to raise fast food wages to a minimum of $15 an hour A point of context  A new Massachusetts law will increase the state’s minimum wage to $11 an hour by 2017  from $8 per hour now  It’s among the most generous state wage laws in the country So $15 an hour is pie in the sky  Themost constructive development for fast food workers is the growing consensus in many states that the minimum wage needs to increase  In Massachusetts — and many other states — that’s what will actually put more money in those pockets Watching the Market Basket rallies of recent weeks  I thought I saw people who wanted to hold onto the good things we once took for granted  or at least considered common One was a sense of community in the stores we frequent  Lots of familiar faces and everyday low prices have always been a powerful combination at Market Basket Another was about jobs  You didn’t need a fancy degree to get a job at Market Basket that would pay the bills  help raise a family  and eventually provide a comfortable retirement  Those are the kind of American Dream jobs that have been disappearing for a long time now It’s hard to embrace all that and not acknowledge that working people on the lowest wage scales are barely getting by  Even that audacious goal of $15 per hour for full time fast food workers would amount to about $31 000 a year  less than the pay and bonus for experienced cashiers at Market Basket Terrell Lee  who works a couple of jobs and takes community college classes  went to Illinois last weekend and came home with a goal  “I want to improve my living status  pay my bills and live a normal life ” nA

202,,,,,,,,,"('For years  the state has violated a federal law that requires courthouses to protect juveniles from being verbally abused or threatened by adult prisoners in holding areas  resulting in penalties that slashed grant money intended for at risk youth programs This fall  a top Justice Department official issued a stern rebuke about the state’s failure to make any measurable improvements  t nNow   to deal with the issue  the state is preparing to apply for a federal grant that would cover half of the estimated $1 34 million needed to fix the 11 courthouses that an internal audit found had the most serious violations  including district courts in Dorchester  Hingham  and Quincy  according to Massachusetts Trial Court administrator Lewis H  “Harry” Spence  n“We’re moving as reasonably quickly as we can to get this situation solved ” said Spence  who called the problem “pretty large scale” in a telephone interview last week  nState officials have known about the problem since at least 1999  when a review of court facilities by the federal Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention reported concerns with “sight and sound” violations under the law  according to documents provided by the Justice Department in response to a records request  Under the sight and sound provision of the federal Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act  juveniles in custody are supposed to be shielded from seeing  hearing  or having any other contact with adult inmates When the problem had not been resolved by fiscal 2011  the Justice Department levied the first annual penalty against the state  Each penalty is a 20 percent cut in federal grants for programs designed to prevent juvenile delinquency Those cuts have added up to about $500 000 from fiscal 2011 through fiscal 2014  according to records from the Justice Department’s Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention In an October letter to Andrea Cabral  secretary of the state’s Executive Office of Public Safety and Security  Robert Listenbee  administrator for the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention  criticized the state for making no “measurable improvements” to comply with the law and  nrejected a request by Cabral to waive the penalties for fiscal years 2011 through 2013 Listenbee also criticized the state for not supplying a “reasonable time frame” for achieving full compliance  nThe state violations in 2011 through 2013 are “high and problematic ” Listenbee said in his October letter A spokesman for the Executive Office of Public Safety and Security said the department disagreed with Listenbee’s characterization  but would not air their concerns in the media Spokesman Terrel Harris directed questions about the state’s sight and sound compliance to the state’s court department “The issue is you have old buildings that have to be redone  that have to be remodeled  It’s just that simple ” said Harris Annual federal inspection reports from 2009 through 2013 estimated that Massachusetts violated the sight and sound provision in adult lockups nearly 200 times  The reports  however  provided no details on where these violations occurred Last year  Listenbee  who did not respond to repeated requests for comment  addressed the issue briefly at a juvenile justice conference in Boston “What happens when you have kids directly in contact with adults  They’re exploited ” he said in remarks during the September 2013 conference nthat were posted to YouTube  nSpence said that he is unaware of any incident in which a juvenile said he or she was traumatized by any contacts with adults due to the state’s noncompliance But no child  he said  should “be asked to have to deal with any of this ”“It’s not an issue of physical abuse ” he said  “It’s just what are people saying to juveniles  That is the biggest issue  the concern of shouts and catcalls         and ridicule ”At courts in Quincy  Leominster  and Barnstable  juveniles were cuffed to chairs or rails in view of adults  according to state audit reports And at Hingham District Court  juveniles could be “chained” to a heating pole when the cells were filled  and adults and young people were kept so close together that physical contact was possible and one officer expressed concern in a 2008 report “Per one officer ‘Juv  can be groped with ease ’ u2002” the report noted  nWhile court officers have cells under surveillance  juveniles could still be seen and harassed by incarcerated adults  said Spence “You could imagine         a young woman being held in that cell  what kind of catcalls and statements and yells and the like are being made to her by prisoners ” said Spence Spence said a 2013 audit of 59 courthouses across the state found 36 that had some level of violations  The 11 “high priority” courthouses include district courts in Barnstable  Attleboro  Waltham   nDudley  Fitchburg  and Leominster  along with Dukes County Courthouse and Lynn Juvenile Court In some courthouses  juvenile and adult proceedings have been held on alternating weekdays or times  at others  staff hung soundproofing curtains or used mesh screens to block the view of incarcerated adults  according to internal audits conducted from 2008 through 2012 Robert Gittens  head of the state’s juvenile justice advisory committee  which oversees how federal grant money is spent  said the penalties that have been  nimposed limit the money the state might be able to get   n“What it means is we can’t put out the proposals for funding that we might otherwise be able to do ” Gittens said   n nListenbee  in his letter to Cabral  said federal officials recognize the state’s antiquated court holding facilities are a challenge He said his office suggested options  such as dedicating specific court days each week for juveniles and relocating juvenile cases to facilities that can keep adults and young people separate “Certainly  if the state could use alternative facilities  perhaps with accommodations to address the state’s concerns with ‘access to justice ’ the problem could be addressed fully ” Listenbee wrote But Gittens said state officials have focused on keeping court facilities accessible for family members “If you have a juvenile living in one community  moving the session to another community makes it that much more difficult for his family and friends to be part of the process ” he said While most of the country is in compliance with the law  West Virginia  North Carolina  South Carolina  and Puerto Rico  in addition to Massachusetts  are currently being penalized for not fully complying with it  according to the Justice Department Other states that were cited for sight and sound violations in the past have met the requirements',

was more anxiety than joy  more concern about the unknown than relief  nThey were leaving the hospitals after 10 grueling weeks  but Bill and Denise Richard worried whether they were prepared to look after their Jane  who continued to require so much care  They also fretted about how they would fill the downtime  without all the doting care and the regimented schedules of the hospitals Returning home also meant sleeping across the hall from Martin’s vacant room  Bill had never entered what had become  for them  hallowed space on any of his brief visits to the house  And it had begun to feel like his decision in April to return only when they all could be there had been a defense mechanism  a way of delaying the inevitable reckoning — that their family would never be the same When Jane had met all her rehabilitation goals  and her room at home had been redone to be more accessible  the staff at Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital organized a farewell party  There were songs and tears and hugs  They would be leaving nurses who had become like family and a perch overlooking the water that had brought a measure of serenity On their way home in their Ford Explorer  the Richards stopped at the Ninety Nine in Charlestown  where the staff immediately recognized Jane  brought her an ice cream sundae  and refused to take the Richards’ money  Afterward  they picked up Henry  who had just come off a boat from fishing camp  and as they made their way back to Dorchester  Bill looked through the rearview mirror and began to feel the deep void in the back seat When they arrived at their 19th century slate gray Colonial  which they had spent years refurbishing  they found their yard had been raked and mulched  Newly planted flowers were in full bloom and there were freshly potted plants  ceramic birdhouses  and a geranium on the back porch  hanging on a prop adorned with Jane  Martin  and Henry’s names  All courtesy of Bill’s colleagues at work  There was also a fresh coat of paint on the house and a new alarm system  nBill carried Jane up the five granite steps of their front porch into the foyer  where nearly everything was as they had left it that morning in April  Martin’s bucket of baseballs  his glove and catcher’s equipment  his new baseball cleats and Reebok sneakers  all remained untouched  In the kitchen  Martin’s Red Sox backpack still hung a few feet from his now famous heart covered peace poster  Easter baskets remained on Martin’s desk and on the floor of Henry’s room  long after they should have been stowed away If Bill and Denise worried about sinking into a mire of gloom  Jane offered an antidote of levity When she saw her room  which had a new bed and bureau lower to the ground and fresh blue and yellow paint  she was ecstatic  She jumped up and down and hugged all her stuffed animals  except Bunny  who had been with her at the hospitals But there was a long way to go before they would feel at ease back in Dorchester  For one thing  they arrived shortly before the Fourth of July Bottle rockets  M 80s  The constant booms made them jittery and sleepless  triggering memories they longed to forget     nummers for the Richards had often meant a trip to the house they shared with relatives in New Hampshire  where the kids swam and hiked and played  But the idea of returning there without Martin was too much They needed new memories Inspired by the boats they saw from Spaulding  they took up sailing on the Charles River  The kids learned how to rig a boat and how to hold the wind on a tack  It was a peaceful respite — most of the time  Denise’s lack of peripheral vision made it a challenge to keep track of swinging objects  and when she wasn’t looking once  the boom slammed into her head  She laughed it off The more time Henry and Jane spent together  the more they squabbled over trivial things  like who would hold the tiller on the boat or where they would sit in the back seat of the car  Bill and Denise had worried how they would get along without their brother as a buffer  but the tiffs reflected how Henry was starting to see past his sister’s wounds  marking the return of some normalcy Through the summer  Henry remained busy with various day camps and appeared to be coping well  But unexpected things sent him into a funk  such as when he discovered a text message that Martin had sent him early in the morning on April 15 had disappeared  At random times  he would look forlorn and tell his parents  “I miss Martin ”Jane continued a regimen of potent drugs and adapted to the uneven floors at home  hopping around on crutches and ringing a bell at night if she needed to use the bathroom  She returned to Spaulding several times a week for physical therapy and went to Children’s Hospital every month for checkups At one appointment over the summer  doctors discovered a bone growth at the tip of her limb  It’s a common side effect of amputation  they said  but it also meant they might have to delay providing Jane a prosthesis for up to a year The news was disheartening for Bill and Denise  who were already struggling with the heaviness of their new lives  They were making regular visits to the mahogany  heart embossed cross marking Martin’s grave  less than a mile from their home  They also began sitting in his room  which would remain untouched for the next year  the Red Sox and Bruins posters remaining on his door Bill avoided parks in the neighborhood where he and Martin used to play ball  Denise joked that everyone they knew  including their deli clerk  was getting therapy to deal with Martin’s death — except them  They were too busy  they said  too focused on other things Bill  still in pain from an unsuccessful operation to repair his ruptured eardrums  continued to struggle making restaurant reservations for four and found himself instinctively grabbing five plates for dinner  having to put one back After a while  they were happy to see neighbors  but it wasn’t always comfortable  Some weren’t sure what to say to the Richards and felt strange talking about themselves  at times apologizing for carping about things that seemed so trivial by comparison  like a backache But Bill and Denise were buoyed by a steady flow of good will Friends brought meals  others left gifts  The community’s support was enormous  They received several million dollars raised for them directly and from the One Fund  the charity for Marathon bombing victims  The money was placed in trusts for Jane and Henry  There were gifts from celebrities  Taylor Swift sent a hand painted guitar  Patrice Bergeron of the Bruins donated an autographed hockey stick  They received flags flown at half staff on military bases in their honor  Someone even sent a bronze statue of Martin holding his peace poster Bill and Denise also began reading the thousands of letters from around the world  such as one that touched them deeply from a 9 year old boy from Pittsburgh  who included a medal he won after playing a flag football game “I told my dad that I wanted to play the game for Martin ” the boy wrote in a careful cursive on notebook paper  “I ran for a touchdown  threw a touchdown pass  and had an interception for a touchdown  I told my coach after the game that I played it for Martin  and my coach gave me the game medal  I wanted to give it to you  I hope you like it ”By August  they received good news  Jane’s orthopedist and prosthetist agreed they could build an artificial leg that would allow her to safely bear weight using her thigh  rather than her limb  where the skin remained raw Now Jane would be able to walk on two legs on her first day back at school  just as Bill and Denise had hoped     nfter missing the last months of first grade  Jane couldn’t wait to get back to school  She was eager to see all her friends and teachers Shortly before classes resumed  Jane and Denise went to meet the principal  They discussed Jane’s schedule and whether she would need a personal aide By late August  she had spent several weeks learning how to walk on her new prosthesis  a clumsy  exhausting process  It amazed her parents to see her ambling about  Still  it was precarious going  and Jane took her share of spills  The prosthesis was difficult to use compared with the more sophisticated artificial leg she would get later  She had to be prodded to wear it When the first day of school arrived  Jane had little interest in the symbolism of the moment  She was more concerned with dressing up for the special occasion  which to her meant wearing a skirt  She never showed the slightest hint of self consciousness about revealing her injured leg  which she called “Luvvy ”It also meant leaving her prosthesis at home  because she wanted to wear her favorite red cowboy boots  which didn’t fit on the artificial leg  She would instead walk into school on her crutches  wearing just one cowboy boot Jane also wore a locket necklace with angel wings inside — to keep Martin close to her heart  Her teachers marveled at her resilience  But they would keep a close watch on her  as would Denise from the library  and Jane agreed to take what they called regular “brain breaks” throughout the day to rest or chat with a social worker Jane didn’t dwell on her limitations and even hoped to play soccer that fall  But her differences from the other kids became evident at recess  when at first she was only allowed to play on the swings  which she insisted on pushing as high as she could go  Denise had to warn her not to jump off As time passed  she began wearing her prosthesis to school and leaving the crutches at home  She even began to run  which started as a skip and then as a kind of gallop  By winter  she was back playing basketball and attending dance classes A diligent student  Jane kept up with her homework — practicing her handwriting and grammar — and even wrote poems  “Peace is a special feeling ” she scrawled in one titled “Peace ” “It is a wonderful feeling to have  If you have never had the feeling of peace  that’s too bad ”She was so at ease with her plight that she performed a show and tell with her prosthesis  removing her sneaker to show classmates how she could paint the toenails  They asked her questions  especially the boys  and she patiently explained things like  yes  she could swim  and no  she couldn’t play soccer  at least not yet Jane brought a relief that few expected  but there were grief counselors for her brother’s friends at the start of school  as many of them still struggled with his absence     nill and Denise resisted efforts to make Jane into an emblem of resilience or of Boston Strong  Publicly celebrating her recovered vitality felt wrong  almost unseemly Even before they returned home  the Richards received offers to honor Jane  like many other survivors of the bombings During the Stanley Cup finals  the Bruins invited Jane to wave a flag on the ice before the sixth game  The crowd doubtlessly would have roared for her  the Richards knew  but it just wasn’t right  They couldn’t revel without Martin  who idolized the Bruins  regularly watched games with his dad  and would have given anything to stand on the ice Instead  with Jane’s cast decorated in the team’s colors  they quietly accepted an offer to slip into TD Garden with a police escort and watch the game from a suite with the arena’s CEO  When an image of their son unexpectedly appeared on the Jumbotron  Jane looked up and said  “Hey  there’s Martin’s picture ” Bill and Denise were taken aback A few months later  for the season opener at Gillette Stadium  the Patriots invited Jane to take the field for a pregame ovation with others wounded in the attack  But it was on a Thursday night  and Jane had school the next day  Bill and Denise also worried about exposing her to a national audience So Bill brought Henry  They entered the field through the player’s tunnel and planned to stay on the sidelines  expecting to remain anonymous  which was easy without Jane  Their first jolt came when the team took the field to an explosive fireworks display  Then  without any warning  Martin’s picture appeared on the Jumbotron  this time with an announcer saying his name before the large crowd  It was one of the first times Bill had heard Martin’s name spoken so publicly  and it caught him off guard  He and Henry held each other tight It was hard for the Richards to attend games without Martin  especially at Fenway Park But when the Red Sox reached the playoffs  the Richards decided to relent  The team asked Jane to appear with her youth choir to sing the national anthem before the second game of the American League Championship Series  As long as she wasn’t singled out  and the Red Sox didn’t alert the media in advance  they thought it would be fine Of course  Jane was unmistakable as soon as she walked on the field  and not just because of her leg  The team made “B Strong” shirts for all the kids in the choir  but Jane was wearing Martin’s Pedroia shirt and refused to change  So she took the field as the only singer in a jersey Somehow  she also ended up in front of the other kids  as if she were the lead singer  “What should we do ” Denise whispered to Bill  as they watched from the first base line  increasingly nervous Jane was liable to do anything  Denise worried she might start singing opera or the “Sun will come out tomorrow ”Their police escort  jokingly  offered to cut the mike But Jane led the choir with poise  even playing a glockenspiel  and they left without anyone seeming to notice — until pictures cropped up later on Twitter and local websites     ns the holidays approached  they felt Martin’s absence even more  nThe first challenge was getting through Halloween  which the kids always loved  particularly Martin  who was a glutton for candy  especially Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups Bill and Denise weren’t eager to welcome a parade of kids to their door and wondered whether fewer might turn up  as some neighbors shied away from their house  But they put on what they described as their “happy faces” and doled out chocolate bars and lollipops so quickly that they ran out early  Jane and Henry  even if unintentionally  evoked Martin  She reprised her brother’s zombie costume from the year before and he wore Pedroia’s jersey  trick or treating as a bearded Red Sox player As Thanksgiving approached  the Richards struggled with whether to go to Bill’s sister’s house in Danvers  as they usually did  They worried their presence would be hard on everyone So they decided to change things up by starting the day with the annual turkey trot jog through Franklin Park  Denise pushed Jane in a wheelchair  With a few hundred yards left  Jane insisted on getting up and running  a feat that drew loud cheers from the crowd as she limped across the finish line into Bill’s arms Afterward  they drove up to Danvers and felt the tension almost immediately  The kids — especially Martin — would ordinarily spend the afternoon throwing a football and playing in the yard  Not this year  Everyone stayed inside  They also skipped their tradition of having everyone in the family say what they were thankful for Bill decided  this time  something had to be said  To clear the air before dinner  he raised a glass  looked at his family  and managed  somehow  to get out the words  “To Martin ”As the cold returned  December loomed on the calendar  For years  they held a big party at their house on Christmas Eve  with neighbors and relatives stopping over for drinks  caroling  and gathering by their player piano to sing “The Twelve Days of Christmas ” The kids often went to bed early  eager for Santa to come This year  they abandoned their traditions  Instead  they boarded a train for Washington  D C  — they couldn’t fly because of the damage to Bill and Jane’s ears — and went to the White House  at the invitation of the Obamas  They were there for a holiday party and spent the afternoon walking through the West Wing and mingling  until the president and first lady arrived to greet everyone Afterward  they were escorted to the Map Room  where they met privately with the Obamas  The first lady asked Jane how she was feeling and complimented her on her navy bow dress and her pearls  which were another gift from Taylor Swift  They talked about school and sports  and Jane began playing with the chiffon dress worn by the first lady  who began stroking Jane’s hair  just as she did at the hospital When the president asked Jane what her favorite part of the White House was  she answered  “the decorations ”The president joked in response  “I was up all night setting them up ”Before they left  the Richards signed postcards to pledge acts of community service to honor the sacrifices of military families  Jane wrote that she promised to clean her room for 21 weeks  signing her postcard  “Be Safe  Peace  Love  Jane ”When school vacation started  they left the city again  They found a room at a New Hampshire hotel they hadn’t been to before and brought a small plastic Christmas tree  which they decorated with their own ornaments The change rattled the kids  who wondered whether they would have to leave Boston every year at Christmas  But Henry was appeased when he heard they would go skiing  and Jane perked up after her parents explained that Santa would visit the hotel  too Jane had asked Santa for a running leg  a special prosthesis with a springy hook for a foot  while Henry hoped for new track shoes and a running watch  Their wishes came true  though Jane would have to wait a while to get hers On Christmas Eve  they all dressed up  enjoyed a big meal at the hotel  and swapped stories about Martin For Bill and Denise  it was good to sit around and relax for the first time in months  It wasn’t until a few days later  after they returned home  that what they were trying to escape caught up with them  especially for Denise It was New Year’s Eve  when the Richards would often be on Boylston Street to watch the First Night parade  Denise was picking up sausages at the butcher shop for breakfast the next morning when she heard a few people talking about how they couldn’t wait for the end of 2013 Their words struck a nerve  As awful as it was for her family  the idea of leaving 2013  of moving on to a new year  felt deeply unsettling It felt like leaving Martin behind     nn the oversized binders on the table in front of Bill and Denise were more than 250 applications  from 35 states and as far away as Asia  Europe  and South America  from people who wanted to run the Marathon in Martin’s honor  They came from a member of Congress  a Hollywood producer  a dozen CEOs  firefighters  nurses  teachers  students The applicants offered detailed answers to a long list of questions  some written by Henry and Jane  One mom wrote about how she ironed a patch on her 8 year old son’s baseball uniform as a tribute to Martin  The Richards “should be going to  their son’s  Little League games  too ” she wrote  A father reflected on the pain he experienced after losing an 8 year old cousin  “I saw what our family went through ” he wrote After all the money collected from lemonade stands and step dancing troupes  all the gift baskets and notes left on their porch  all the random acts of kindness that came their way  Bill and Denise learned how much giving could be a source of healing With the Marathon only a few months away  they decided it was the optimal time to launch their foundation  The Boston Athletic Association had offered them a host of valuable charity bibs  which would help them raise a significant amount of money  It was an opportunity they felt they couldn’t pass up  even if it meant dredging up deep emotions They had already met with lawyers and drawn up the documents  built a website  and found help to start the team  Their mission  refined since the meeting in their dining room a few months before  was to honor Martin by supporting the things he loved  sports  education  and the community At the end of January  the Richards and their inner circle of John  Erin  and Larry met at a Hyatt in Braintree with their new team manager  Susan Hurley  a former Patriots cheerleader who helped charities raise money for the Marathon As they flipped through the hefty binders  Denise and Bill emphasized they weren’t looking for who could raise the most money  they wanted runners who would make the best ambassadors for the foundation After several hours of debate  they ni  applications that focused too much on defying the terrorists and others that seemed self serving  They grew tired of reading about “that poor family ” They wanted their 50 bibs — which were hard to come by — to go to those who clearly felt compelled to run in Martin’s honor  Sincerity was a deciding factor “If they don’t know Martin’s story  forget it ” Larry said Bill added  “You can tell who was denied elsewhere ”Eventually  they would choose more than a dozen runners from Dorchester and others from 15 states  including wounded veterans and first responders  The team would eventually grow to 100 runners  among the Marathon’s largest Two weeks later  the Richards mustered the will to throw a party for their team  which they held at the State Street Pavilion overlooking the field at Fenway Park  Many of the out of state runners flew in  A number of VIPs attended It was an uncomfortably public moment for them  and the kids  as they found themselves accepting condolences in something like a receiving line  But they accepted it as something they had to do for the foundation  They had support from friends and family  including Father Sean  who began the evening by reading a prayer about peace and telling the team what it took for the Richards to join them “Where there is horror and darkness in the world  you teach us to turn to the light ” he said  “You teach us to draw close to the light and to push away the darkness — in fact  to conquer it  That’s why we’re here tonight ”Mayor Martin J  Walsh  a neighbor who had known the family for years  was there and showed the team a bracelet he had been wearing in Martin’s honor for months and thanked the Richards  “You lift up the whole city ” he said  “This is what Boston needs ”When Bill finally stepped to the podium  he spoke through tears  “We knew that we would do something to honor Martin  but it never occurred to us that we’d be here tonight  so soon  even before the first anniversary ” he said He explained why they started the foundation  “It became clear to us over the last few months that we would not run from the  Marathon  but embrace it to help us heal  to honor my son and his message  and to pay it forward ”He ended by recalling that day on Boylston Street  when Martin asked his parents how old he had to be to run the Marathon  and how he had promised one of his teachers he would run with her when he was old enough  That teacher was on the team  too Bill urged the runners to think about Martin as they trudged up Heartbreak Hill and to whoop it up in his honor when they crossed the finish line “His first marathon is yours ” he told them     nhe following months were a whirlwind of supporting the team and ordering gear  monitoring the fund raising  and securing sponsors  Overseeing the foundation had become something of a full time job for them — Bill remained on leave and Denise was working part time — but they had many other concerns Jane still had regular medical appointments and was recovering from yet another operation — her 15th — to close the perforations in her right eardrum  She would require additional surgeries over the years to manage the growth of her limb Henry suffered a blow when his beloved betta fish Hank — who survived their long absence from home with the help of neighbors — bellied up one day in the kitchen  But he took the loss much better than his parents expected and used the occasion to prod them for something he wanted deeply “Now can I get a dog ” he pleaded  The answer was no  and remained so even after Jane promised to walk it every day and wash the dishes for three weeks The strain of it all sometimes got to Denise  who managed her stress with long walks  It was hard having to rely on friends and Bill to take her anywhere from the hairdresser to the supermarket  One day  when her frustration peaked  she grabbed her keys and tried to drive off in her Volvo station wagon  But  perhaps fortunately  the battery was dead Nearly a year later  after a second operation to repair his damaged left eardrum  Bill’s hearing had improved slightly but the ringing had become intolerable  He was managing it now through medication and meditation  but the tinnitus would still occasionally surge It wasn’t all gloom In February  they celebrated when Henry turned 12  even though they had to talk him out of taking a polar plunge off Tenean Beach  as he did after New Year’s  For Jane’s eighth birthday  which was on Valentine’s Day  they hosted a gingerbread making party at a nearby bakery  which had raised thousands of dollars for the Richards by selling peace cookies in Martin’s honor A month later  the Richards drove to United Prosthetics  a century old family business in Dorchester  where Jane took her first bouncy steps on her new running leg  She was ecstatic and wore it to school  She didn’t want to take the “cheetah” leg off  “It’s like giving a kid a driver’s license ” her prosthetist said  warning her to go easy Perhaps the best news came soon afterward  when the Richards logged on to a city website and learned that Henry had been accepted to Boston Latin School  which was like getting into Harvard for a sixth grader in the public schools  He was one of only about 500 students in the city to receive such an honor To congratulate him  Jane drew balloons on signs she posted around the house  which read  “Good Job Henry ”They began some long pondered renovations to their house  creating an office for the foundation on the third floor and refurbishing the basement into a playroom All the activity provided a distraction  which they welcomed  even though it raised concerns about what would happen when things quieted down  “I worry about when the music stops ” Bill said     ntill  there was the inescapable weight  dark thoughts that continued to gnaw When Bill needed relief  he would head upstairs to the sitting room  light a cedar pine candle  and meditate  concentrating on his breathing He would focus on the moment — the present — to banish the memories that still came out of nowhere  even if they didn’t hit him every few minutes  as they did in the beginning  Then he would begin reciting the Peace Prayer of Saint Francis He’d say it again and again Lord  make me an instrument of your peace  Where there is hatred  let me sow love  Where there is injury  pardon          nThe sound of the second bomb was different than the deep thud of the first  It was higher pitched and earsplitting  Suddenly  everything had slowed down and there was a deafening silence Bill was blown into the street and staggered as blood dripped from his legs  In a fog  he peered into the smoke and thought  What happened  Where is everyone  Where is my family  Denise had been knocked to the ground  beneath a pile of people  and felt a wetness trickling from her right eye Henry was holding his head  saying  “Mama  my head  My ears ”She tried to calm him  still unsure of what just happened  “It’s OK ” she said  “We’re going to go now ”Then he looked at her  “Mama  your eye ”Denise turned around and saw Martin  He was lying on the sidewalk  Strangers were trying to help him  They were bringing ice from a nearby restaurant  They were flagging down paramedics  who arrived quickly but found that his pulse had vanished from everywhere but his neck Where there is doubt  faith  Where there is despair  hope  Where there is darkness  light  And where there is sadness  joy          nDenise knelt by Martin while Henry brought Bill to Jane  who was in shock and clearly suffering  Her hair was burned so badly that she looked like a boy  Bill carried her across the street  where a man took off his belt and wrapped it around Jane’s leg Bill pulled Henry close to him  trying to shield him “Is this really happening ” Henry asked With others helping Jane  Bill began to search for Denise and found her beside Martin  He looked at his son  who was more like him than anyone else in the world  and knew right away For it is in giving that we receive  It is in pardoning that we are pardoned  And it is in dying that we are born to eternal life     nill and Denise knew little about Dzhokhar Tsarnaev  who was accused of dropping a backpack on the ground a few feet from Martin  They didn’t even know how to pronounce his name  and preferred it that way They had no energy to waste on anger  they said  and spent little time thinking about who or why anyone would do such a thing  They knew  in the end  there was no rational explanation They told Henry and Jane that they shouldn’t be worried about anyone else trying to attack them  They weren’t targeted specifically  they explained  it was just happenstance  They were standing in the wrong place at the wrong time The Richards had mi  feelings about attending the trial  “The sooner it’s over  the better ” Denise said  “The longer it drags out  the worse it is for our family ”Bill added  “I don’t have interest in being there  But if we were given any indication that our testimony or presence was necessary  we’d be all in  Until we’re given that  we’re moving forward ”Their main concern had already been put to rest  The suspects no longer posed a threat “I’m not sure where we’d be emotionally now if these two guys weren’t caught ” he said     ns April approached  administrators at Jane’s school decided to mark the anniversary by having the students do service projects  Jane’s teacher asked whether she would take a leadership role in the second grade  and she was flattered “I’ve always wanted to be a leader ” she said So she stood before her class and explained how something scary happened last year  how a lot of people were injured  “As you know  my family was there ” she said  “and I got hurt ”In honor of Martin  she said they would make hers a peace project  At home that night  after finishing her homework and with her new mission in mind  Jane went to the cellar door in the kitchen  where Martin’s peace poster was still hanging  It had the word “love” written twice on it now  and there were more hearts and peace symbols  reflecting her brother’s finished work Jane looked at it and thought it would make an excellent prop for her new project  So she took it off the wall  folded it up  and packed it in her backpack When she told her mother later  matter of factly  that she was taking Martin’s poster to school the next day  Denise was floored  She explained to her daughter it would be better to leave it at home and took it back for safekeeping  The poster had become her son’s emblem  the core of the family’s fledging foundation  perhaps the ultimate symbol of the tragedy of the bombings Still  Bill and Denise remained wary of the relentless focus on them In the weeks before the Marathon  with officials expecting record crowds to line the course in a show of defiance  everyone seemed to want to know what they would do With a team of 100 runners who had raised more than $850 000 by early April for their foundation  they had a lot invested  There were many people to cheer for  many to thank At the least  the Richards planned to take part in the city’s tribute on the anniversary of the attack  six days before the Marathon  That would mean a trip back to Boylston Street  under police escort  perhaps the closest they would come to where they were standing that day They would also field a separate team of 150 runners — their junior varsity squad — to take part in the BAA’s annual 5K that Saturday  That would mean Bill  Denise  Henry  and possibly Jane  as well as many of their relatives and friends  would join thousands of others running the final leg of the Marathon  making the famous right on Hereford and left on Boylston  across the finish line Afterward  they planned to join other bombing survivors for a tribute run around Boston Common  and then have the kids take part in the same relay race on Boylston Street they had competed in in previous years  with Martin Jane  however  had experienced a recent setback  Her parents found blisters on her limb  requiring her prosthetist to make adjustments to her artificial legs  So she was back on crutches and using a wheelchair They wouldn’t prod her to play a role “She will only do it if it feels right ” Bill said  “We wouldn’t put her out there as a statement ”The day before the race would be Easter  a time for reflection and spiritual renewal What would come next for them  they didn’t know They would wait for the right moment to decide  Whatever they did  they said  it would be with the kids  All three of them', '2014_759')",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

an astonishing outpouring of grief  compassion  media coverage  and money  In the year since   and we have seen   u2009  u2009  almost nothing  Why To even ask that question  to draw the comparison  may seem almost sacrilegious  Yet it is being asked    by some who look at the extraordinary consideration given to those who suffered in the bomb blasts — the best of health care  millions of dollars of donations — and wonder why the same treatment  resources  and concern have not come their way  One Boston  they wonder  or two  nThere are reasons why April 15  2013  was sui generis for Boston  Yet there should be lessons too  Sometimes  out of the media spotlight and largely unseen  it’s too easy to ignore the daily tragedies occurring in our backyards  Just because they’re commonplace shouldn’t make them acceptable The impact  the importance  of the bombings lies not simply in the number of lives lost  If body count were the measure of a calamity    which occurred just two days later and killed many more  would have captured much more attention  It didn’t  nor did numerous horrendous events that have occurred since then   nRather  the bombings resonated so profoundly because they were an attack not on individuals but upon an entire city — an entire region  really  If  by some miracle  no one had died that day  it would have been equally awful  That’s the nature of terrorism  to put people in fear of their lives and by doing so to disrupt  destabilize  and undermine an entire society How does a society respond to such an attack  Boston is perhaps a textbook example  Instead of falling apart  the city came together  Instead of hiding in fear  its citizens made it a point to be out and on the street  as the unprecedented crowds of this year’s Marathon will doubtless attest  And all of the little things people did — making donations  sending cards and letters — were a way  in the antiseptic language of psychology  of processing the trauma  of demonstrating that  when we are all attacked  we all will come together to protect and care for each other  “B strong” went the slogan  and it’s not an exhortation that somehow made our bodies less vulnerable to physical harm  Rather  it’s one that gave us courage and restored our spirit  nBoston is not alone for having faced such a trial  of course  New York did in 2001  So too did New Orleans in 2005 and Haiti in 2010  albeit each from natural disasters  And  in each case  Americans reached out  FEMA’s sluggishness notwithstanding  to support those affected  It didn’t matter whether the victims were rich  poor  white  or black  It was the sense of a city or nation in mortal peril that provoked such deep caring and empathy Seen in that context  the Marathon Day bombings appear quite different from the unrelenting barrage of shootings in Boston’s poorer areas  One was an attack on us all  the second is the far too common taking of lives And yet  ponder whether in truth there really is all that much difference A shooting doesn’t just kill or injure its intended target  It wreaks havoc on families and friends  of course  and begins to spread fear as others wonder what’s next  And when the shootings keep on coming  they’re like a cancer eating away at a neighborhood  Terrorism is a sudden attack on a people  The scourge of violence in Mattapan  Roxbury  and parts of Dorchester is a slow motion kind of terrorism  if you will  Because it happens gradually  one victim after another  it’s less visible  less shocking  That makes it easy to become inured  seeing these crimes as just a regrettable fact of life  We need to resist that temptation  Evil that would destroy a community deserves equal outrage  whether perpetrated on Boylston Street or Humboldt Avenue',

who immediately attacked Philip Chism grabbed the woman by the throat  stabbed her with a pencil  and punched her repeatedly in the face and head  prosecutors said  t nIn its planning and execution  the June 2 assault was frighteningly similar to the October 2013 rape and slaying of 24 year old Colleen Ritzer in a bathroom in Danvers High School  where she was a teacher and Chism a student But this time the victim survived  saved by co workers who heard her screams Chism  15  was arraigned in Boston Juvenile Court as a youthful offender Wednesday  accused of attacking a female clinician at the facility where he was being held  Suffolk Assistant District Attorney Mark Zanini said Chism and the unnamed woman had known each other for months  She had been working at the Department of Youth Services facility in Dorchester  where Chism was awaiting trial on charges that he killed Ritzer “The defendant’s intent to murder in this case was proven not only by his conduct on June 2  2014 ” Zanini said  “His intent to murder was proven by his conduct in October 2013 ”Chism has pleaded not guilty to Ritzer’s killing  In court Wednesday  the 6 foot 2 teen  dressed in a blue Oxford shirt and khaki pants  kept his head bowed low and his shoulders hunched as Zanini read the allegations against him  t nChism’s mother  Diana  sat behind him  her face obscured by sunglasses  her head also bowed Denise Regan  Chism’s court appointed lawyer  did not argue against bail  which was set at $250 000 Pleas of not delinquent — the juvenile court equivalent of a not guilty plea — were entered on his behalf  Chism was charged with attempted murder by strangulation  assault with intent to murder  kidnapping  and two counts of assault and battery with a dangerous weapon in the June attack Zanini gave a detailed account of the investigation  which was aided in large part by video cameras at the Dorchester facility On June 2  Chism  who had been refusing to attend classes  was sitting at a table in a room outside his cell  studying  A male DYS staff member  whose job is to monitor the room  was sitting at a desk behind an eye level wall  immersed in paperwork The staff member failed to notice when Chism moved to a seat closer to the staff hallway  where residents are forbidden from going unless they have permission The young clinician walked by  Chism looked at her  then glanced at the staff worker to see whether he was paying attention  Zanini said The woman walked into a staff locker room and then into the bathroom Chism  holding a pencil in one hand  took off his sandals and kept an eye on the male worker  according to Zanini “The staff member was buried in his work ” Zanini said Chism crouched down  moved past the counter  which blocked him from the worker  and  still crouched  sneaked into the hallway toward the locker room  according to the prosecutor’s account As soon as the woman opened the door  Chism allegedly wrapped his hands around her neck  choking her with such force that she was unable to scream  Chism pushed her against a cinderblock wall as she struggled  Zanini said Then  Zanini said  Chism took one hand from her neck and started punching her  which took pressure off her windpipe  The woman was finally able to scream  Zanini said When co workers rushed in  they found Chism pummeling the woman  Zanini continued  They pulled Chism off  and the woman ran out of the room  gasping for air There was a rip in her shirt and on her back a “small hole  round in shape ’’ Zanini said  The woman declined medical attention Chism seemed psychotic  “screaming incoherently  and  foaming at the mouth ” according to a document filed by DYS in Salem Superior Court  The agency had requested that Chism undergo a psychiatric evaluation after the June 2 assault Chism was sent to the Worcester Recovery Center and Hospital  where Essex prosecutors  who are pursuing the murder charges in Danvers  asked for strict security measures Prosecutor Kate Berrigan MacDougall told a Superior Court judge after the attack that she was especially worried about any women at the facility “I’m not aware of anything that would prevent Mr  Chism from doing exactly what he did on the second  and creeping out of an area and attacking a female staff by herself ” said MacDougall State health officials said at that time that Chism would not be alone with staff members  would have his own room  and that at night  staff members would sit at his door  Male staff members would escort him to the bathroom Alec Loftus  a spokesman for DYS  declined to say whether the staff worker who was supposed to be watching Chism on June 2 was disciplined  nor would he elaborate on any new security measures made at the Dorchester facility “The Department of Youth Services conducted a comprehensive review of this incident and took action to enhance our security procedures to ensure staff and youth are safe at all times ” Loftus said in an e mail  He added that

Tomato vines as tall as a fairy tale beanstalk climb up an ingenious pulley system in a greenhouse flanked by garages and a disused basketball hoop  The vanguard of Greater Boston’s locavore movement may well be in places like this small Roxbury farm  where abandoned lots and pocket plots train tomorrow’s farmers  feed the hungry  and supply some of the city’s trendiest restaurants  na Roxbury nonprofit in its 23rd growing season  operates all along the food chain  from seed to fork  It supplies nutritious  locally grown produce to an arc of consumers  from food stamp recipients to urban epicures  And it touches on a full course of issues  from public health to community development to environmental justice  The result is a sort of completeness that mirrors the cycles of nature  even as it addresses mostly man made ills  t nBeginning Monday  78 teenagers of all socio economic backgrounds will start Seed Crew  a six week youth development program that uses sustainable agriculture as its foundation  Kids from Lexington and Marblehead will join their peers from urban neighborhoods they may never have visited  They get a stipend to work mornings in the project’s eight growing sites in Greater Boston and the North Shore  from the Dudley Square greenhouse to a tiny plot in Lynn to a 31 acre farm in Lincoln  They help to raise the 250 000 pounds of tomatoes  squash  and field greens that will eventually be donated to hunger relief organizations  sold in neighborhood farmers markets  offered as Community Supported Agriculture shares  and supplied to restaurants like Henrietta’s Table in Cambridge or Hamersley’s in the South End Afternoons are spent in a robust curriculum of leadership and team building workshops  plus discussions of food equity  environmental sustainability  and race  class  and gender roles  “We are very intentional about the youths we hire ” said Charu Gupta  communications manager at The Food Project  “We try to really get a final group that reflects the kind of thoughtful  productive  diverse community we want to see in the world ’’Parts of Roxbury  especially around Dudley Square  are redeveloping rapidly  but the best urban

these two neighborhoods have more fast food restaurants per capita than all other Boston neighborhoods combined  The need for alternatives is obvious Because prices in Greater Boston are higher than the national average  a federal food stamp dollar doesn’t stretch as far  So in 2008  The Food Project helped pilot a program to allow electronic benefit cards to be used at farmers markets  where the food is not only fresher  but often cheaper than what can be found in urban “food deserts ” The group also helps build raised beds and backyard gardens for low income families Urban farming is a hot topic in depressed cities like Detroit  where vast swaths of vacant land are being repurposed  But leaders in Boston are also taking note  In December  the Boston Redevelopment Authority  of the city

Project is about more than food  On West Cottage Street in Roxbury  a 1 4 acre abandoned lot was an overgrown eyesore in dire need of development  But the most common solution — to create a park — was rejected by neighbors who knew that passive parks too often become dangerous gathering spots  An urban farm attracts more eyes and hands invested in the property  making it not just attractive but safe  “The common parlance around urban farming is that it’s an economic development program ” said Gupta  “What we have seen is more quality of life issues ” including beautification  public safety

for help was the office of her daughter’s pediatrician  Dr  John S  Maypole  A social worker in the office helped Rodriguez apply for shelter and supplied her with gift cards to buy clothes and other necessities  When the hotel where Rodriguez and her daughter were staying triggered severe allergies in her daughter  Maypole helped get the family into a healthier location   t n“I felt I was stronger with them being there ” Rodriguez said  “He was not only my daughter’s doctor  When I needed him to speak to anyone  he’s been here ”Today  Rodriguez  32  has settled into an apartment  Her daughter  Aneixi  now 4  is in enrolled in Head Start and doing well — even though she was born 14 weeks premature  weighing only 2 pounds Clothes  shelter  the mother’s stress — are these the doctor’s job  Certainly a family’s struggles can affect the children’s health  And when a child is already sick and vulnerable  that effect is magnified That’s why Maypole’s practice  the Comprehensive Care Program at Boston Medical Center  includes staff to help with nonmedical issues  His patients are considered “complex”  they have multifaceted medical problems  such as Down syndrome  sickle cell disease  neurodevelopmental disorders  genetic disorders  or severe asthma  Many were born prematurely  They also often have parents who are dealing with disability  domestic violence  substance abuse  or homelessness  Homelessness can be especially tough on a child like Aneixi  because she was so premature  which left her lungs vulnerable  Living in a place that made her wheeze was a threat to her health  When Maypole sees a patient  often the medical concerns take the least time  He might need just a few minutes to adjust a kid’s asthma medication  for example  but then he learns the rest of the story  which he says might go something like this  “They live in a shelter  People in the shelter smoke  They’ve been placed in Waltham  It’s a brittle child that really should not be that far out  The mom has a domestic violence issue and  by the way  they don’t have a crib and they don’t have a feeding chair  And they have since lost their connection to Early Intervention because they were placed in a shelter in Waltham and they were originally in Roxbury  I see that every day “The medical piece I could probably do by phone ” Maypole said  But the nonmedical issues  “That’s a face to face situation that requires multiple touches ”For those touches  the two physicians in the Comprehensive Care Program  are backed up by a nurse  a nurse practitioner  a licensed social worker  and a family navigator  The navigator  a new kind of health professional  follows up with parents to make sure things are going as they should — that the family was successful at contacting social service agencies or understands the care plan  for example In addition to social supports  the program has established connections within Boston Medical Center for better access to specialists  “If a child has a need ” Maypole said  “our practitioners are amenable to either a quick consult  or adding them on to their schedules ”The other day  Maypole recalled  “I had a family who were panicking over a developmental concern  The developmental clinic was booking months out ” But the neurologist connected with Maypole’s practice agreed to squeeze in the patient that day  to begin the process of evaluation Nine year old Sofia Pignataro is another “complex” child  born with Down syndrome and heart defects  She initially developed normally for a child with Down  learning to talk and identify colors  But around age 3  said her mother  Lucy Pignataro  “Everything that she had gained  just stopped  and there was no explanation ”When Pignataro’s husband got a job as managing director of the Global Jazz Institute at the Berklee School of Music about five years ago  the family moved to Boston  That’s when tests at Boston Children’s Hospital’s yielded the answer  Sofia also has autism Her mother was devastated  “With Down syndrome  I knew what to expect of my daughter and what I hoped for  But with autism you have no clue          It was like a brick wall ”At Maypole’s Comprehensive Care Program  Pignataro got some help climbing that wall “When I first went to see  Maypole  there  it was a totally new experience ” she said  A nurse interviewed Pignataro in depth  and offered help with such issues as schooling “You feel like you’re more than somebody coming in with a sick kid that needs a pill ” Pignataro said  “They want to get to know you  They want to know how they can help you be a better parent to your kid and get your child everything that they might need ”Maypole’s program serves children in the greater Boston area  but starting in December  it will start to reach out statewide  Boston Medical Center recently won a three year  $6 1 million Health Care Innovation Award from the US Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to establish the Massachusetts Alliance for Complex Care  In collaboration with the Baystate Medical Center in Springfield  the alliance will bring the kind of care that Rodriguez and Pignataro experienced to 500 additional families around the state  testing what they’re calling the Collaborative Care Coordination and Consultative Model for Complex Kids  the 4C  or “Foresee” Program  Under the plan  Maypole and Dr  Matthew D  Sadof of Baystate will serve as consultants to community pediatricians on how to care for children with complex issues  The children will stay with their current pediatricians  but will come to BMC or Baystate to be assessed and to develop a care plan  The alliance will also provide the back up services of nurses  social workers  nutritionists  and navigators  The program will hire about a dozen people As part of the project  Sadof and Maypole plan to address a bedeviling problem  difficulty accessing a child’s complete  up to date medical record when the many providers have incompatible computer systems  Today  they have to wait for medical notes to come over by fax The alliance wants to create a secure  cloud based system that will allow parents and authorized professionals to read all the medical records at once  perhaps even on their smartphones  “We’re really looking at interoperability as a centerpiece of this ” Sadof said  Additionally  the program will share data with MassHealth  the state’s Medicaid program  and all the insurers that have managed care contracts with MassHealth  “We feel the cost savings will more than pay for itself ” Sadof said  And that could open the door to continuing the program after the three years are up  Kathryn Quinn  a nurse practitioner in the school based health center at the Blackstone Innovation School  a Boston elementary school  is thrilled that Maypole’s program will expand  Her school serves children with multiple disabilities  About a fifth of them are Maypole’s patients  but all could benefit from the enhanced services his program offers The children in her school get plenty of specialized medical care  Quinn said  What they lack is someone to coordinate it  “You have multiple hands in the pot and sometimes people don’t know what the others are doing ” Quinn said  They also need someone to help with all the nonmedical problems that affect health  such as the child who has to be carried up and down the stairs from his third flood apartment because the building cannot accommodate the youngster’s wheelchair  “Having this additional funding ” Quinn said  “will really improve care coordination for these kids  Hopefully it will improve the child’s overall health and wellness ”', '2014_186')",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Muslim instantly became the only part of his identity that seemed to matter  kids at his school in Lynn besieged him with questions he could not answer  He had immigrated to the United States from Pakistan at age 3  but he no longer felt allowed to call himself American A year ago  after the Boston Marathon bombings  Syed braced himself for another anti Muslim backlash  It never happened  n“I grew up being an outsider  feeling like an outsider  and there wasn’t any moment really after the Boston Marathon where I had that feeling of being an outsider again ” he said  “I grieved with everyone          I could understand their feelings  and they could understand mine  without there being an asterisk next to it ”On Monday  Syed expects to run the Boston Marathon for the first time  an act he sees as an expression of his love for his resilient city and for its embrace of diversity “That is what the Boston Marathon this year is really going to be about ” he said  “I want to say that I was there  that I took part in it ”To be sure  there were isolated displays of Islamophobia in the aftermath of the Marathon bombings  A woman wearing a hijab was assaulted on a street in Malden  Strangers sent hateful e mails to Boston’s mosques  Some Muslims feared being questioned by law enforcement or seethed over a tabloid’s portrayal of two innocent Massachusetts men as possibly connected to the bombings But the broader tableau showed a city that has become more welcoming of Muslims in the years since the 2001 attacks  many local Muslims said  The scale of the two tragedies was very different  but many Muslims said improved interfaith cooperation and increasingly diverse schools and workplaces contributed to a change in tone  It also seemed  they said  that their non Muslim neighbors had grown more knowledgeable and less fearful in a dozen years of discussing terrorism  war  national security  and religious liberty in the public square  n“Now  when an act of terror occurs  people can see it for what it is  someone exploiting religion  someone with serious issues ” said Jalon Fowler  a 38 year old Muslim who ran in last year’s Marathon and will compete again this year After the Marathon bombings  many Muslims said they felt reassured by gestures of support and concern from friends and coworkers  from local politicians and clergy of other faiths  Bostonians  they said  seemed to understand that most Muslims were as horrified at the violence on Boylston Street as everyone else was “There is never a silver lining to mass murder  or attempted mass murder ” said Imam William Suhaib Webb  spiritual leader of the Islamic Society of Boston Cultural Center in Roxbury  the city’s largest mosque  “But what we learned is  this is a really great city with incredibly sincere people “It was like  we’re together  we all anguish about what happened  and we are going to try to speak to the problem together ” nGreater Boston’s two most prominent mosques were inundated with press calls and television cameras after the bombings  especially the Islamic Society of Boston in Cambridge  where suspects Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev occasionally worshipped Ismail Fenni  acting imam of the Cambridge mosque  tried to field reporters’ questions and to respond to the stunned congregation  few of whom had known the Tsarnaevs “We were worried the name and the reputation of the mosque would be stained ” Fenni said in a recent interview Those fears eased as neighbors lent support in calls and e mails  A couple of weeks after the tragedy  the mayor of Cambridge and other officials led a peace walk from City Hall to the mosque The Roxbury mosque was also caught up in a media barrage that turned ugly when USA Today and Fox News suggested the mosque was cultivating extremism But  here too  the community offered a balm  Neighbors sent notes   nFelix G  Arroyo  then councilor at large  spoke at the mosque’s vigil for bombing victims  Messages of support from Jewish and Christian clergy poured in A series of important moments in interfaith relations in Boston followed  The Friday after the manhunt in Watertown  Rabbis Ronne Friedman and Jeremy S  Morrison of Temple Israel and the Rev  Burns Stanfield  president of the Greater Boston Interfaith Organization  offered prayers and words of solidarity at the Roxbury mosque’s midday prayer service In January  Webb made history by preaching at Temple Israel’s annual Shabbat service honoring the Rev  Martin Luther King Jr   becoming the first imam to formally address the city’s largest synagogue  Nearly 1 000 Jews  Christians  and Muslims lingered long afterward to eat  chat  and even join in a little traditional Israeli dancing Nancy Khalil  a doctoral candidate in social anthropology at Harvard and a former Islamic Cultural Center leader  marveled at the warmth  Years ago  in the same place  she remembered “trying to explain who we really are  in these really anxious  tense meetings” with Jewish leaders  who were then trying to reconcile their desire for better interfaith relations with their communities’ concerns about a mosque founder’s anti Semitic statements and alleged extremist ties “It was an unbelievable moment for me  and it was really indicative of the type of relationships that we now have across institutions and across communities ” Khalil said  “Because it wasn’t just the leaders being welcoming        It was everybody in that temple being welcoming  And that Muslims were comfortable staying there and mingling afterwards  that was telling ”On the evening of the bombing anniversary  Webb was a featured speaker at a gathering for “Remembrance and Hope” at Old South Church  The Rev  Nancy S  Taylor  Old South’s senior minister  personally invited Webb’s congregation to the service  She spoke at the end of last week’s Friday prayers at the Roxbury mosque  becoming the first woman to ever speak in that forum Boston’s clergy have been working to build better interfaith networks since the September 2001 attacks  through formal channels like the Greater Boston Interfaith Organization  and informal ones  like a get to know you group of Jewish  Christian  and Muslim leaders that began meeting months before the bombings This year’s milestones  Taylor says  are “the fruit of conversations that have been going on a long time ” nThe mosques and local law enforcement leaders have also nurtured a working relationship  After the bombings  said Yusufi Vali  executive director of the Islamic Society of Boston Cultural Center  leaders of the Cambridge mosque contacted the FBI to share information about Tamerlan Tsarnaev’s two outbursts at Friday services  As the investigation proceeded  Muslim leaders worked with civil rights lawyers to set up a hotline for Muslims seeking legal counsel “This institution played a critical role in ensuring that anyone who had any information regarding the suspects set up meetings with law enforcement ” Vali said  “At the same time  we wanted to make sure the rights of all citizens were protected ”Part of the challenge in fostering cooperation with law enforcement lies in helping Muslims feel safe after years of distrust stoked by no fly lists  the New York Police Department’s mosque infiltration program  and the FBI’s shooting of Ibragim Todashev  a friend of Tamerlan Tsarnaev Over the last year  the Roxbury mosque has held two forums to help Muslims understand their civil rights  Vincent B  Lisi  the special agent in charge of the FBI’s Boston division  visited the mosque last month to introduce himself and answer questions Speaking to about 75 people gathered in the mosque’s café  Lisi exuded friendliness and spoke engagingly about his service for the agency in Yemen  But the questions anonymously submitted to the moderator on slips of paper — about racial profiling  entrapment  and mosque infiltration  among other topics — revealed deep anxieties among those gathered Laila Murad  a 23 year old Muslim student and civil rights activist who grew up in Framingham  said many local Muslims feel targeted  vulnerable “Until you prove otherwise  you are under suspicion ” she said  “It creates a lot of mistrust ” nThe first responders to the bombings included many Muslim doctors and other health professionals  Among them was Dr  Firas Naji  a hospitalist at the Cambridge Health Alliance  who was volunteering at Medical Tent B  a couple of blocks from the finish line Naji  who sees his vocation as an answer to Islam’s call to alleviate suffering  treated a few shrapnel wounds  but mostly took care of runners with hypothermia  low sodium levels  and foot problems  as well as severe emotional distress He was struck by how well the diverse medical team maintained its focus  even as they wondered whether another bomb might explode  “I was working with doctors of various faiths  doctors and nurses from all over the world ” he said  “They all represented Boston  all came together to help ”Shamaila Khan  a psychologist who is clinical director for the Disaster Behavioral Health Program at the Center for Multicultural Mental Health at Boston Medical Center  helped counsel families of the grievously injured One relative of an amputee sobbed as Khan comforted her and said  “These Islamists have to get out of this country ”Khan felt herself involuntarily loosen her grip on the woman’s hand  Consciously  she tightened it again  quickly setting the comment aside so she could continue taking care of the suffering woman That moment stayed with Khan in the days and weeks that followed  as she helped tend to Muslims affected by the tragedy  She is now working with a team of professionals on providing Muslims with better access to mental health care “Boston Strong  what does that mean ” Khan said in an interview  “Does it include us ”She also recalled a neighbor stopping her a few days after the bombings to ask  simply  “Are you OK ” A small gesture  but powerful in its way  nLast year  Jalon Fowler was running the race for the third time  on track to finish with her best time ever  when a police officer stopped her just after Heartbreak Hill  The race was over A couple of days later  she sent her husband to pick up her medal downtown  She did not want to deal with any sideways looks from strangers as she passed by in her headscarf Yet Fowler  who converted to Islam in 1999  felt none of the fear she felt after the 9 11 attacks  Her colleagues and training teammates at John Hancock  a primary sponsor of the Marathon  were as friendly and supportive as ever  She knew  within a couple of days  that she would run again this year Fowler never really stopped training  She joined the Run to Remember half marathon last May  Most mornings through the long  cold winter  she left the house before dawn to get to the gym  This year  she is raising money for the Revere Special Education Parent Advisory Council  an organization close to her heart because one of her three children is autistic “I definitely feel a passion to represent this year  for the victims  for their families  for the city  for my family  and for the communities that I’m part of ” she said The Boston Marathon was always part of Syed’s life growing up  Every year  his parents would take their seven children to spend Patriots Day with another Pakistani family that lived in Brookline  a block from the marathon route The youngsters would scramble between the house  where they watched the elite competitors on television  and Beacon Street  where they gave the runners high fives and cups of water  nBut Syed  26  who works at Oracle  never imagined running until last year  when he spent the weekend before the Marathon with two friends who were running  The night before the race  he signed up to run the Chicago marathon with one of them that next fall After the bombings  Syed knew he would somehow run Boston  too  The attacks felt like an assault on his childhood memories “It’s a part of the tradition of your city ” he said  “You look forward to it every single year  And you understand how jubilant an event it is  And that was taken away ”But what wasn’t taken away after the tragedy was his sense of belonging It was a hard won feeling  after years growing up in the shadow of 9 11  and then gaining a new self confidence as a student at Boston University  Studying abroad in Beirut and then visiting Pakistan made him realize  at last  He is an American  And Boston is home The day after the bombings  Syed put on a hoodie and went for his first training run along the Charles River  Along the path were messages scrawled in chalk   n“Not to be corny  but I kind of felt like there was a city behind me ” said Syed  whose run will benefit research for liver cancer  a disease that recently took his uncle’s life The bombings  he said  “were the actions of two individuals  and sure  they were part of a denomination  but the response to it was just human  pure and simple “We came together beyond any race  religion  creed  and we helped one another out ”', '2014_113')",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

have made the same decision and would have made the same choice of family over civic duty ” Singleton’s attorney  E  Peter Parker  said Tuesday after a brief hearing in Suffolk Superior Court  Singleton was excused from appearing in court Parker disclosed on Monday that Singleton wants to plead guilty to charges of criminal contempt in both counties  In a motion filed in Bristol County Superior Court  Parker wrote that when she refused to testify  Singleton was motivated by her “love for and extremely close relationship” with Hernandez  24  and his codefendant Ernest Wallace She had previously pleaded not guilty  Parker declined to comment on why Singleton wants to change her plea  nSuffolk County prosecutors say that Singleton refused to disclose what she knows about Hernandez’s alleged role in the killing of two Dorchester men  Daniel Abreu  28  and Safiro Furtado  29  on July 16  2012 Authorities say Hernandez shot the men while driving a 2006 Toyota 4Runner loaned to him by a Rhode Island car dealer  Last June  officers tracked the silver sport utility vehicle to Singleton’s home in Bristol  Conn   where it was parked in a garage and covered with cobwebs  officials said In Bristol County  Singleton is accused of refusing to testify before a grand jury investigating the death of Odin L  Lloyd  27  whose bullet riddled body was found in an industrial park near Hernandez’s North Attleborough home last June Prosecutors say they granted Singleton immunity to testify before both grand juries  When she refused to cooperate  Singleton was found to be in civil contempt and jailed for six months  Parker said Hernandez has pleaded not guilty to murder charges in the deaths of Lloyd  Abreu  and Furtado  He is being held without bail In the motion filed this week  Parker said that Singleton feared she would have been charged with perjury if she testified truthfully before the grand juries  because prosecutors might not believe her story  Parker cited the case of Hernandez’s fiancee  Shayanna Jenkins  who is accused of lying to a grand jury investigating Lloyd’s death  She pleaded not guilty to perjury Singleton was  nactive in Hernandez’s upbringing and “loves him like she loves her own two sons ” Parker said  He wrote in his motion that she was so close to Wallace “that she considered him a part of her family ”Wallace and another Hernandez associate  Carlos Ortiz  have been charged with murder in Lloyd’s killing and have pleaded not guilty “These are people that she cares for and loves very much ” said Parker  referring to Hernandez and Wallace  “You get subpoenaed to go into the grand jury to provide information about someone you love  it’s a very difficult and emotional thing to do ”Parker hopes to consolidate the criminal contempt cases against Singleton  but Suffolk County prosecutors oppose that request  said Assistant District Attorney Patrick M  Haggan Singleton wants the cases to be combined because of her health  Parker said  Singleton had been in remission for breast cancer  but now the disease is back and there are concerns that it may be spreading  Parker said A hearing has been set for July 29 in Suffolk Superior Court to decide whether the two cases will be combined  Officials have also scheduled a hearing on Aug  12 for Singleton to change her plea in Bristol County Parker expects prosecutors in both counties to seek prison time for Singleton “I’m going to work with every fiber of my being to keep her out of jail  She’s done six months  I think that’s enough ” Parker said Singleton also faces a conspiracy charge in Bristol County and has pleaded not guilty Prosecutors allege that Singleton helped Hernandez’s “right hand man ” Wallace  travel to Florida after Lloyd was killed  They also say she discussed helping Ortiz flee to Puerto Rico and got rid of a cellphone that Wallace had used Parker said Singleton does not intend to change her plea in that case “It’s kind of a novel legal

Technical Vocational High School prepares to welcome one of its smallest freshman classes in decades amid fears that it could eventually close or cut back sharply on its programs Fewer than 150 ninth graders are expected to report to the Roxbury school next week  a drop of about 60 percent from two years ago  when 375 freshmen enrolled  t nThe enrollment plunge comes as the school also has been scrambling this month to fill about 60 teacher positions and other vacancies  including dean of discipline and director of special education posts Madison Park’s falling star stands in sharp contrast to other vocational schools across the state  many of which have lengthy waiting lists  Interim Superintendent John McDonough said in an interview  nFriday that the enrollment drop highlights the “urgency of making dramatic changes” to the school  one of the lowest performing in the state  He delivered a similar message to the staff in a letter earlier this month  n“Students and their parents are telling us something important  Madison Park  as it exists today  is not a place where most students feel they will succeed ” McDonough wrote in the letter  “This is a message we must listen to quite carefully ” In June  an intervention team appointed jointly by McDonough and the Boston Teachers Union closing the school in three years if it fails to improve  and replacing it with a vocational school that would operate independently of the School Department McDonough has said he prefers making the necessary changes to turn around Madison Park  rather than taking more radical steps such as shutting it down  He also rejected a recommendation to oust the school’s headmaster but agreed with replacing other administrators Madison Park took steps last week toward filling its teaching and staffing vacancies  extending about 30 offers  McDonough said he felt confident that a hiring committee put in place at Madison Park in recent weeks could get the job done “We are in very good shape ” McDonough said  “The hiring team put in place is an incredible group that is clearly focused on their task ”But some teachers questioned how the school year will be able to start smoothly on Sept  4 with so many last minute hires  The teachers said they are not surprised fewer students are enrolling “We don’t do a good job of getting the word out  but we need to have a quality product to offer ” said one teacher who asked not to be named because he was not authorized to speak to the news media  “We have to rebuild the store ”Some of the enrollment decline was planned  The School Department for years had been removing students who have no interest in vocational education but were sent to the school to fill empty seats  Many teachers suspected this practice contributed to the school’s low performance because students who didn’t want to be there often caused discipline problems For this fall  the School Department decided to admit only students who have expressed interest in vocational education But the change in admission policy only partially explains the drop  said officials  teachers  and other supporters  Madison Park is suffering an image problem with all the difficulties administrators have had in turning it around  diminishing its appeal to students  nFor instance  in the school system’s annual school choice lottery  the number of incoming ninth graders selecting Madison Park as one of their top three choices has fallen sharply  For this coming fall  only 121 applicants ranked Madison Park as a top choice in the first round of the lottery  down from 332 the previous year  according to the School Department Complicating the problem further is that the school system has done a poor job of marketing Madison Park and explaining the benefits of a career in the trades to students  the school’s teachers and supporters said  Madison Park offers classes in a range of trades  including digital design  cosmetology  plumbing  telecommunications  carpentry  and construction  according to its website  “No one has sold the school ” said Richard Stutman  president of the Boston Teachers Union  “I do think there is an underlying sentiment among a lot of people that entering a trade or vocation is not good enough  That is contrary to common sense  There are a lot of ways to make these trades attractive ”Elton Bocage  a parent who is cochairwoman of the Madison Park school site council  said he was not surprised that fewer students enrolled “If you read in the newspaper that this school is not doing well or that school is not doing well  you’re not going to want to send your daughter or son there ” he said But Bocage  who has a son and daughter at Madison Park  added there is a lot of value in teaching students a trade  He said he is eager to see the school turn around “As a parent  I’m excited to see they are trying to do the right thing  but why did they wait so long to hire ” he said  “They are not going to get the best teachers  but they will get good teachers ”McDonough  as well as many other Madison Park teachers and supporters  sees a silver lining in having a smaller but more enthusiastic freshman class this year — an opportunity to help rebuild a school with motivated students who want to succeed and who could entice more students to enroll in the future “I think there are a lot more students who would like to have a vocational technical education ” McDonough said  adding  “We have considerable work to do ”', '2014_388')",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

handling the street protests against police brutality and racism  which helped avoid the disturbances seen in other cities in the wake of the Ferguson  Mo   grand jury decision   nA day after throngs of people took to the streets of Boston  police officials said they made a concerted decision against an aggressive show of force  worried it would stoke anger  Police did not wear riot gear  for example  and held many officers in reserve  Many officers tracked the march on bicycle  a symbol of community policing   t nBoston police Commissioner William Evans said he wanted to maintain public safety while allowing people to “express their frustration ” A measured approach is often more effective  he said  because it shows officers to be “more human ” “It’s about establishing respect and setting expectations and making sure people understand that ” he said  “Sometimes helmets and sticks can get in the way of that ” Evans went out of his way to thank the protesters for maintaining relative calm  The rally was also  with an estimated 1 400 people  small compared to protests in other cities — or the street disturbances that followed championship victories by Boston sports teams

charges converted to civil infractions in court Wednesday  authorities said Some protesters said police overreacted to what was a peaceful protest  and in some cases used excessive force  Tripp Diaz

treated for neck and head injuries at Tufts Medical Center “The police were very excessive ” Oliver said  “I was taken to the ground by five police officers and just thrown around like a rag doll ”Oliver said she was arrested after she fell to the ground when protesters tried to get onto the Massachusetts Turnpike near South Station  Oliver said she and other injured protesters are considering taking legal action against police State Police spokesman David Procopio declined to address the individual allegations but said troopers used “exemplary restraint in a very chaotic situation  holding a line against a surge of more than a thousand people who were trying to trespass onto major highways ”Officials said that while officers were subjected to taunts and in some cases pushed to the ground  the march was generally peaceful  A police spokesman declined to comment on specific complaints about  ninjuries  Evans praised officers for their restraint in the face of goading from demonstrators  preventing the situation from escalating   “We were engaged with the crowd  and as much as they tried to take us to the next level  we were disciplined ” Evans said  State Police said they did not activate specialized crowd and riot control units  opting to keep them on standby given the peaceful nature of the protest “We allowed the patrol units already in place to handle the crowd control ” Procopio said  “We showed all possible restraint ” Tactical units were ready to respond in a matter of minutes if the protest had become more unruly  he said  “We made a conscious decision that we would not use them if they were not absolutely needed ” he said  Police officials said a primary goal was to prevent protesters from reaching highways  as had occurred in other protests across the country  Evans said he worried that large crowds on the highway could potentially cause a panic  “We made the decision to hold the line ” he said  Boston has become known in law enforcement circles for its measured approach to mass demonstrations  a strategy honed through numerous championship celebrations and the Occupy movement in 2011  “You have a police commissioner who had first hand experience in dealing with the Occupy movement  and this is one of the lessons ” said Chuck Wexler  executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum  a Washington  D C   research organization  “I think that carries over ” Police officials are increasingly recognizing that outfitting police in riot gear and bringing in  military vehicles in an effort to control crowds can backfire “The unintended consequence is that the crowd thinks you expect violence ” he said  “It’s a self fulfilling prophecy ” Specialists said Boston police have adopted a more conciliatory approach to crowd control through painful experience  In 2008  a 22 year old college student stopped breathing and later died after a confrontation with police during a Boston Celtics championship celebration  In 2004  a 21 year old man was killed by a drunk driver during rioting after the Super Bowl  and a college student was killed when police fired pepper pellets into a crowd celebrating a Red Sox victory  “Boston police definitely learned lessons from those unfortunate tragedies ” said Tom Nolan  associate professor of criminology at Merrimack College  “The sentiment at the time was might makes right ” The approach Tuesday  Nolan said  stood in sharp contrast to the militarized approach seen in Ferguson  “What that serves to do is exacerbate the situation ” he said  “It just fans

Dorchester YMCA  where he is the sports coordinator The 30 year old Angus was in Atlanta when he received a call from his 19 year old mentee  David Lovett  a former Dorchester High basketball player who was encouraged by Angus to avoid negative influences by replacing his hoop dreams with book dreams  Lovett  now a freshman at Bunker Hill Community College  was asked to speak at the YMCA of Greater Boston’s Dream Big Party in October  He talked about not only Angus’s guidance but how he has served as a mentor himself to kids whose sole goal is to become the next LeBron James or Rajon Rondo  There is no Plan B Lovett didn’t have Plan B either  until he met Angus  That experience led to his moving speech at the gala  At a charity auction moments after the speech  a couple bid successfully on a $1 000 Celtics ticket package to the April 16 season finale against the Washington Wizards that included premium seats  dinner at the Courtside Club  and parking passes  The couple  Jack and Eileen Connors  presented the package to Lovett And his first choice was to invite Angus Angus said he saw himself in Lovett  an affable kid who perhaps put too much emphasis on basketball during high school  When the scholarship offers didn’t pour in  when he wasn’t one of ESPN’s top 100 recruits  he had no other options  A college education was a fleeting consideration  the most viable option was hanging with friends and trying to figure out his future on the fly  n“There’s a certain type of uniqueness about him ” Angus said of Lovett  “He’s always polite  More importantly  he’s from the community  I saw a lot of kids who used to look up to him because of the way he carries himself  There were little chime ins where I can say ‘do this’ or ‘do that’ and keep him focused on a certain task “You meet teens that are wonderful  You meet some that are very hard to deal with but you know they’ve got to cross that hump and you’ve got to be patient with them ”The two played hoops at the YMCA and Angus took an interest in Lovett’s path  He asked him whether college was an option  It wasn’t  He asked if Lovett had thought about life after basketball  He hadn’t  He asked Lovett if he had any idea of how to prepare for adulthood  He didn’t Lovett’s a soft spoken kid with a bright smile  He loves basketball but wasn’t really sure what else he loved “Not even sure ” Lovett said when asked about his future before he met Angus  “College was not much of an option but I looked at it  My main focus was what I was going to do after basketball season “ Angus  gave me a lot of information  He is a guy who kept asking questions and as time progressed I realized he was the guy who always had answers  He was feeding me all this knowledge ”Bunker Hill was Lovett’s choice and he has warmed to the college environment  He said he is more confident in his ability to flourish academically  not just athletically  Most of Lovett’s growth occurred in his long term goals  He is no longer limited by his neighborhood or environment  There is more to life than what he has seen While many of us are blessed enough to watch the game from so close up we can see the beads of sweat on Garnett’s head  others view life from Section 305  uncertain if there will be an opportunity to upgrade  uncertain if life will offer them a different option than what they have already experienced “At this age  I’m old enough to know the differences between right and wrong  As I have matured  I realize that this is real  this is it ” said Lovett  who said he received two A’s among his most recent grades  “You’re done with high school and all you want to do is just sit around  that’s not the best idea  I’m happy where I’m at ”Angus’s mentoring has rubbed off on Lovett  who works with younger YMCA patrons at the center’s Brunch and Basketball Program sponsored by Omega Psi Phi fraternity  While Lovett is running ball with some of those eighth  and ninth graders  they approach him with some of the same life questions he asked Angus “I don’t want children to know what I did in high school  sometimes being a fool in class ” Lovett said  “It’s a  positive  image I know I have to keep  I have to stay positive  I have to be the mature one  the older one ”April 16 was a special night for the duo  Neither had ever watched a Celtics game from such a premium proximity  Said Angus  “You dream of watching a game that close  You said whoever is down there got money  We always think you have to be some type of important person to be down courtside or a rap star ”On that night  there was plenty of space for an impactful mentor and his mentee', '2014_1092')",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"('They don’t offer basic moviemaking courses like cinematography or editing  Professors don’t help students perfect their elevatorpitches to studio bigs  The word “film” isn’t even part of the program’s title  And yet  when the Academy Awards ceremony takes place Sunday  the Department of Visual and Environmental Studies at Harvard University will get the kind of close up that is sure to raise its profile  Three films by former VES classmates — Joshua Oppenheimer  Jehane Noujaim  and Richard Rowley — are among the five nominated for an Oscar for best documentary feature  nIt’s an unprecedented triumph for a small program that takes an unorthodox approach to the world of film  Instead of focusing on the practical skills needed to start a Hollywood career  the department’s theorists  experimental filmmakers  and documentarians aim to train students how to think about the world outside the editing bay  and to translate those insights into the syntax of film The VES program is considered “the gold standard in the US for nonfiction filmmaking ” said Cara Mertes  director of JustFilms  a Ford Foundation initiative  Mertes helped provide grants for each of the Oscar nominated documentaries by Harvard trained filmmakers  in her previous post as director of the Sundance Institute’s Documentary Film Program   n“It’s not a typical film program ” she said of the VES department  “They’re saying cinema is one form of understanding the world visually  one anchored by an understanding of visual culture ”Alfred Guzzetti  a filmmaker and VES professor  describes that philosophy in straightforward terms  n“If you want professional training  do it after college ” said Guzzetti  “In college  try to learn about the world ”That’s exactly the approach taken by the three Oscar nominees  who were all undergraduate VES students in the mid  to late 1990s  They went on to spend years on their films  immersing themselves in the cultures they were documenting  compiling mounds of footage  Jehane Noujaim’s “The Square” captures the Egyptian uprisings that began in 2011 in Cairo’s Tahrir Square  Noujaim takes viewers inside the lives of demonstrators calling for democracy in Egypt  documenting everything from flashes of bloody violence to moments of breathtaking idealism Noujaim  now 39  arrived at Harvard in 1992 intending to study medicine  She abandoned that plan as she fell in love with photography  She had spent much of her teens exploring her own complicated cultural and family dynamic  her father was born in Egypt  her mother in Connecticut  Before long  she was drawn to filmmaking  working with fellow VES students on a documentary called “Blue Hill Avenue” that chronicled gang life in Roxbury Richard Rowley  39  is nominated for “Dirty Wars ” a film that questions the actions of the US military in the Middle East  He tells the story through the eyes of investigative reporter Jeremy Scahill  including interviews with government officials and horrific images of locals killed in the crossfire  Instead of embedding themselves with the US military  Rowley and Scahill drove around Afghanistan in a beat up Toyota  always making sure to get back to Kabul before the sun went down  After dark  the Taliban took over the roads A Michigan native  Rowley is the son of an auto mechanic turned high school teacher  Before starting college in 1995  Rowley and friends spent a year abroad  rambling through Central America in a van  working on a farm and becoming immersed in the Zapatista protests in Mexico  At Harvard  he met Oppenheimer  a political activist who would become well known on campus for his gay activism  at one point dressing in drag to stage an in class protest of government professor and noted conservative Harvey Mansfield  Oppenheimer’s Oscar nominated film  “The Act of Killing ” revisits the massacre of hundreds of thousands of alleged communists  ethnic Chinese  and others nearly 40 years ago  In the documentary  the aging leaders of the country’s death squads not only speak candidly about their killings but also reenact them in jaw dropping fashion  complete with sets and costumes of their choice  inspired by film styles ranging from musicals to film noir  Oppenheimer’s former VES classmate Christine Cynn is credited as a codirector All three directors had to scramble for every penny in their budgets It took Oppenheimer  for example  nearly eight years to complete “Killing ” which he funded himself until a series of grants and public money from European agencies filled out the film’s nearly $1 million budget  Noujaim’s desire to continue filming the turmoil in Egypt well after her originally planned wrap date led her to raise money through Kickstarter  Her successful $126 020 campaign finished last March  nThe list of decorated VES graduates is considerable  including Damien Chazelle  whose movie “Whiplash” won top prizes for dramatic film at the Sundance Film Festival in January  and Maxim Pozdorovkin  who codirected the 2013 documentary “Pussy Riot  A Punk Prayer ” about the Russian protest band  which was short listed for a documentary Oscar  nEven among the talented ranks of VES students  the group that included Noujiam  Rowley  and Oppenheimer stood out  Guzzetti said  “That generation was extraordinary  and we knew that when they were coming through ” Guzzetti recalled  “Just to have a substantial group of very talented students present at the same time — their energy fed one another and created a time of excitement ”“Josh is wildly imaginative and unmoored by convention ” said Robb Moss  the department’s chairman and a mentor to all three nominees  “Of the three  Rick is probably the most activist  He started with a strong bedrock of sensibility  Jehane has this quality         that people open up to  She’s very curious about the world and has this incredible nose for what kinds of subjects in this world are her subjects ” The VES program  which emerged in the late 1960s  includes such subjects as visual arts  design  and the natural and built environment  The department benefits not only from its faculty  which includes acclaimed filmmaker Ross McElwee  but from Cambridge’s rich documentary culture  The LEF Foundation  which provides support for films  is based in Cambridge  So are Frederick Wiseman  considered by many to be the greatest documentarian of all time  and Oscar winner Errol Morris  “The Fog of War ” “The Thin Blue Line”   a friend of Guzzetti who regularly plays chamber music with him  n“I can tell you one of the first things that I do when I’m working on a film  I show them to Robb Moss’s class  to Alfred’s class  to Ross McElwee’s class  and sometimes to their combined classes ” said Morris  an executive producer for Oppenheimer’s film  “It’s been a great resource ”The students were also influenced by Dušan Makavejev  “WR  Mysteries of the Organism”   the acclaimed Serbian filmmaker who was a visiting VES professor  “The program encouraged us to be mavericks ” explained Oppenheimer  39  “They didn’t spend any time  if I recall  about the business side   Guzzetti  taught me real patience and steadfastness   Moss  was incredibly practical  I remember one simple piece of advice  but it was useful again and again  ‘Let your best material speak in the best possible way ’ And then Dušan Makavejev is the person who inspired my wildness  He inspired us to sleep with cameras under our pillows so we could wake up and record our nightmares ” While larger film programs like those at Boston University and Emerson College offer students direct access to the mainstream entertainment industry in Hollywood and New York  that’s not what all student filmmakers — especially those thinking about making documentaries — are looking for  said Charles Merzbacher  associate film professor at Boston University “Documentaries  more than dramatic filmmaking  require you to live by your wits ” he said  “Instead of using your social skills to enchant producers who will help finance your projects and schmoozing your way to the right contact to pull together the right crew to collaborate with  documentaries are much more about the individual effort and going out there and coming up with a strong idea and sticking with it ”While at Harvard  Rowley and Oppenheimer lived with about 30 other students at a Dudley Co Operative Society house off campus  sharing group meals and debating how they might inspire political change through art   nNoujaim didn’t know Rowley and Oppenheimer well when they were students  but she says they shared something at Harvard that links them   “The practicality of actually making films  I don’t know if those classes exist at Harvard ” she said  “I certainly didn’t take any of them

School in November 1966 were the grandest ever pitched for a Boston public school  startling city councilors during a presentation that made front page news the next day The campus style high school in Roxbury — a neighborhood where educational opportunities had long been short changed — would boast an Olympic sized swimming pool  a television studio  and possibly a nightclub or coffeehouse for teenagers  There would be seven buildings total  including a venue inspired by the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts in New York City and a vocational education center geared for students and adults alike   t n“This high school will be the salvation of the Boston school system ” city development director Edward J  Logue boldly predicted  “It will give Latin School a run for its money ” nThose lofty aspirations would never come to be Instead of delivering salvation to a school system battling racial inequality  Madison Park repeatedly emerged over the ensuing decades as a symbol of educational failure  bureaucratic neglect  and lingering racial tensions Even the opening of the complex in 1977 — years behind schedule — brought mounting disappointment  Construction problems forced students to eat cold meals for six weeks  The swimming pool was unusable  A city fiscal crisis threatened plans to build the vocational center  The growing list of problems was “like a cancer eating at the school ” the head of the parent council told the Boston Herald in 1978  nThe troubled history of Madison Park offers insight into why Boston has failed generations of its students who desire to learn a trade or technical skills — often to boost themselves out of a life of poverty — and why local employers have to tap out of state workers for jobs that otherwise could have gone to residents a few blocks away It also raises questions  as Boston faces another urgent crisis to turn around Madison Park  about what it will take for the city to develop a top notch vocational high school  like those that thrive in almost every corner of the state  or whether it is doomed to repeat the failures of its past “Madison Park has tremendous potential if we could ever get it together ” said Michael Contompasis  a former Boston school superintendent  noting that Worcester has transformed its vocational school into a national model  “It’s a question of leadership  it’s a question of political will  and it’s a question of rethinking all the recommendations ever made ”Some educators and education advocates in the city question whether the problems facing Madison Park are surmountable   nand believe Boston should consider starting  na new vocational school from scratch  The decades of disappointment  they say  have bred a deeply rooted culture of distrust and entrenched territorialism within the school and the neighborhood around it Overhaul efforts through the years have often stalled or failed as teachers  community activists  and political leaders have clashed over philosophical differences in how to push the school forward  and debates over whether motives were fueled by the interest of students or personal or political agendas Looming over these fights is a School Department that state and city leaders have criticized for valuing college preparatory programs over vocational education and for lacking a basic understanding of what it takes to train students for technical careers or the trades  That has led to ill fated decisions  such as appointing headmasters without the appropriate expertise  and filling seats at Madison Park with students who have failing grades  disciplinary problems  and no interest in vocational education  nYet every time state or city officials propose spinning off Madison Park from the city school system  allowing it to operate as an independent school system like nearly every other vocational school across the state  the School Department balks  Some teachers get nervous they will lose their jobs or protection under the Boston Teachers Union contract  and community activists protest  fearing such a move could prevent fewer Roxbury students from enrolling Just this summer  an intervention team  appointed by Interim Superintendent John McDonough and the Boston Teachers Union to craft a set of remedies for Madison Park  recommended closing the school in three years and replacing it with a regional vocational school at another site if a turnaround fails  McDonough rejected the idea “It is my belief and intent to focus on success rather than planning for failure ” McDonough said  But he acknowledged the challenges are immense  including developing a new culture and mindset at the school “I think you have a lot of frustration among faculty and particularly the students who say that we keep promising stuff and not delivering ” McDonough said in an interview  vowing the School Department would do better  “We have an opportunity now to deliver  It does require changes  but it can be done ”  nAs school opened this fall  the situation at Madison Park could not have been more bleak  The school scrambled to hire nearly 60 teachers and administrators in August  and some positions remain unfilled  Many students and teachers went about a week without a legitimate class schedule  prompting students to demonstrate Headmaster Diane Ross Gary  who took the reins just a year earlier  resigned a few days later  as a growing number of teachers  students  and parents called for her termination  The School Department had resisted firing her for months  and several black political leaders and community activists had lobbied Mayor Martin J  Walsh to keep her in the post  saying she deserved more time to prove herself In the end  Gary  who had no prior experience as a headmaster  had failed to gain state certification to lead a school in Massachusetts All of this occurred as Madison Park was supposed to be starting the third year of a turnaround effort that was pushed by then mayor Thomas M  Menino  who promised in his 2012 State of the City address to transform the school into a critical job training center for students and adults alike Each year of the turnaround has been marked by notable missteps  Scores on the Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System exams this spring dropped in each subject area  In science  for instance  just 3 percent of 10th graders scored proficient  down from 25 percent who scored proficient or advanced the previous year  The school’s graduation rate of 63 6 percent  while largely improving  still remains more than 20 percentage points below the state average  “We have kids here who can’t read ” said one teacher who was not authorized to speak to the news media  “We have a huge problem with kids who can’t do fractions  To me that’s a real crisis ”The poor academic achievement  combined with student behavior problems  severely restricts the school’s ability to place students in apprenticeship programs  a key path to employment Vocational education experts also say Madison Park is not establishing enough placements in small private businesses  which are more apt to hire students after graduation than large corporations or government agencies  The dismal record has Mitchell Chester  the state commissioner of elementary and secondary education  contemplating whether he should formally declare the school “underperforming ” a move that could set the stage for state receivership in three years absent a dramatic turnaround  A decision is expected in the coming weeks  nBoston’s early problems with vocational education were rooted in racial inequities that prompted federal court intervention  White students typically attended high schools with more modern facilities than those used by black and Latino students at the crumbling Boston Trade High School in Mission Hill  nUS District Judge W  Arthur Garrity Jr  embraced the Madison Park project  calling it the “keystone” of his plans in the 1970s to desegregate the public schools  A team of experts traveled across the country to develop the programming for what would be called the Humphrey Occupational Resource Center  which opened in 1980 at the Madison Park complex  Initially  the Humphrey Center taught students for a half day from all the high schools across the city who wanted to learn a trade  and it operated separately from Madison Park High School  which at the time had a strong focus on music  States across the nation had successfully used half day programs  but in Boston the arrangement would be short lived  Confronted with declining enrollment at both the Humphrey Center and Madison Park  the School Committee voted in 1986 to merge the two amid budget cutting  It also decided to give away a chunk of the complex  including the science building and later the music center  to a new exam school  now called the O’Bryant School of Math and Science The merger did not go well  Within a few years  state education officials placed several vocational programs on probation “It was a travesty of epic proportions ” said Judith Baker  who taught English at Madison Park from 1979 to 2005 and is now a member of the Friends of Madison Park  “The parents were right to be angry  Madison Park began to deteriorate as a technical school  The superintendent of schools didn’t believe in vocational education at all  We didn’t have any defenders ” nTo this day  the repercussions of the merger resonate  contributing to an identity crisis that has lasted to this day over whether Madison Park is truly a citywide vocational high school or a neighborhood high school for Roxbury that happens to have vocational programs as electives  said Charles Lyons  the superintendent director of Shawsheen Valley Technical High School in Billerica and a member of the Madison Park intervention team He said the key to Madison Park’s future success is to sever it from the school system and have an independent board of experts run it “The kids are worthy of a high quality first class technical education ” Lyons said  “Boston has the financial capability to provide it  The adults have to make it happen ”State education officials first raised the idea of independent oversight in the late 1980s  believing it was the only way to ensure Madison Park would get the appropriate attention  But the School Department resisted Then mayor Raymond Flynn  concerned that Boston was failing to prepare enough students for jobs on the Big Dig and other major projects  called for Madison Park to become an independent vocational school in his 1992 State of the City address  But the proposal sparked bitter protests from students  community activists  and disaffected faculty  who repeatedly spread false rumors that Flynn wanted to give away seats to suburbanites  n nA year later  students descended on City Hall to protest  Menino  who was preparing to become acting mayor because Flynn was departing to become ambassador to the Vatican  met with a few of the students  After they emerged from the meeting  other protesters pelted Menino with snowballs  even though he remained undecided about the proposal The issue ultimately proved too toxic during a mayoral election year and it died Madison Park slipped from the headlines  and with a skilled headmaster at the helm for a few years  the school enjoyed an academic reemergence  But that  too  would be short lived  undermined by a succession of headmasters and then a laser like focus on improving MCAS scores  sacrificing time in vocational education classes for test prep Menino would not enter the fray of turning around Madison Park again until his 2012 speech  setting off a new round of acrimony On the morning students protested last month — demanding their class schedules immediately — a handful of carpentry students  who had already been assigned some courses  were on the other side of Roxbury  pouring cement for the foundation of a single family house they are helping to build Madison Park teachers  administrators and supporters point to the activity on the job site that morning as evidence that good things are happening there  “The staff has worked very hard to make sure the school is moving forward and are trying to make sure the education is current and relevant and prepares them for the future ” said Al Holland  the school’s acting headmaster  nOn a tour of the 900 student school one recent morning  the chaos of last month appeared to have subsided  Nicely painted hallways were quiet  Freshmen in one math

216,,,,,,,,,"('A $1 000 charitable donation that costs the donor $500  State officials say that math is correct This year  for the first time  Massachusetts is  designed to encourage a specific type of charitable giving  and nonprofit officials are pushing to get the word out before the current tax year ends Dec  31  t nBut the details are complicated enough that  with just a week left before the 2014 deadline  about a third of the credits have yet to be claimed The Community Investment Tax Credit  part of an economic development law signed by Governor Deval Patrick in 2012  took effect this year  It offers a 50 percent credit to anyone who donates money to a community development corporation  or CDC  That adds another layer of complexity  since many people are not familiar with CDCs  They are nonprofits that try to improve low  and moderate income neighborhoods by  for example  providing job training and supporting local businesses  Here’s how the program works  Qualifying CDCs are given allotments of tax credits  which they use to try to entice donors  For a minimum donation of $1 000  donors receive a tax credit equivalent to half their contribution  so a $5 000 gift to the organization would result in a $2 500 credit on their tax return It’s a public private sector collaboration in which government money is used to attract private dollars for nonprofits  and state revenue is expended only if the credits are claimed Sweetening the deal  donors can take a federal income tax deduction on their donation  based on their tax bracket “There’s definitely a learning curve for both the nonprofits and the donors ” said Joseph Kriesberg  president of the Massachusetts Association of Community Development Corporations  which proposed the program and received legislative support from state Senator Sal DiDomenico and then state Representative Linda Dorcena Forry  who is now in the Senate  “But as this thing has rolled forward  we have  I think  gotten better at explaining it  and as it sinks in  people are understanding it more ”Of the more than 50 CDCs in Massachusetts   in this year’s program  The number of tax credits allocated by the state for 2014 totals $3 million — individual CDCs received allocations ranging from $60 000 to $150 000 — and so far about $2 million of those credits have been claimed  The deadline for making donations in return for a 2014 tax credit is Dec  31 “Early on  as we explained this to prospective donors  there was a little bit of a too good to be true skepticism  but that has started to turn around in the last few months ” Kriesberg said  “For a new program as unusual as this  I feel like we’ve had a pretty good start ”Patrick has described the program as “a way of strengthening organizations that make possible the kind of lifting up of neighborhoods and of communities that we need done  and it can never be done through government alone         and CDCs are enormously important in that respect ”And Governor elect Charlie Baker has said the program is a “great idea” that “makes a ton of sense” and “we should be all over it as a Commonwealth ”The CDCs can use the donations in a variety of ways to spur economic development  A CDC on Cape Cod  for example  is trying to shore up the fishing industry  while a CDC in Franklin County is operating a food processing center designed to help farmers  caterers  and restaurants  CDCs in Dorchester and Fitchburg are rebuilding housing markets hard hit by the foreclosure crisis The program is “very important  especially for us  because we’re a small CDC ” said Nam Pham  executive director of Viet Aid  which works with the Vietnamese population of Dorchester’s Fields Corner neighborhood to develop affordable housing and offer home buyer education programs  among other projects  “We always have a shortage of support  of funding  and this tax credit has helped us raise more money from new sources that never gave to us before ”Because CDCs have an incentive to aggressively seek donors to try to make use of all their tax credits  “what I’m hearing from members anecdotally is that this has motivated them to establish new relationships  with potential donors   and it’s getting their board members more involved in fund raising ” added Kriesberg Next year  the amount of tax credits available jumps to $6 million  and the program is slated to expire in 2019  A CDC can receive between $50 000 and $150 00 in tax credits per year for up to three years  To review the math  A CDC must raise $300 000 in contributions to take full advantage of $150 000 in tax credits “This is an interesting model around how to encourage more philanthropy and get the public sector and private sector in sync in terms of funneling their investments toward highly important organizations ” Kriesberg said  “There’s a lot of talk now about everybody leveraging everybody else  and how to drive resources to high performing organizations  and this  I think  is an innovative effort to do that ”', '2014_1276')",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"('Flanked by aides and her husband  the candidate positioned herself at the

children  according to a report and survey set for release Monday by the Massachusetts Business Alliance for Education  Bolstering the state’s public school systems is viewed as a critical step in producing more workers with the right skills to succeed in a more technologically driven economy  according to  “The New Opportunity to Lead  A Vision for Education in Massachusetts in the Next 20 Years ”  nMonday’s release of  will mark the beginning of a campaign to persuade state leaders to embrace the advocacy group’s proposals  from more charter schools to fundamental changes in teachers contracts The survey  part of which is included in the 120 page report  found that 69 percent of the 334 employers who responded said they experienced difficulty hiring employees with the appropriate skills  while 84 percent said school systems require moderate to major changes  The survey was conducted by MassINC Polling Group  n “You read and hear stories about how Massachusetts is the best in the nation  but we have a dismaying situation that not only do we have young people unemployed but a lot of jobs that are unfilled — good jobs  high tech jobs ” said Henry Dinger  chairman of the business alliance’s board of directors and a partner at Goodwin Procter LLC  “There are a bunch of other countries that are doing better and other countries are gaining on us fast ”Because Massachusetts has such a technologically advanced economy that is rapidly changing  school systems are struggling to keep pace in producing graduates prepared for this kind of job market  said one of the report’s author  Sir Michael Barber  a former high ranking British official who works with Pearson Barber said Massachusetts needs to move from a period of “adequacy ” the result of trying to ensure a level playing field for all school districts   to one that “unleashes greatness ”“You can’t order someone to be great  but you can create the conditions for being great ” said Barber  who prepared the report with Brightlines  a group of education experts   The report offers many recommendations to achieve greatness  including some already under consideration in Massachusetts  such as opening more charter schools  offering universal pre kindergarten  and providing individual schools in a district more flexibility to hire their staffs  extend the school day and make other changes Other recommendations are more radical  such as devising a statewide contract for all teachers  Currently  unions negotiate contracts with their respective school systems Business leaders may have a tough time selling their agenda to school leaders  teachers  and parents who resent corporate interests influencing the direction of public education  They fear schools will evolve into factories focused solely on producing workers and the joy of learning will be lost — a situation they say is already unfolding at many schools trying to boost test scores to avoid government sanctions The business alliance plans to unveil the report Monday morning at Microsoft Innovation   Policy Center in Cambridge  then  npresent it later that day to the Massachusetts Board of Elementary and Secondary Education in Malden  But organizers were frantically reprinting the report on Sunday after the Globe  which had been given an advance copy  spotted a section drawn largely verbatim from a Globe story in December on the Trotter Elementary School in Dorchester  The “case study” on the school was not attributed to the Globe  even though more than half of the writing came directly from the newspaper  The report’s authors  advised of the lapse  revised the section with appropriate attribution  “It is an isolated oversight ” said Barber as he apologized  “Everything else has been meticulously done in other parts of the report ” The report examines the state’s more than two decade overhaul of its schools — an effort that has catapulted Massachusetts from the middle of the pack nationally to the top  The report notes Massachusetts consistently ranks first on national standardized tests  earns high marks on international tests  and continues to make big gains in 10th grade scores on the Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System exams But one section raised questions about whether Massachusetts was reaching a plateau  offering up as potential evidence a drop in fourth grade reading scores on the 2013 NAEP tests  and that other educational systems  such as Hong Kong and Singapore  are vastly outperforming the state on international tests “We should be alarmed our rate of change is not high ” said Chris Gabrieli  chairman of the  and also served on an advisory committee that oversaw the report’s development  “Very successful organizations don’t sit on their laurels  They think a lot about how to get better faster  That is not a strength right now in Massachusetts ”The report endorsed one direction Massachusetts is already going in  Joining other states in adopting a common set of academic standards in English and math and developing a new online testing system that could replace the MCAS  Pearson has been assisting in that effort Yet in one of the more startling findings in the survey of employers — often perceived as enthusiastic supporters of standardized testing — respondents expressed concern that the state’s schools were overemphasizing standardized testing  potentially to the detriment of teaching skills critical for success in the workforce  such as the ability to think critically  communicate  and collaborate  Mitchell Chester  the state commissioner of elementary and secondary education  disagreed that Massachusetts was stagnating  For instance  he noted that Massachusetts eighth graders had the fastest rate of improvement on the TIMSS  an international math and science exam  which the report also cited “I do think the bigger point  while Massachusetts has a lot to be proud of and is the top performing state in the nation  is  if we want to remain competitive we need to think about what it will take to build on the strong foundation we have set here ” Chester said  “There’s no question we need to accelerate our

220,,,,,,,,,"('CONCORD  N H  — Two dozen state senators are scheduled to gather Thursday morning in the small granite Capitol here to decide whether New Hampshire will become the last New England state to repeal the death penalty After decades of legislative efforts  round after round of anguished testimony  and intense 11th hour lobbying  the vote is considered too close to call among the 13 Republicans and 11 Democrats who make up the chamber  nThe potentially historic decision  in a state that has long prided itself on Yankee conservatism  is believed to rest with a handful of senators who have not announced their decisions The House already has passed repeal by an overwhelming margin  and first term Governor Maggie Hassan  a Democrat  has said she will sign a bill that abolishes capital punishment State Senator Jeb Bradley  the Republican majority leader from Wolfeboro  is opposed to repeal but said he will not push for party solidarity  “We’re not making this a partisan or leadership issue  It’s a conscience issue ” Bradley said As the vote has neared  appeals to conscience have intensified  State Senator Nancy Stiles  a Hampton Democrat who backs the death penalty  said she has been lobbied to change her mind by John Broderick  a former chief justice of the state Supreme Court  and A  Robert Hirschfeld  the Episcopal bishop in New Hampshire When Hirschfeld called  Stiles knew the reason  “I told him  ‘You’re not going to like my answer  bishop  but I can’t get there ’ ” she recalled  n“I just don’t think it’s the right thing to do ” Stiles said of repealing the death penalty  “There are crimes that are heinous enough to warrant it  I don’t know that I would call it a deterrent  but it’s the price you pay if you set out to kill someone ”If the Senate votes to repeal  the governor’s signature on the bill will make New Hampshire the 19th state to abolish the death penalty  The last time both chambers of the New Hampshire Legislature voted to repeal capital punishment  in 2000  then governor Jeanne Shaheen vetoed the measure  Shaheen  a Democrat who is now a US senator  called the death penalty then an appropriate sentence in limited  heinous cases What has changed is that the state now has a governor who is willing to enact repeal  said state Representative Renny Cushing  a Hampton Democrat who sponsored the successful House bill The state also has become home to an influx of former residents from Massachusetts  which has long been regarded as a more liberal state and where capital punishment was abolished in 1984  nFor all the rhetoric swirling around the issue  the death penalty in New Hampshire seems to have more symbolic than practical significance  No one has been executed in the state in 75 years  and only one person sits on death row at the state prison in Concord That inmate  Michael Addison of Dorchester  Mass   was convicted in the 2006 shooting death of a Manchester police officer  His appeals already have cost the state several million dollars in legal fees  and there is no end in sight Even the slain officer’s police partner  John Breckinridge of Goffstown  has made a 180 degree turn from vehement support for Addison’s death to a belief that capital punishment is morally wrong “What was I trying to accomplish  What is anybody trying to do  It’s not going to bring anyone back ” said Breckinridge  now a security guard at St  Anselm College in Manchester  “It was revenge on my part  that’s all it was ”The Senate bill  if approved  would not affect Addison Ardent support for the death penalty — despite being limited to a few categories of crimes here — comes from the state’s association of police chiefs  some of whom are expected in the Senate gallery to monitor the debate “We look at the death penalty as part of our strategic plan to keep New Hampshire safe ” said Kensington Police Chief Michael Sielicki  the association president  “It’s used very sparingly ”The death penalty can be applied by a New Hampshire jury in the murder of a law enforcement official — police  judges  correction officers  and prosecutors  for example — acting in the line of duty Other offenses eligible for capital punishment include contract killings and murders connected with kidnappings  Execution would be by lethal injection  or by hanging if injection is not possible  After Connecticut repealed capital punishment in 2012  New Hampshire remained the only state in New England to retain the death penalty Sielicki said the issue has affected him in professional and personal ways  In 1997  he was police chief in Colebrook  a small town in far northern New Hampshire  when two state troopers  a judge  and the local newspaper editor were killed in a shooting rampage by a heavily armed loner And his niece  Sielicki said  was shot and killed in 1987 in an act of domestic violence  That gunman was sentenced to life in prison in New Hampshire The deterrent effects of capital punishment cannot be quantified  he acknowledged  but the sentence is a necessary tool — particularly to protect police officers When a police officer is attacked  he said  “you’re attacking our structure  our civility  and that’s not fair to our law abiding citizens  If you have such disregard for our government and our laws  that’s the sacrifice you should pay ”But some lawmakers whose families have been touched by murder have reached different conclusions Cushing’s father was gunned down at the door to his home in 1988  And state Representative Laura Pantelakos  a Portsmouth Democrat first elected to the House in 1978  reversed course and supports repeal despite the 2012 murder of her son in law  Greenland Police Chief Michael Maloney  who was killed as he helped serve a search warrant in a drug raid “I don’t think a police officer’s death is any more important than another ” said the 78 year old Pantelakos  who had consistently voted for the death penalty until recently Pantelakos also said she was troubled by questions of race in murder cases  Addison  the Dorchester man convicted of murder  is black and has been sentenced to death  But in the only other recent case of capital murder  a wealthy white man from Derry  John Brooks  was sentenced to life in 2008 in the contract killing of a handyman State Senator Donna Soucy  a Manchester Democrat  cast the tie breaking vote in the Judiciary Committee this month to recommend that the full Senate vote to repeal the death penalty Police and many residents in Manchester  the state’s largest city  retain painful memories of the death eight years ago of Officer Michael Briggs  who was on bicycle patrol with Breckinridge when they turned into an alley  where Addison shot Briggs at close range Despite lingering anger over that killing  Soucy said the possibility of legal errors in future cases is impossible to overlook “As careful as we try  our judicial system is not perfect  There is always the potential for someone who is innocent to be sentenced to death ” Soucy said State Representative Steve Shurtleff  the Democratic majority leader from Penacook  is a former Concord police officer and US marshal who changed his mind to support repeal  in part because of a conversation he had after Mass with his parish priest “The day of the death penalty has come and gone ” Shurtleff said  “I always thought because law enforcement was on the front lines  they would be more of a target  But someone who is so vicious to take someone else’s life wouldn’t think twice about it ”',

rescind the policies “Kids ought to be commended for being thoughtful and concerned and wanting to do something about important issues ’’ said Sarah Wunsch  deputy legal director for ACLU of

rode on bicycles alongside marchers  while others handled traffic at intersections When students formed a circle around intersections  kneeling hand in hand  officers simply held back traffic  even as the chorus of horns grew louder The march drew many bemused looks from pedestrians and clearly annoyed many delayed drivers  But others showed support for the students and said they exhibited a lot of initiative and restraint “It’s youth  and whenever youth get into a position like this  things could get out of control ” said Antonio Cordero  52  as he watched the demonstration move past the Boston

officer on any criminal charges stemming from a tragic shooting of an unarmed black man this past summer  Emotional  but largely peaceful  protests of the decision — and the broader problem of officer involved shootings of black men — occurred throughout the city  This calm  however  was no surprise  Even when Boston Police officers have been directly involved  in use of force incidents  our neighborhoods did not erupt in violent behavior or extensive property damage  Why  t nThe Boston Police Department has become adept at managing protests in the city  as evidenced by its peaceful and effective handling of the Occupy movement and the current Ferguson decision protests  Proper crowd management — during  for example  sports championships  festivals  or demonstrations — while also protecting citizens’ constitutional rights can be achieved through policy development  training  and careful planning  But in Boston  the lack of violence and destruction comes from something more  It is largely due to an unusual reservoir of trust developed between the police and the city’s communities of color  Ongoing conversations with community leaders  especially with a loosely allied group of activist black clergy known as the Ten Point Coalition  about race and policing in Boston seem to be effective in relieving the pent up frustration experienced in minority communities in other US cities Over the past three decades  the Boston Police Department has gone through a period of significant change and innovation  In what is a relatively short historical time frame  officers have reconsidered their fundamental mission  the nature of core strategies of policing  and the character of their relationships with the communities that they serve  Importantly  a neighborhood policing plan was implemented  and beat level officers were trained in the methods of community and problem oriented policing  While these changes were important in creating an environment where the police could collaborate with the community  residents of Boston’s poor minority neighborhoods remained wary of and dissatisfied with a police department that had a long history of abusive and unfair treatment  Strong working partnerships with local community church leaders were essential for establishing much needed community and political support for innovative police crime prevention efforts  By including the ministers in their community policing efforts  the Boston Police developed a mechanism for transparency and accountability that was very desirable to Boston’s minority community  Over the years  the Ten Point ministers  such as Reverend Jeffrey Brown  Reverend Ray Hammond  and Reverend Eugene Rivers  have helped the Boston Police manage several volatile events ranging from the accidental death of a 75 year old retired black minister who suffered a fatal heart attack after a botched drug raid to the more recent arrest of a young black man at Roxbury Community College that  at first blush  appeared to involve excessive force  When concerning incidents occur  the Boston Police immediately notify the clergy and other community leaders to explain their position on what transpired  The ministers demand that the police department take responsibility for its actions — investigate incidents thoroughly and hold those involved accountable  As it becomes clear that the Boston Police have accepted this responsibility  the ministers communicate to the community that the police are responding appropriately  This  in turn  prevents these situations from becoming racially explosive and provides the police with the continued political support they need to work effectively in inner city neighborhoods  Police departments acquire trust when community partners support appropriate police tactics and publicly criticize inappropriate police actions  Through their collaboration with the ministers — which has expanded to include the NAACP and other important partners — the Boston Police discovered a system whereby they were accountable to the community  And embracing accountability to the community has become a great asset to the police  Policing urban communities is very complicated and  given this complexity  it seems likely that Boston will experience future racially charged incidents  However  the city is well positioned to avoid riots through strong community partnerships and open communication lines  Clearly  Boston is not Ferguson', '2014_733')",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

color  t nDemocrat Martha Coakley  who disastrously eschewed campaigning outside Fenway Park during her failed bid for US Senate the same year  spent nearly an hour in snow and freezing temperatures mingling with tailgaters before the Patriots Broncos game at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough Both candidates paid respects at the late Boston mayor Thomas M  Menino’s wake at Faneuil Hall but also dived into a full schedule on the trail for the second to last day of campaigning For Coakley  the harsh weather from the weekend’s storm could hardly have been more cooperative in allowing her to offer a contrast  Her derisive remark in 2010 at the suggestion she campaign more aggressively — “Standing outside Fenway Park  In the cold  Shaking hands ” — was seized upon then as evidence that Coakley was too detached a candidate to beat the frenetically campaigning Republican Scott Brown  who this year is seeking a US Senate seat in New Hampshire Coakley sported a Sox cap and Dunkin’ Donuts cup as she emerged  gloveless and in rain boots  from the car on Sunday to walk from tailgate to tailgate in the Rodman Ford lot across Route 1 from Gillette She exchanged elbow bumps with fans whose fingers were covered in rib sauce and waited patiently while others shifted their beers into the crooks of their elbows so they could shake hands “I asked somebody on the way over here  ‘What’s the line out of Las Vegas ’ u2009” Coakley  who received an almost universally warm reception  told a tailgater at one stop “I’ve got to tell you  I wasn’t going to vote for you  because Scott Brown broke my heart ” Ted Gildea  a 33 year old North End real estate broker told Coakley  referring to her 2010 upset loss  “But having met you today  you got my vote ”“He broke everybody’s heart ” Coakley replied Outside the football stadium  Coakley turned down most offers of food or beer but made an exception for a Styrofoam bowl of fish chowder  which she ladled herself “I’ll make you a promise  If the Patriots win  the chowder will be in the speech ” she told a group of tailgaters taking refuge from the weather under a tent “If the Patriots win  you’re going to kick  expletive  on Tuesday ” one man taking a break from his beanbag toss game told Coakley “I like that ” she said Joined for the day’s stumping by her husband  retired police deputy superintendent Tom O’Connor  Coakley at one point accidentally kicked over a drink in a Solo cup and immediately tried to make amends by embracing its owner “Oh dear ” she said  “I just lost a vote ”Later  Coakley campaigned with former congressman Barney Frank at the Rose Alley Ale House in New Bedford  where she again raised questions about the topic that has dominated much of the campaign’s final days  Baker’s thus far unsubstantiated story about a tearful encounter with a fisherman in New Bedford during the 2010 campaign After both Baker and Coakley campaigned at a Mattapan church on Sunday morning  Baker returned to Boston in the afternoon and rallied a diverse crowd of about 85 supporters inside The Base  a Roxbury organization that provides baseball training and educational opportunities for student athletes “There are a lot of people in this room — we all look kind of different  Which is great ” Baker told the crowd  “But underneath it all  folks  we’re chasing the same dreams  And anybody who says otherwise is selling something ”Also in the crowd were fellow GOP candidates Patricia St  Aubin for auditor  Mike Heffernan for treasurer  Brian Herr for US Senate  John Miller for attorney general  and David D’Arcangelo for secretary of state Baker’s running mate  Karyn Polito  campaigned with him  saying  “This is a very close election  We have to make it happen ”Baker and Polito have been trying to make inroads in communities of color  particularly in Boston  and proposed an urban agenda that includes initiatives on education  economic development  affordable housing  and youth violence  Baker reminded the crowd that he is chasing “100 percent of the vote” and said people share the same aspirations  regardless of their community “I’ve seen the difference  He’s evolved ” said

upbeat closing argument from the candidate  his wife  Lauren  and his teenage daughter  Caroline  According to a Baker aide  the spot is set to air a single time Monday evening on three broadcast stations Like the vast majority of Baker’s advertising this year  the ad is positive and appears aimed at boosting voters’ positive perceptions of Baker  countering a barrage of negative ads that have aired against him over the course of the campaign  Polls consistently show that voters have a more favorable view of him than Coakley Although the candidates themselves projected mostly upbeat messages Sunday  their surrogates continued on in the embittered style of much of the campaign’s final weeks The two camps held dueling conference calls  with Democrats attacking Baker over his evolving explanations about the fisherman story  while Coakley critics charged that Coakley had been uninterested in pursuing a case against former House speaker Salvatore DiMasi Neither side

to youth  unify a diverse international community  befriend clergy of other faiths  Patient  accessible  dynamic  humble  fluent in Arabic and English  also American pop culture and public relations Finding the right person to lead New England’s largest mosque will not be easy  No one is as keenly aware of this as leaders of the Islamic Society of Boston Cultural Center in Roxbury  who moved their search for a new imam into high gear last month after the mosque’s first ever cleric  William Suhaib Webb  accepted a new job  t n“We’re expecting a superman ” 14 year old Hamza Mahmood said with a rueful smile after a recent community forum about the search The cultural center joins a growing number of US mosques scrambling to find religiously qualified  culturally conversant leaders at a time when such leadership is vital  said Jocelyne Cesari  who directs the Islam in the West program at Harvard University The need for strong American Muslim institutions — and capable religious leaders at their helm — seems particularly urgent at a time when the headlines are filled with news of beheadings by the Islamic State  an increasingly bloody Arab Israeli conflict  and the still fresh memory of the Boston Marathon bombings  whose lone living alleged perpetrator is about to stand trial Boston’s most high profile imam will have to speak to these issues internally and externally  while educating a new generation of American Muslims and helping to oversee a complex and increasingly crucial institution  nMany mosques in America are dominated by one or two ethnicities  but the Roxbury cultural center draws Muslims from an estimated 64 ethnic groups  speaking dozens of languages  There are also descendants of African American Muslim movements  as well as converts from various racial and ethnic backgrounds It is diverse in other ways  too  Scientists and struggling refugees  grandparents and teenagers  new converts and lifelong adherents pray shoulder to shoulder  holding an array of political and social beliefs The mosque has grown markedly in the last three years  adding programs for teenagers  converts  and classes on the spiritual and intellectual dimensions of Islam Webb and his congregation built stronger ties with interfaith leaders — improving  in particular  their relationship with the Jewish community following years of tensions surrounding the mosque’s early leadership And the mosque has immersed itself in civic issues  participating in a statewide campaign to expand gun control and bringing lawyers and activists to the mosque to speak  A health team offers free screenings and referrals  as well as connections to Muslim mental health counselors “We are set on a course       to be welcoming  to be diverse  to be open  to reach out to our neighbors  to reach out to the interfaith community  to make a positive difference for Muslims in America ” said Hossam AlJabri  a board member of the mosque  “That is exactly the vision Imam Suhaib promoted  and that’s exactly the position we’re sticking to moving forward ”Many imams in the United States are natives of Muslim countries who trained overseas  said Cesari  Though knowledgeable  they sometimes lack the language skills and cultural fluency to connect with the next generation of American Muslims  build relationships with interfaith leaders  and challenge misconceptions about Islam in American society The mosque leaders in Boston are “people who are well educated  who are professional  who want to educate their children about Islam and also project to the outside a certain vision of an educated  enlightened form of Islam ” she said  “They will not compromise ”Webb  a convert to Islam  is a celebrity in Muslim circles  known for his charismatic sermons and writings on bridging traditional Islam and contemporary American culture  After serving the Roxbury mosque for three years  he is leaving to become resident scholar at MakeSpace  a young Muslim organization in Northern Virginia  He and leaders of MakeSpace  which aims to reconnect young professional Muslims with their faith  said they started talking about a match a year or so ago “I was invigorated with the idea of my generation and the younger generation starting a congregation ” he said Mosque leaders insist they have no hard feelings about Webb’s departure  and understand his reasoning  Still  some of those involved with the mosque — including some converts — are distraught “I don’t think anybody can replace him ” said Mirtangelis Pena  a convert who studies at Bunker Hill Community College In the last several years  said Nancy Khalil  a doctoral student in social anthropology at Harvard and a member of the imam search committee  the mosque was little more than a seed Now  she said  “It’s a sapling       and it’s starting to blossom ”But tending its growth will be a challenge for the next imam The next imam “has to be somebody who will make everybody feel welcome  period ” said Dunia Kassay  a student at Northeastern University who has worked as an intern at the mosque The fledgling institution  with a staff of 11 and an annual budget of about $1 2 million  remains constrained financially  Monthly donors have more than doubled  from 150 to 370  in the last two years  but the mosque has less than six weeks’ reserves in the bank  and it has yet to raise money to put the finishing touches on its building “A lot of Muslim institutions are very nascent  still growing ” said Yusufi Vali  the center’s executive director  “In my eyes  we are still so far behind synagogues and churches  but so far ahead of most Muslim institutions ”A small contingent of anti Muslim activists in the Boston area has repeatedly claimed that the Roxbury mosque is fostering extremism  Those assertions have gained little traction but have proved draining for mosque leaders  nAt the same time  mosque leaders realize that they have to protect vulnerable young people from extremist propaganda online and elsewhere  Akbar Ahmed  the Ibn Khaldun Chair of Islamic Studies at American University  who visited 100 American mosques over a year for his book Journey into America  The Challenge of Islam ” noted that many young Muslim Americans find themselves “suspended between two cultures  neither of old culture  nor fully of new culture ”The fact that 100 young Americans have gone overseas to fight with the group that calls itself Islamic State shows the need for Muslim leaders who can reach these young people  he said “We have to ask ourselves  where are the imams  where are the political and social leaders of the Muslim community who could not prevent this from happening ” he said  advocating for US based imam training  nSafwan Eid  a University of Massachusetts Boston student and the mosque’s former youth director  whose father is a longtime imam and chaplain in Boston  said the antidotes are authentic teaching and strong  but human  teachers He added  “If you have the foundations of knowledge and character from a scholar like my father or Imam Suhaib  you won’t stray into radicalism and extremism  because you know those things are

waiting for their lunch to arrive  Deliverymen carrying pizzas and chicken wings would show up only to be shooed away by school staff “We had to keep confiscating pizza  getting on the PA saying  ‘No  you don’t ’” Sheila Harrity  Worcester Tech’s principal  recently told a contingent from Boston trying to breathe new life into their city’s struggling vocational high school and looking to schools like this as a road map to success  nIn many ways  Boston’s Madison Park Technical Vocational High School is where Worcester Tech was a decade ago  Back then at Worcester Tech  books were scarce and advanced placement classes essentially nonexistent  nAs American industry clamors for skilled technical workers — Massachusetts alone needs tens of thousands — vocational technical education has experienced a resurgence  From the White House to Beacon Hill to Boston City Hall  vocational education has emerged as one key to ensuring that students who aren’t necessarily bound for college don’t get left behind in the quickly shifting economy  nGone are the days when vocational education students were splintered from their college going peers  days when the prevailing belief was that a vocational education should focus on the vocation and not necessarily education  Today  educators say these schools give students the academic foundation to continue their education beyond high school in addition to specialized skills But Worcester Tech did neither of those in 2006 when Harrity arrived  and it was nearly five years before the tides began to change at the school  which is now regarded by federal officials as among the country’s best schools  with about 98 percent of its 1 400 students graduating in four years  and about 60 percent going on to college Now  it is Madison Park that is trying to stage a turnaround  Its fortunes and those of another embattled school  Roxbury Community College  were linked last year in a novel initiative launched by the governor and Boston’s previous mayor As the Boston group toured Worcester Tech’s state of the art campus and passed engaged students  it wondered  How can Madison Park replicate the success in Worcester  where the community at large  including businesses  higher education  and nonprofits  made the school a shared cause    n“You’re sitting on a gem that just needs to be polished  and I can say that because if we can do it  anybody can do it ” Harrity said She should know  Harrity arrived to a brand new  $90 million building nearly a decade ago  but the physical transformation did not immediately bring about a turn in the school’s fortunes  nMadison Park has long needed a reboot  More than two years have passed since former mayor Thomas M  Menino vowed to transform the school into a “top notch center for career readiness and workforce development ”But the promise has yet to come fully to fruition  The latest state figures show that at Boston’s lone vocational school  3 out of 10 students do not graduate in four years  only one third of sophomores can do math at grade level  and barely half of sophomores can read at that level And just last week  the Boston school district announced a series of interventions aimed at improving performance that could mean the involuntary reassigning of staff  including administrators Last summer  Menino and Governor Deval Patrick announced a partnership between Madison Park and RCC — essentially between the city and the state — that allows students to earn a high school diploma and an associate’s degree at the same time The high profile partnership  called the Roxbury Massachusetts Academic Polytech Pathway — RoxMAPP for short — is supposed to force both schools “to right their ships ” said state education Secretary Matthew Malone  It is expected to take five years for the RoxMAPP initiative to be fully implemented  but Malone is quick to caution that Madison Park cannot wait five years “You’ve got two institutions across from each other that have been failing kids for too long ” Malone said  “We can defy demographics  A community has come together  smart people both outside and inside  to force the creation of something special ”The program is overseen by a 22 member volunteer advisory board that includes health care  construction  and transportation specialists  elected officials  Boston School Committee members  and RCC trustees The hope is that every 11th  and 12th grader at Madison Park will also be enrolled at RCC   earning college credit and receiving technical training in one of up to about 24 career pathways The first group of 17 students started in the fall with much fanfare  They sat in a college classroom crowded with dignitaries “Remember today because the reason that all these folks are here       is because we are very vested in your success ” Patrick told the nervous students  all juniors studying nursing  “We need you ”Menino called the students the “next generation of leaders ”That was Sept  30  one month and six days before Martin J  Walsh was elected the city’s new mayor  And soon  Massachusetts will have a new governor Despite RoxMAPP being born at a time of transition  Malone said he believes it will remain a priority for Walsh and for Patrick’s successor Walsh showed his support by giving RoxMAPP a shout out during his inaugural speech  but the Commonwealth’s next governor must decide where the initiative will fit within a new administration Vocational education has been a rallying cry for the state’s 10 gubernatorial candidates  many of whom said they see it as part of a statewide economic development plan  By 2020  there will be a need for tens of thousands of well paying jobs that require at most an associate’s degree  Pharmacy technicians  Veterinary technicians  Registered nurses  Medical secretaries  Insurance agents  Carpenters  Cabinetmakers  Bank tellers  Loan officers  And computer controlled machine operators  nRoxMAPP’s first semester was tough  for students and teachers alike Every morning was spent at the high school’s nursing lab  with mannequins tucked into hospital beds  One  affectionately called Ms  Jones by female students  often swaddles a fake baby in her arms In the afternoons  students walked across the street to take a prep course  learning college level research and writing methods  Half of the class tested into English composition  the other half needed an intense boot camp to strengthen grammar  syntax  and vocabulary It was a surprise to administrators that more students didn’t test into English composition  one of several unforeseen hiccups  Then there were the logistical issues  Things like aligning high school schedules with college classes and clinical lessons  And most students did not have computers at home  so they spent evenings at the library until it closed at 10 p m   commendable but not necessarily safe as these were 16 year olds whose school days begin before 8 a m Opal Hines Fisher  the allied health coordinator at Madison Park who makes the 10  to 15 minute walk across the street to RCC with students every day  said “we assumed  just assumed” they had access to computers  A philanthropist donated laptop computers to each student  so the computer access issue has been resolved  nOn a recent Wednesday  students left Madison Park with snow flurries swirling and crossed Malcolm X Boulevard  Tamara Fils Aime said she and her classmates feel an intense pressure to succeed “The administration thinks highly of us ” Fils Aime said  “Sometimes  I don’t think we live up to that ”Still  there are those moments when she said the adults in their college level English course “turn to us and ask for our help  We are just as bright ”The 75 minute class begins promptly at 1 30

Connecticut  had been retired for about a year and half when she was persuaded to take the helm of the 37 year old school Her goal  she says  is simple  make Madison Park the school it should be  “Being the only technical high school in Boston  they should be breaking down our doors ” Gary said She said she wants all juniors and seniors to be able to take English and math classes at RCC   and a committee made up of staff from both schools is being formed to make sure freshmen and sophomores are ready to handle college courses by the time they enter 11th grade Gary wants more partnerships with area colleges and businesses  Already  she said  Wentworth Institute of Technology has agreed to redo Madison Park’s welding area  which the college would use at night and the high school would use during the day “Our welding shop has been down for I don’t know how many years ” Gary said But there are challenges ahead  too  she said  walking around the expansive building  which looks as if it was designed with City Hall as the inspiration  The building  she said  “is old but we make do ” There are boxes stacked behind gated nooks and outdated equipment in the culinary arts kitchen Restoring trust among students and staff is a must  she said  There was a period of instability after the school’s longtime headmaster retired in May 2012  “It’s a matter of getting people on the same page and understanding that Madison Park has had some problems and some issues and building the trust with the people here ” she said As she walks the halls  there’s still a bit of back talk from students  She asks them to pull up their pants  put away their cellphones  and pull the headphones from their ears “Put that away  please ” she says to a young man running an Afro pick through his hair “I can’t wear my hat  I’m going to pick my hair ” he says  continuing down the stairs while coiffing his hair  He does  however  lower the comb once he passes her  nIn January  the tour of the Worcester school by the contingent from Boston takes them to the Tufts at Tech Community Veterinary Clinic  which used to be a storage area until students in the construction program transformed it

volcanic soil — contains the country’s first and largest wine production area  “which is pretty much gone now ”The government reported no injuries or deaths  but said the 1 200 evacuated Chã das

kids there  they’re all happy and smiling ” she said A group of about 20 volunteers formed United for Fogo after the eruption  Rosario said The initiative launched a three day Internet campaign that raised more than $13 000  That fund raiser is now closed  so the money can be sent as soon as possible to the island The Fogo Fund  a relief nonprofit  has also been opened  Montrond said  Donations

restaurants  a pharmacy  and a community center  Her goal was simple  learn the needs of the neighborhood and share them with Republican candidates running for office  t n“Public safety  education for our kids  and affordable housing are our top three issues ” Nam Pham  executive director of VietAID  a 20 year old community development agency  explained to Hughes in a quiet conference room as the community center around them bustled with teens and seniors With six of its seven statewide candidates running unopposed in the September primary  the state Republicans are focused on buoying candidates to victory on Election Day in November  To do so in heavily Democratic Massachusetts  the party must expand its base in urban areas  places voters can be hard pressed to find Republican politicians out on the stump Hughes and other party leaders have vowed to change that this election cycle  Some national Republicans are making similar efforts to expand their appeal to a broader demographic  eyeing long term population trends  But in Massachusetts  where Democrats outnumber Republicans 3 to 1  they are simply looking for voters  nTuesday’s visit was the start of an 11 city tour for Hughes  who will speak with elected officials  business leaders  and community leaders  She is reaching out to voters in urban areas  where there are significant pockets of blacks  Hispanics  and Asians  and letting them know that there is a place for them in the Grand Old Party Some Republican candidates are tagging along  too  John B  Miller  who is running for attorney general  joined Hughes for part of Tuesday’s tour in Dorchester  Karyn Polito  candidate for lieutenant governor  will join her Thursday in Gardner  t nThe cities — Boston  Lawrence  Attleboro  Taunton  Lowell  Marlborough  Chicopee  Westfield Peabody  Lynn  and Gardner — are communities where the party feels it can make a difference  Hughes said “But also communities we typically haven’t gone to ” she said in a previous interview While some communities on Hughes’s tour  such as Marlborough and Gardner  can be more conservative friendly  others  such as Boston and Lowell  show Democratic leanings in statewide elections Republican losses in recent elections are often pegged to a failure to capture voters in urban areas  analysts say  with many pointing to Scott Brown’s Senate loss in 2012 as a prime example  Elizabeth Warren dominated in the cities and claimed the Senate seat “We’re not giving up the cities this time ” Hughes said  “That is just a no brainer from my perspective ”As Hughes networks with influential community leaders  another  more intimate form of outreach is taking place in parts of Suffolk  Middlesex  Norfolk  Bristol  and Plymouth counties The project  titled “I’m your neighbor ” is a much more grass roots campaign that has been slow to start but involves Republicans in cities connecting with the people in their neighborhoods  said Rachel Kemp  the only black woman elected to the Massachusetts Republican State Committee “It’s pointing out your house and saying  ‘I live there’         talking about the gas tax and making sure people know about it from the sidewalk ” she said in an interview  “We are really focused on building political infrastructure ”And so on Tuesday  Pham served as Hughes’s guide through part of Boston’s Ward 13  a diverse neighborhood filled with Vietnamese  African American  Caribbean  Cape Verdean  and Latin American residents They walked up and down a section of Dorchester Avenue that bisects the city’s Vietnamese community  Bilingual signs in English and Vietnamese advertised hair salons  dentists  frozen yogurt  and jewelry One bilingual campaign sign hung from shop windows and fences backing Steve Tompkins  a Democrat  running for Suffolk County sheriff “That’s what we need for every candidate ” Pham said At the corner of Dorchester Avenue and Charles Street  Pham pointed to a building with homes on the top and shops on the bottom  It was a bar until his organization bought it and redeveloped it  Pham said As they continued walking north  Hughes asked  “Do you feel like politicians come to your community  Do you feel that you are being outreached to enough ”“Yes ” he said “By Democrats or Republicans ” Hughes pressed “Mostly Democrats  We don’t have enough Republican politicians ” Pham replied They stopped inside of Pho Le  a popular restaurant at the corner of Kimball Street  where Miller met them Noshing on a mango salad  lotus salad  shrimp spring rolls  and beef skewers  they discussed public safety issues at certain stops on the Red Line  They talked about needing better data sharing and coordination between Boston and transit police As they talked  Pham noticed Van Le  a prominent real estate lawyer  sitting at a table with two others  He made an introduction  hands were shaken and pictures taken  Le works in Fields Corner but lives in Quincy  where Hughes is a city councilor Then the stump speeches began The conversations lasted just a few minutes  but they left a good impression  said Le  who thinks the neighborhood is far too often overlooked “The Republican Party has not had the best image of being as diverse as we would like  so this type of engagement is always positive because no one has a monopoly on good ideas ” said Le  who considers himself an

Catalyst and the pension fund came months after Baker donated $10 000 to the New Jersey Republican State Committee  which is controlled by the state’s Republican governor  Chris Christie  a Baker political ally  Baker said he made the contribution because of Christie’s support for him during his failed 2010 gubernatorial campaign against Governor Deval Patrick “Charlie has been completely

involved with the prisoner Fox went to meet  a former Brockton man  Darrell Jones  who was convicted of murder  Jones at the time was an activist on prisoner rights issues  and Marinova assisted him  But  according to Rich  the jury heard evidence that Marinova had been cleared two days earlier by DOC to visit Jones  without intercession from Fox  He said the jury also learned that Marinova never faced discipline from DOC  contrary to the Herald story that said Marinova had been “written up” and “bagged’’ for “engaging in ‘sexual acts’ with the killer con ”Rich said Jones had been issued a disciplinary report by the Correction Department because he kissed Marinova and touched her knee during a visit in 2008  Marinova  Rich said  never engaged in “sexual acts” with Jones The lawyer also said the department later dropped discipline against Jones because the actions did not qualify as “sexual acts’’ under corrections rules Rich said Jones and Marinova later married  but have since divorced  In court papers  lawyers for Van Sack and the Herald contended that the story was accurate based on the information provided to the reporter  And in a statement posted on its website Wednesday afternoon  the Herald said it stood by the story and Van Sack “The Herald has stated since its May 28  2009  article on a major security breach at Old Colony Prison was published that its article was entirely correct  from its headline to its last line ” the newspaper said on its website  “The article was meticulously researched  carefully written and extremely well documented  We are proud of it and the journalist who wrote it ”Herald spokeswoman Gwen Gage said the newspaper would not comment beyond what it said in its posting  which also stated that the Herald would continue to defend the story and Van Sack “Lawsuits like the one filed here are serious threats not only to the rights of a free and robust press  but to the rights of the citizenry that expects  and depends upon  that free and robust press ” the newspaper said  “The Herald fully expects to ultimately prevail in this matter ”A judge last year threw out a defamation suit filed by Tom Scholz  the leader of the

that his confirmation hearing has been postponed a month to allow more time for the public to weigh in and all the witnesses to testify Joshua Wall  who has been tapped for a seat on the Superior Court  has served as Parole Board chairman since February 2011  Patrick chose him to lead that panel after ousting five of its members who had voted to release a career criminal who then killed a Woburn police officer  Before that  Wall was an assistant district attorney for 18 years in Suffolk County  responsible for handling numerous homicide cases Defense lawyers have flooded the Governor’s Council  an obscure eight member panel that confirms judgeships  with letters and phone calls of opposition  citing cases in which they say Wall placed his drive to win ahead of basic fairness The parents of David Woodman  a 22 year old Emmanuel College student who died after being taken into police custody after a Celtics championship celebration in 2008  have also sent a letter of opposition  and are planning to testify at Wall’s confirmation hearing on Sept  17 The hearing was initially scheduled for Aug  13 but was postponed because councilors say they wanted to start in the morning and are expecting the hearing to last at least a full day “It is not in keeping with what I’ve seen with nominations to have this many people coming in opposition ” said Councilor Jennie L  Caissie  who added that she has received calls  e mails  and letters from lawyers who both oppose and support Wall “It seems to be a real steady flow  and it started as soon as his name was announced ” she said Wall declined to comment  saying it would not be appropriate while his nomination is pending Wall’s supporters  pushing back against the image of him as an overly zealous prosecutor  cite eight wrongful conviction cases that he handled between 2002 and 2011  They say Wall worked with defense lawyers to exchange exculpatory evidence  conduct forensic testing of old evidence  and file joint motions to vacate convictions Supporters also point to Wall’s work as chairman of a task force that revamped the way Boston police officers and Suffolk prosecutors use eyewitness identifications “Josh Wall’s superb performance as a prosecutor  his nation leading work on wrongful convictions and eyewitness identification procedures  and his professional stewardship of the Parole Board make him an excellent candidate for the Superior Court ” said Jesse Mermell  a Patrick spokeswoman  “We are confident that Attorney Wall will be found to be highly qualified and well suited to serve as an associate justice at his upcoming nomination hearing before the Governor’s Council ”Suffolk District Attorney Daniel F  Conley  who was Wall’s boss for nine years  said he believes  Wall’s opponents are unfairly criticizing him because of his successful career as a prosecutor “He’s one of the most balanced  ethical  and fair minded people I’ve seen in government  Period ” said Conley  who plans to testify in support of Wall Caissie and other councilors said it is too soon to say if Wall’s nomination is in jeopardy  It is rare  but not unheard of  for the council to reject a nominee  Caissie said she is keeping an open mind until Wall has a chance to respond to his critics at his hearing  Those critics include lawyers and others who question Wall’s demeanor and impartiality Woodman’s parents  Jeff and Cathy  say they feel Wall  as the point person who oversaw the Suffolk district attorney’s office investigation into their son’s death  “treated us as the opposition ” not as a grieving family “We felt treated as inferior to Mr  Wall by his condescending remarks during meetings  and body language that suggested he didn’t have time for us ” Cathy Woodman said in a letter to councilors  “We would have to remind ourselves that we weren’t on trial  that we did deserve some answers  even if it reflected badly on our son  we wanted to know ”David Woodman had been subdued by

heart’s electrical activity  He was hospitalized and died after another arrhythmia 11 days later Boston police and separate investigations by Suffolk prosecutors and an independent panel found that Woodman may have stopped breathing for several minutes before officers realized his condition  but that his death was not a result of the struggle  In 2010  to avoid a protracted legal battle  but the

told a national audience of investors Monday that they will create a bold “new medical model” by integrating hospitals and their medical services with insurance products and by drawing patients from across the country Speaking at the J P  Morgan Healthcare Conference  Partners’ chief executive  Gary L  Gottlieb  said his organization  which owns Harvard affiliated Massachusetts General and Brigham and Women’s hospitals in Boston  plans to improve medical care and lower costs by further expanding its network of community hospitals and primary care physicians in Eastern Massachusetts “We need to control our own destiny ” Gottlieb said before a standing room only crowd at the Westin St  Francis Hotel  during the industry’s largest global gathering of health care leaders and deal makers Among other moves  Gottlieb and chief financial officer Peter K  Markell hope to expand on a strategy to shift more routine health care to community clinics and hospitals  while marketing higher priced specialty care at Mass  General and Brigham and Women’s to patients around the region and nationally They offered no timetable for this plan Partners  which also owns seven community hospitals and other facilities in Massachusetts  rang up revenue of $10 3 billion last year  making it the largest health care provider in New England  It attracted about $1 5 billion in outside research funding  including about $800 million from the federal government The Partners presentation in San Francisco came days after the massive hospital and doctors system disclosed it will sell $425 million worth of bonds to finance new construction and other expansion initiatives As Partners has grown  so has scrutiny of its market dominance  with critics saying the system’s size contributes to more expensive medical care The Massachusetts Health Policy Commission wants Attorney General Martha Coakley’s office to reject the organization’s latest attempt to grow  with the proposed acquisition of South Shore Hospital in Weymouth  A review by the watchdog agency concluded the merger could drive up costs and restrict competition for health care services south of Boston  nLater this week  Partners is expected to issue a rebuttal Coakley’s office is nearing completion of a four year investigation  conducted with the US Department of Justice  into allegedly anticompetitive practices by Partners  Partners officials have said that expansion moves on the North and South shores will make it easier for them to integrate services  control costs  and treat more patients in community settings rather than in Boston Meanwhile  former Boston Mayor Thomas M  Menino last month lambasted Partners  the city’s largest private employer  for passing up land in Roxbury and deciding instead to consolidate administrative operations — and about 4 500 nonhospital employees — in a giant office complex being built at Somerville’s Assembly Row  Partners said the move to Somerville would be less expensive and afford easier commutes for its employees Partners executives did not discuss either issue Monday  but Markell noted the proposed acquisitions of South Shore Hospital and Hallmark Health System  which owns two hospitals north of Boston  are “going through the regulatory process ”Gottlieb  for his part  made a veiled reference to the regulatory oversight “Like elsewhere  the Massachusetts marketplace is interesting and it’s dynamic ” he said  “It may be a little more interesting and a little more dynamic than elsewhere because the government has intervened for an extended period of time  That has intensified and exaggerated some downward cautionary pressures ”To meet demands of patients  employers  and government officials for more affordable health care  Partners executives said  they have contracted with insurers that reward doctors and hospitals for keeping patients healthy  Between patients covered by such contracts and those signed up by Neighborhood Health Plan — a Medicaid managed care insurer Partners acquired in 2012 — it now has about 750 000 “lives under management ” Gottlieb said Partners may use that experience to offer its own commercial health insurance products to customers  executives said  Such products  if tailored as limited network policies  could keep patients within the Partners system   n“We are working real hard to combine our insurance expertise with our provider expertise to create a new medical model ” Markell said He said Partners’ bond issue will help it finance ongoing capital improvement projects  such as renovations and new construction at Brigham and Women’s in Boston and elsewhere  as well as initiatives such as an information technology system that will improve efficiency by better managing patients’ records and data “Anyone who wants to step up to the plate and buy the bonds right now         we’ll take the orders ” Markell told investors', '2014_121')",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

hospitals and doctors were creating a “new medical model” in a bid to “control our own destiny ”But within months  parts of the plan started to fray  Regulators grew increasingly hostile toward Partners’ desire to expand  tens of millions of dollars in losses piled up at a new in house health insurance arm  and some doctors and hospitals bristled at a push to standardize clinical practices  t nWhen Gottlieb said last week that he would step away from Partners next summer — leaving four years of a five year contract on the table — the news rippled through the state’s tight knit health care industry  raising questions about the organization’s direction Partners remains the largest health system in Massachusetts and runs some of the nation’s most respected hospitals  including Massachusetts General and Brigham and Women’s  But health care industry insiders say Gottlieb’s aggressive push for change and hands on management style alienated many people  from elected officials to labor leaders to executives at Partners’ own hospitals  nOthers faulted Gottlieb for what they see as mismanaging a bid to acquire South Shore Hospital and two Hallmark Health hospitals north of Boston  A deal with the state’s attorney general  Martha Coakley  that would allow the acquisitions to go forward is mired in controversy  A loud chorus of critics  led by competing hospitals  say Partners already is too dominant and too expensive  n“This may mark Partners’ peak in its ability to grow without justification ” said Alan Sager  a professor at the Boston University School of Public Health and a longtime critic of hospital mergers he believes drive up medical expenses  “More and more people publicly question Partners’ ability to save money  lower its costs  and lower its prices ” nPartners’ leaders  however  defend Gottlieb’s five year tenure as he prepares to take a job at Partners in Health  a nonprofit unrelated to Partners HealthCare Gottlieb “has helped shape and implement Partners’ strategy to offer patients more coordinated care  closer to their homes  at lower costs ” said Partners’ board chairman  Edward P  Lawrence  “But Partners’ vision for the future is bigger than one person  This vision and the strategy is shared and supported by senior leaders at our hospitals “This strategy also has full support from the members of our board ” Lawrence said Gottlieb  a psychiatrist with an MBA from the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School  is unapologetic about the moves he has made “We’re in a time of extreme change ” he said  “That means transforming a lot of the work we do  There are people who will have problems with that ”When he became chief executive in 2010  after leading Brigham and Women’s  Gottlieb sought to use his medical and business background to reshape Partners as a new era of more coordinated care and risk based insurance contracts was starting to sweep through the industry Gottlieb embraced payment models that reward doctors and hospitals for keeping patients well  a shift from the traditional system that pays providers for every test and procedure  regardless of the outcomes He also pushed doctors and hospitals to adopt high tech health information systems  jointly buy medical supplies  and adhere to a set of common procedures for everything from strokes to knee and hip replacements to how to handle patients post surgery “He saw the changes that were coming and he started preparing Partners for them  even when some of his colleagues urged him to wait ” said Andrew Dreyfus  chief executive of Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts  the state’s biggest health insurer Some executives at Partners’ prestigious Harvard affiliated hospitals resisted the moves  They believed Gottlieb was micromanaging decentralized procedures and protocols that had long been successful  said people familiar with the organization’s operations  Additional meetings and time commitments demanded from Partners headquarters only increased the friction Another high profile initiative championed by Gottlieb  Partners’ takeover of Neighborhood Health Plan in 2012  gave the health care giant a foothold in the insurance business But the Medicaid managed care plan has recently been deluged with claims for an expensive new hepatitis C drug and a surge of new members — many with serious health issues — assigned by MassHealth  the state Medicaid program  As a result  Neighborhood Health posted a loss of nearly $100 million in the first half of this year And then there was the question of Gottlieb’s ability to work with organized labor and other groups “Gary Gottlieb’s Partners is a major part of the problem ” said Veronica Turner  executive vice president of Local 1199 of the Service Employees International Union  who blamed Partners for underpaying hospital workers  “His successor will need to show better judgment ”Partners grew rapidly after the 1994 merger of Mass  General and Brigham and Women’s hospitals  But Gottlieb’s predecessor  James Mongan  came to stress a “better not bigger” approach  partly in response to increased regulatory scrutiny  Investigators were wary of a widening gap between prices at Partners and its competitors  nPartners today includes more than 6 000 doctors  10 hospitals  and several other health facilities  Its most recent deal — last year’s acquisition of Cooley Dickinson Hospital in Northampton — was the first to reach beyond the system’s Eastern Massachusetts stronghold Gottlieb channeled a widespread feeling at Partners that regulators were unfairly limiting its options while rival health systems were growing  especially Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Steward Health Care  In early 2012  he opened talks to acquire the 318 bed South Shore Hospital in Weymouth  one of the largest remaining independent hospitals in Eastern Massachusetts  He then looked to the North Shore  where he pursued Hallmark Health System’s hospitals in Medford and Melrose Competitors  antitrust specialists  consumer advocates  and others said the expansions would allow the high cost organization to increase its already strong market power and demand higher payments from insurers The Health Policy Commission  a state watchdog agency  said the South Shore and Hallmark deals  without proper checks  would raise health spending in the state by as much as $49 million a year In the spring  Coakley struck an agreement with Partners that would allow the transactions  but require it to tie prices to the rate of inflation  alter its contracting practices  hire an expert to track how well it follows those terms  and limit acquisitions for seven years The deal needs Superior Court approval  but Judge Janet L  Sanders has already voiced “serious concerns” about the impact of the settlement on health care costs   nA hearing is scheduled for Nov  10  after the state election in which Coakley is running for governor  But a decision is not expected that day  and could be months away Partners executives have said bolstering their network of hospitals is critical to coordinating patient care and keeping costs in check through more efficient care  Gottlieb’s successor and Partners’ board will have to decide whether to stick with that approach “The broad expansion  it’s not obvious that they need to do that ” said David E  Williams  president of Health Business Group  a Boston consulting firm  “Partners doesn’t need to expand at all and it would still be the biggest and strongest in the state ”Critics say Partners under Gottlieb also left potential allies disenchanted  Boston’s mayor  Thomas M  Menino  was infuriated last December when Partners said it would consolidate administrative operations outside of Boston  relocating 4 500 employees to a new office in Somerville  Menino  who wanted Partners to build a new facility near Roxbury Crossing  was insulted that Gottlieb did not call to tell him about the Somerville decision “The social conscience has gone out of Partners ” Menino told the Globe at the time  “This is all about their bottom line ”Partners’ board has not discussed whether the next leader should come from within the organization  as its past chief executives have  or whether it is time for an outsider Likely contenders include Peter Slavin  president of Mass  General  David Torchiana  head of the Mass  General doctors group  and Betsy Nabel  president of Brigham and Women’s  All three are doctors “The new CEO needs to guide this significant organization through the emerging demands of our health care system ” said Eric H  Schultz  chief executive of the insurer Harvard Pilgrim Health Care  “Partners needs to be able to show how they bring great value in terms of both quality and cost ” n•  n•  n•  n• • n•  n•  n•  n•  n', '2014_207')",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

vocational school  according to an internal School Department memo obtained by the Globe The memo calls for the shutdown to happen in three years  unless the school dramatically improves  Other recommendations focus on steps the School Department should take to try to prevent its closure  such as removing all administrators and admitting only students who are focused on vocational education  t nThe memo also criticized a high profile effort by the Patrick administration to help overhaul the school through a dual enrollment program with Roxbury Community College  calling it a “huge distraction ”“There are concerns about pairing a failing high school with a failing community college and whether the outcomes are positive for students ” the memo stated  urging a review of the program School officials have been tight lipped about the recommendations for weeks  keeping the June 8 memo secret from the Madison Park staff  The School Department released a copy to the Globe only after conducting a legal review  and then some portions about the removal of administrators and safety issues were redacted Interim Superintendent John McDonough said last week he is still reviewing the recommendations and is acting on some of them He is rejecting a recommendation to remove the headmaster  who has been on the job for only a year  believing a change at the top would create unnecessary instability and could potentially derail the overhaul  But he agrees with the need to remove seven other top administrators  he said  t nMcDonough also said that in general he supports the Patrick administration initiative    and that he found the proposal to replace Madison Park with an independent school thought provoking “I do welcome the fact that the recommendation challenges us to think more broadly about options that might work best for students ” he said The stakes are high for Boston to get Madison Park humming  A well run vocational school can prepare thousands of graduates for vocational or technically skilled jobs  helping to lift many of them out of poverty  Just last month  President Obama delivered the commencement speech at Worcester Technical High School  calling it a national model But Madison Park’s chronically deficient MCAS scores and low graduation rates have attracted much scrutiny from the state Department of Elementary and Secondary Education  which has the power to formally designate it an “underperforming school ” one step away from receivership Two and a half years ago — at the urging of then Mayor Thomas M  Menino and in effort to avoid state mandated interventions — the School Department launched what was supposed to be an aggressive overhaul of Madison Park  investing more than $1 million But the  as a series of temporary headmasters ran the school  and in March the School Department and Mayor Martin J  Walsh announced the creation of the intervention team  The team consists of three union representatives  three administrators  and the superintendent director of the Shawsheen Valley Technical School District in Billerica  None of the intervention team members has direct ties to Madison Park Although school officials have refused to release the recommendations to the Madison Park staff  pieces of it leaked out early last month  such as the possibility of closing the school and replacing all the administrators  raising concerns among staff members Tension rose further after McDonough unexpectedly showed up for a teacher training session on June 11 and announced that the headmaster  Diane Ross Gary  would be staying  several teachers said  He made no reference to the recommendation that she should go  causing some staffers to question the validity of the recommendations circulating via the grapevine The Faculty Senate later voted to ask the School Department to release the recommendations  nSome teachers criticize Gary  who never worked as a principal before but has extensive experience in vocational education  for what they say is poor communication  lax discipline procedures for students  and spending too much time in her office  The teachers asked to remain anonymous because they were not authorized to speak “At every corner  she makes bad decisions ” said one teacher But another teacher expressed some sympathy  saying “she inherited a messed up school ”“It’s an overwhelming task to straighten out ” that teacher said  “The pope could not straighten it out in one year ”Gary declined comment through a School Department spokesman The teachers interviewed say that McDonough and Walsh bowed to political pressure from some elected officials and from the Friends of Madison Park  who wanted to keep Gary in charge  believing she has the right expertise but needs more time  The Friends of Madison Park publicly voiced their support for Gary this spring in an article in the Bay State Banner  while members of the group and some elected officials met with Walsh Both Walsh and McDonough said politics played no role in the decision to keep Gary  saying simply that she deserves more than a year to prove herself and also needs the opportunity to appoint her own administrative team instead of inheriting one “When Dr  Gary was put into the job  a lot of supports weren’t there for her ” said Walsh  who acknowledged meeting with Friends of Madison Park and elected officials to talk about Gary and other issues at the school Richard Stutman  president of the Boston Teachers Union  said the recommendations by the intervention team raise a lot of serious concerns about Madison Park  but he said giving the school only three years to prove itself is too short of a timeline  He said the staff is dedicated to getting the job done “The staff wants to do the best they can ” Stutman said  “This is their school and their life  and they want to make this school work ”The recommendation about replacing Madison Park with a regional vocational school comes at the end of the seven page memo and offers no details  except to say that a new school should be established on a different site  It also notes that staff morale needs to improve The creation of a regional vocational school independent of the city’s school system would put Boston in line with how most vocational schools work in the state  functioning as separate entities from the local school systems Such a move would require approvals from the state education department and any community that would want to join in creating the regional vocational school Jim Stergios  executive director of the Pioneer Institute  a public policy research organization in Boston that has studied the state’s vocational schools  said separating vocational education from the Boston school system might be the best move “I’m really encouraged to hear they are thinking this way ” Stergios said  “The regional vocational schools  in Massachusetts  perform quite handsomely ”But other experts say Boston should not have to take such a step  noting that the Worcester school system oversees its vocational school Walsh said he prefers keeping vocational education within the jurisdiction of the School Department and voiced optimism about Madison Park “I think the changes we will make at Madison Park will be transformative ” Walsh said  “We have to get the school on the right track  We owe it to the kids ”',

better access to doctors Sherrilyn Ifill  director counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund   on the organization’s website that Dr  Edelin “was a fearless man of integrity and conviction ”  n“He was a powerful voice and advocate for civil rights ” she said Such advocacy  Dr  Edelin recalled in 2007  made him a target  He was indicted on a manslaughter charge that he had caused the death of a fetus after it was born alive and was convicted by an all white jury in Suffolk Superior Court  Dr  Edelin said the fetus had died in the womb of his patient  a 17 year old from Roxbury “A lot came together for them in my case ” Dr  Edelin told the Globe in February 1975  a day after his conviction  as he spoke about the prosecution  “They got a black physician  they got a woman more than 20 weeks pregnant  and they got a fetus in a mortuary ”In the early 1970s  with Boston under a federal court order to use mandatory busing to desegregate schools  race was a lens through which nearly every event was viewed  At the same time  the Supreme Court’s Roe v  Wade decision in 1973  which legalized abortion  reverberated in the heavily Irish Catholic city “In Boston  it was the perfect storm ” Dr  Edelin said in 2007  “It was the religious climate  it was the racial climate ”The city  he added  “had always been a cauldron when it came to women’s rights  It was the right place and the right time for those who wanted to make a statement  It was the wrong place and the wrong time for me ”Meanwhile  the prosecutor in the case was Newman A  Flanagan  an assistant Suffolk district attorney who planned to run for district attorney A year after Dr  Edelin was convicted and sentenced  the Supreme Judicial Court overturned the verdict  ruling that he had “committed no wanton or reckless acts in carrying out the medical procedures ”Dr  Edelin later served as chairman of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America  which in 2008 presented him with the   its highest honor  The organization called him “one of the heroes of the reproductive rights movement ’’Dr  Edelin’s wife  Barbara  said she sent an e mail to friends as his health was failing and noted that although he was best known “for his prochoice activities  Ken was so much more of a fighter for the poor and for African American women and for the disadvantaged ”She added that her husband led a more complex and nuanced life than a quick glance at his place in history revealed “He was funny  he was creative  he wrote poetry  he was a great friend ” she said  “And he was a teacher and mentor for many medical students  particularly for students at historically black colleges  I think his legacy is much more than what people know about from the trial ”Prior to the trial and afterward  Dr  Edelin held roles that were groundbreaking  prominent  or both  He was the first African American to be named chief resident of Boston City Hospital’s obstetrics and gynecology department In subsequent years  Dr  Edelin chaired the obstetrics and gynecology department at the Boston University School of Medicine and was director of obstetrics and gynecology at Boston City Hospital and gynecologist in chief at Boston University Hospital  He also was associate dean for student and minority affairs at BU’s School of Medicine  working to bring minority students into the school Dr  Edelin grew up in Washington  D C   one of four children born to Benedict Edelin  a postal worker  and the former Ruby Goodwin Still a boy when his mother died of breast cancer  “he decided then that he had to do something to make the world better for women ” “It was definitely personal  his career path ” his wife said “She was it ” Dr  Edelin told the Globe in 2007  recalling his mother’s death  “She was the center ”He said she showed him a mastectomy scar after surgery  and in later years he wondered  “Why would she show an 11 year old her scar  I think she wanted me to understand ”Dr  Edelin went to a segregated elementary school in Washington before attending the private Stockbridge School in Massachusetts on a scholarship  After graduating from Columbia University in New York City in 1961  he returned to teach at Stockbridge School before attending Meharry Medical College in Nashville  from which he graduated in 1967 Dr  Edelin’s marriage to Ramona Hoage  with whom he had two children  ended in divorce He met Barbara Evans on a blind date at a Super Bowl party during his manslaughter trial  “so he was a little busy ” she recalled with a chuckle  He had to leave early to meet with his lawyer to discuss strategy for the next day  and they did not see each other again for a long time  They married in 1978 A service will be announced for Dr  Edelin  who in addition to his wife leaves two sons  Kenneth Jr  of Middleton  Del   and Joseph of Atlanta  two daughters  Kimberley Edelin Freeman of Washington  D C   and Corinne of Atlanta  a brother  Milton of Piedmont  Calif   a sister  Norma Johnson of Wappingers Falls  N Y   and  eight grandchildren Among Dr  Edelin’s extended family is Jeh C  Johnson  the secretary of homeland security Remaining a prominent voice in the abortion debate  Dr  Edelin wrote in a Globe opinion piece in 2007 that “banning legal abortions would force desperate women to seek illegal abortions  to submit to dangerous procedures  often at great expense  and result in the deaths of many of them  This burden would fall disproportionately  as it did before Roe  on the poor women of our country ”Regarding his own case  the sting never lessened with time In 1988  he told the Globe that “the prosecution was vicious and unnecessary and personal  I’m still very angry at people who instigated it  who prolonged it  who profited from it  And I will be for a very long time ”', '2014_1148')",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

chatted with friends in Roxbury more than two decades ago  nNow  the City of Boston has agreed that it should pay a price for Drumgold’s errant incarceration  The city is giving Drumgold $5 million to settle his wrongful conviction lawsuit in the murder of Darlene Tiffany Moore  the 12 year old killed nearly 26 years ago  It is believed to be the largest such settlement in the city’s history  nDrumgold has already received his check from the city  He has set money aside for the college education of his two children and living expenses for his family  and he is considering attending college  said Rosemary C  Scapicchio  the Boston attorney who has pursued the civil litigation in federal courts since 2004 “It is a vindication ’’ Scapicchio said Wednesday of the decision by the administration of Mayor Martin J  Walsh to settle the litigation by Drumgold  who was not available for comment  “He spent 15 years in jail for a crime that he didn’t commit ’’In addition to the $5 million settlement  the city has spent more than $2 7 million in legal fees on the Drumgold case  The fear of continuing costs factored into the city’s decision to settle  a spokeswoman for Walsh said “Due to the inherent risk of a jury trial  the city decided to settle the case at this point in time ” spokeswoman Kate Norton said Drumgold was 24 when he was convicted of first degree murder for the killing of Moore  whose death was blamed on a feud between street gangs that exploded into gunfire on the summer night of Aug  19  1988  Moore was sitting on a mailbox when she was struck by bullets fired by two masked men who authorities said were aiming for a suspected gang member standing nearby  according to court records  nDrumgold took the stand at his Suffolk Superior Court trial and testified he was not near the shooting scene  and he had a friend testify in support of his alibi  The office of Newman Flanagan  then Suffolk district attorney  built the case largely on eyewitness testimony Drumgold was sentenced to life without parole and was still behind bars in 2003 when The Boston Globe reported that Boston police had been told that a key eyewitness suffered from brain cancer at the trial and that another witness claimed police fed him details about the murder The office of Suffolk District Attorney Daniel F  Conley  which had inherited the case from Flanagan  effectively vacated Drumgold’s conviction on the grounds that his trial was legally flawed — but without declaring that Drumgold was an innocent man who had been wrongly convicted No one has been charged since the Drumgold prosecution for the murder of Moore Mary Adams  a friend of Moore’s mother  Alice  who died in 1994  said Alice Moore wanted justice for her daughter and always hoped that the men who killed her child would someday be behind bars  At the same time  Adams said  Alice Moore would never approve of the imprisonment of an innocent man “She wanted the guilty party to be accountable ’’ Adams said  “But she wouldn’t want an innocent person to be punished ’’Adams knows Drumgold and his family and said she is convinced he was wrongly convicted  The city  she said  should pay him everything he asked for  “He spent a lot of wasted time in prison ’’ Adams said  “That’s the least they can do ’’One year after his release from prison  Drumgold sued Francis “Mickey” Roache  who was Boston’s police commissioner at the time of the Moore shooting  and three Boston police officers who investigated the murder  In 2009  a US District Court jury found that police withheld evidence but deadlocked on the question of whether it was the reason for Drumgold’s conviction  A mistrial was declared A new jury heard the case in 2009 and ruled in favor of Drumgold  awarding him $14 million — $1 million for each year he spent in prison  But that verdict was overturned by the First Circuit Court of Appeals in 2013 when a majority ruled that the trial judge gave improper legal instructions that may have influenced their verdict in Drumgold’s favor Scapicchio said the legal struggle continued until this year  when Walsh’s administration agreed to have a mediator resolve the matter  which he did in April  Scapicchio said Drumgold accepted the lower figure of $5 million because he believed it was a fair offer that would end the litigation “This is the first time that there was enough money on the table to talk about resolving’’ the lawsuit  said Scapicchio  who  along with co counsel Michael W  Reilly  will collect $1 6 million in fees  “Five million dollars is a lot of money to walk away from “I am very confident that if we tried the case again  we would have gotten another  favorable  jury verdict ” Scapicchio said  “But Shawn’s been waiting 10 years for his case to get resolved  I think he got to the point where he just didn’t want to wait any longer ’’Scapicchio said the settlement is the largest payout from a Boston agency for a wrongful conviction  surpassing the $3 2 million paid to Stephan Cowans  who was exonerated by DNA testing from having any role in a nonfatal shooting of a Boston police officer  Cowans spent six years in prison before testing showed that a fingerprint was not his and that the DNA found on other evidence was not a match Cowans was shot to death in his home in Randolph in 2007  n', '2014_139')",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Allah had served his time  reformed his ways  been forgiven by the victim  and dedicated his life to helping steer at risk youth and inmates to lives of purpose instead of ones of crime “I believe in accountability  but I also believe in redemption ” Suffolk District Attorney Daniel F  Conley said in testimony before the Governor’s Council  an eight member panel that approves or denies pardons submitted by the governor  “He is redeemed ” the hard bitten prosecutor added The victim’s widow  on behalf of her and her family  publicly forgave Allah at the hearing A top public safety aide to Mayor Martin J  Walsh of Boston  top former Boston Police Department officials  and Andrea J  Cabral  the state’s executive secretary of public safety  also testified in favor of a pardon for Allah  who works for the Suffolk County sheriff’s office helping inmates make the transition from jail to freedom “This man exemplifies exactly what the criminal justice system promises if one does the work ” Cabral said  adding that in all her years in law enforcement — as a prosecutor  sheriff  and top state official — she had “never known anyone more deserving of a pardon than True See Allah ”Damequa Williams  the widow of the victim  said she and her family missed her husband  MacArthur Williams Jr   every day  He was paralyzed in the 1989 shooting and died of bladder cancer in 2010 But  she said  just as her husband had  she forgives Allah “I want you to know that I forgive you  I have no hard feelings  and I wish the very best for you ” she said  before giving Allah  44  a hug He told the council he is seeking a pardon  in part  to allow him to advance in his career  Allah  whose name was then Troy C  Watson  was not the shooter  He was convicted of armed assault with intent to murder and assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon for his role in instigating the shooting of Williams Allah  a former gang member  served more than eight years in prison for his crimes  There  he said  he joined the Nation of Islam and changed the direction of his life Speaking to the council  Allah  a Roxbury resident  said he devoted his career to helping reduce violence in Boston  steering young people away from gangs  and helping current and former inmates rejoin society without returning to their old ways Allah said he takes full responsibility for his crimes  And he told the council he wanted a pardon to be able to expand his efforts beyond his current role  perhaps including a run for public office “I’d like to be able to apply for any job within the Commonwealth and be able to be considered based on the merit of my professional history  not because I had a criminal past to be overlooked ” he said  “For me  a pardon would be huge  it would be monumental  because it would wipe the slate clean ”Patrick’s proposed pardon for Allah  which effectively would expunge his criminal record  is one of four the governor submitted to the council  They are the only pardons of his almost eight year term  So far  the council has approved two Allah is the only one of the four seeking a pardon for a violent offense The state Parole Board  acting as the Advisory Board of Pardons  recommended to Patrick that Allah be pardoned for crimes including those related to the shooting as well as drug and gun offenses from the late 1980s Patrick submitted the conditional pardon  which would not restore Allah’s ability to lawfully carry a firearm  to the council for its consent It requires a majority vote  The council is expected to vote on Allah’s pardon on Jan  2 When the council asked if anyone wanted to testify against the pardon  there was only silence  No one came forward to speak against it  questioning Allah for hours  councilors grappled with the severity of the crime and the fact that Allah  who is married with a daughter  is already employed and appears to have a comfortable life Councilor Terrence W  Kennedy spoke about Williams never being able to get a pardon from a life using a wheelchair and wondered how to balance the “horrific” crime against the “wonderful things” Allah has done with his life since he got out of prison “I think you’re a great human being at this point in your life and you’re doing probably more than I’ve ever done in my life to help people ” he said  “But I still have to weigh it against what happened to this poor man ”Through all the testimony  Damequa Williams sat quietly watching  her expression often pained  She later said it was an extremely difficult day for her  her children  and MacArthur Williams’s parents  And for all the discussion of the good Allah has done  Williams said she wished there had been more focus on the positive deeds her late husband had done in the years he was in the wheelchair',

as an athletic trainer at Keene State College when he sexually molested a summer camper  a 15 year old boy Paul  who was 32  pleaded guilty to four counts of sexual assault and was sent to the county jail  Four days later  he sexually assaulted another inmate  a judge ruled  and he was ordered to serve the balance of his 2½  to 7 year sentence at the New Hampshire state prison  t nToday  Paul is a registered sex offender  living in Framingham and classified as Level 2 — a moderate risk to reoffend  He is also a regular in referee pinstripes on basketball courts around the region  one of a number of ex convicts who are listed by the Massachusetts Interscholastic Athletic Association as qualified basketball officials  eligible to judge right from wrong for student athletes in contests across the Commonwealth A limited review of state court records by the Globe found at least seven other referees who have been convicted of serious crimes — offenses ranging from distributing cocaine in a school zone and illegally possessing handguns on the streets of Boston to larceny  embezzlement  and gambling  But most of their crimes have been a secret to the public because almost no one responsible for ensuring the safety of the state’s student athletes  including the MIAA  is checking the criminal records of the 7 600 referees who are eligible to officiate in Massachusetts schools The MIAA lags behind a national movement of state high school athletic associations launching screening programs for officials  Consequently  no one knows how many current or former offenders are calling fouls on the state’s student athletes “It’s a head scratcher ” said Steve Ray  a longtime high school basketball coach and referee in Pittsfield  where Darryell Drumgoole was convicted in 1999 of distributing cocaine in a school zone Drumgoole is now a certified basketball official who referees school games in Berkshire County “You see guys with drug convictions and you wonder how they got through the system ’’ Ray said Like other ex offenders identified by the Globe  Drumgoole said he has turned around his life in the many years since his conviction  Drumgoole said he has paid his debt to society in prison time and should be allowed to officiate  Paul declined to comment  At least 20 states require criminal background checks for athletic officials in schools  and Tom Lopes  executive director of the International Association of Approved Basketball Officials  said he expects every state one day to screen referees for criminal records But there has been little action in Massachusetts  The vast majority of sports associations that train and certify referees listed by the MIAA do not conduct criminal background checks  Nor do school districts  State law requires school employees and volunteers who may have unmonitored  direct access to students to be screened for a criminal record  Tom Scott  executive director of the Massachusetts Association of School Superintendents  said the superintendents believe the referee checks are necessary and have asked the MIAA to conduct them  to no avail  On Friday  the MIAA’s associate executive director  Richard Pearson  said his organization is taking the matter “very seriously ’’ He said the MIAA’s board of directors is scheduled to receive a final report on the issue in February and will decide no sooner than next fall whether to begin screening referees for criminal records Scott said school superintendents consider the issue urgent enough that they may ask the Massachusetts Legislature to require the MIAA to administer the checks “We need to make sure we are doing our due diligence ’’ he said The Globe screened the state’s 2 500 certified basketball officials by reviewing the Massachusetts Sex Offender Registry and criminal dockets at the state’s 20 superior courts  Basketball officials represent the largest group of certified referees who work inside school buildings The review did not cover offenses tried in the state’s 70 district courts because no central database is publicly available for records in those jurisdictions  District courts handle most of the state’s criminal cases  felonies punishable by up to five years in jail  all misdemeanors  as well as violations of city and town laws  Nor did the Globe review cover out of state jurisdictions and federal courts Still  even the limited sampling yielded at least eight cases that could disqualify the former offenders from officiating in some states that conduct background screening  Some of their offenses occurred long ago  and several of the referees are officiating college or recreational games rather than school contests   In Paul’s case  the MIAA has taken no action despite knowing about the worst of his criminal record for nearly a decade  He had been officiating school games for nearly 10 years when he was charged in Peabody in 2003 with failing to register as a sex offender in Massachusetts  The MIAA was made aware of his Peabody arrest and New Hampshire convictions by newspaper reports on the North Shore in 2005 Those reports did not cite Paul’s arrest at Moakley Park in South Boston in 2002 on a charge of indecent exposure  Police officers allegedly witnessed him engaging in sex there with an adult male  The charge was dismissed on the condition that Paul pay $300 in court costs Nor did those news reports cite Paul’s conviction for sexually assaulting a minor in Fairfield  Conn   in 1977  a year after he graduated from the University of Bridgeport  He received a 30 day suspended sentence in that case and a one year conditional discharge The news coverage effectively cost Paul his Massachusetts license as an independent clinical social worker  State records show he received the license in 1996 and lost it in 2005 after the Board of Registration of Social Workers convened a disciplinary hearing on his criminal record But his officiating career continued  thanks both to the MIAA’s inaction and his support from leaders of an International Association of Approved Basketball Officials chapter on the North Shore  which trains and certifies referees Paul Halloran  a member of the chapter’s executive board  said in a recent interview that the organization was not aware of any convictions on Paul’s record other than his guilty pleas in 1986  He said the chapter has maintained Paul’s certification because it has found no evidence of any wrongdoing by him as an official in the many years since those convictions and because his colleagues consider him a productive citizen of good character “I understand the severity of his crime and the ramifications it may have had for the victim ’’ Halloran said  “But many years have passed  and I have come to know Phil very well  I consider him a friend and a decent guy  and nothing he has ever said or done in my company has made me hesitate about him refereeing a basketball game or being at the dinner table with my family ’’ Yet Paul’s criminal history requires him to remain a registered sex offender in Massachusetts for life  nOpponents of background checks note that crimes by school sports officials are rare  But they do occur In Colorado last year  the high school athletic association began requiring background screening after Stephen Amador  a basketball referee with a criminal history  was convicted of groping four girls who were competing in games he was officiating In Oregon in 2011  a high school basketball referee was charged with sexually assaulting a 13 year old girl  Later that year  school referees in Arkansas and Kentucky were charged with drug trafficking  Those cases did not involve students  but they contributed to safety concerns among school officials   nWisconsin and Washington began checking criminal records after basketball referees were charged with making bomb threats and drug trafficking  respectively The only New England state that requires background checks is Connecticut  according to a recent study by the National Federation of State High School Associations  A spokesman for the Connecticut Interscholastic Athletic Association  the MIAA’s counterpart there  said the screening began three years ago after the agency’s leaders saw an increasing number of states require background checks and determined “it was the prudent thing to do ’’The MIAA  however  has yet to conclude that school sports officials have direct  unmonitored access to students — the legal threshold for requiring background checks in Massachusetts “As best we can tell  officials have very little contact with players  except in public when the games are being played ’’ said Paul Wetzel  spokesman for the MIAA Many referees share that view “We’re basically hit and run people ’’ said attorney Alan Goldberger  a longtime basketball official in New Jersey and author of “Sports Officiating  A Legal Guide ’’“We come into a venue and often have our own dressing room ’’ Goldberger said  “Sometimes we walk onto the court or the field in the company of a police officer  and then we go back to our cars  That’s it ’’Many Massachusetts sports officials undergo criminal background checks in their additional roles as teachers  coaches  or referees in youth leagues  Dozens also officiate more than one sport and worry they could be subject to repeated  time consuming checks through the state’s Criminal Offender Registry Information  or CORI  system  “Between the schools and summer leagues  some officials could be CORI’d constantly ’’ said Tom Stagliano  president of the Eastern Massachusetts Soccer Officials Association  which does not conduct criminal background checks on its members  The largest organization of MIAA affiliated referees that requires background checks is the Eastern Massachusetts Lacrosse Officials Association  with more than 400 members  For six years  those officials have been subject to CORI inquiries The screening is “part of our primary responsibility as sports officials  to provide a safe environment for players ’’ said Darrell Benson  the association’s president Benson said at least four prospective lacrosse officials have been discouraged from completing the training program “because of the prospect of them failing a CORI check ’’Wetzel said the MIAA approves of certifying organizations screening officials  But the MIAA’s failure so far to undertake background checks clashes with the policy of the National Federation of State High School Associations  of which the MIAA is a member  The federation believes all governing bodies such as the MIAA should launch screening programs “The world is very different now ’’ said Theresia Wynns  the federation’s director of sports and officials education  “If you have pedophiles  you are providing them an opportunity to stake out or lust after individuals  so it’s in our best interest to protect our young people  We do that with background checks ’’The MIAA classifies athletic officials as independent contractors and recommends how much schools pay them — from $50 for a junior varsity softball game to $85 for a varsity football contest  During regular season competition  the home schools hire and pay referees for interscholastic games  For postseason tournaments  the MIAA is responsible for staffing and paying officials The MIAA’s formal relationship with sports officials includes the agency assessing a $6 annual fee on each of the 7 600 referees listed on its website for all different sports When Wetzel was asked for this story why the MIAA took no action in Paul’s case after learning he was a registered sex offender  he described it as “a judgment call ’’Despite the MIAA’s tacit approval  Paul’s high school officiating opportunities diminished as word of his convictions spread  He officiated his last MIAA tournament game in 2009 and has since refereed only a small number of high school games In recent years  Paul has mostly officiated men’s games for the Eastern College Athletic Conference  However  Larry Last  who assigns officials for ECAC men’s games  said Paul  at 60  has struggled to keep pace with high speed collegiate competition and will referee his last ECAC game next month  nThe Massachusetts law on criminal background checks permits school districts to determine which independent contractors should be screened and which offenses should disqualify them from jobs  But one rule seems generally accepted “If you’re a registered sex offender  that’s going to be a problem ’’ said Jacqueline Reis  a spokeswoman for the state Department of Elementary and Secondary Education  which administers the law The National Alliance for Youth Sports advocates disqualifying any official who has been convicted of major crimes  including sex  gun  and drug offenses  no matter how long ago they occurred Sex crimes also are considered disqualifiers in the states that currently screen sports officials for criminal records  The rules otherwise vary by state on which crimes should bar a referee from working school games Some states disqualify anyone convicted of a felony in the past five years  while others bar anyone with felony convictions in the previous 10 years  Still others  such as Connecticut and North Carolina  have no time limits In those states  Paul  Drumgoole  and other ex offenders identified in the Globe review could be barred from officiating despite the lengthy periods since their crimes — a policy that strikes some former convicts and their advocates as unfair Massachusetts has adopted policies aimed at making it easier for ex offenders to become productive citizens  Under the CORI law  background checks cover only felonies committed in the past 10 years  which means Paul’s and Drumgoole’s CORI records are clean In Drumgoole’s case  a Berkshire County jury found him guilty in 1999 of two counts related to distributing crack cocaine in Pittsfield in 1997  He also had been convicted of intimidating witnesses and threatening to commit a crime after he allegedly clutched a handgun in a 1997 street confrontation with his wife’s ex husband Drumgoole was sentenced to 43 days in jail for the intimidation incident and received a 5  to 8 year prison term for the drug convictions He now is a member of the Berkshire County chapter of certified basketball officials  He also is a substitute teacher in the Pittsfield public schools While Drumgoole might be barred in some states from refereeing school games  he said it would be unjust to terminate his officiating career  He said he has served his time and has not reoffended “I understand what the superintendents are saying ’’ Drumgoole said  “Criminal background checks make sense  But you don’t want to take jobs away from people who have paid their debts to society “I had one bad year ’’ he said  “I’ve battled long and hard to reinvent myself  so as I move forward all these years later I want to be able to walk into a job

Andrew Puglia  a former Somerville alderman  A disbarred lawyer  Puglia pleaded guilty in 2001 to embezzling more than $160 000 from his clients  He was ordered to serve six months in jail and repay the stolen money  He was on probation until 2012 Now Puglia  like Paul  is a certified member of the North Shore chapter of basketball officials  He did not respond to requests for comment  Executive board member Halloran said chapter officials were not aware of Puglia’s conviction until they were contacted by the Globe  He said Puglia has agreed to discuss the matter with them as they review his status  nAmerican culture is rich with redemption stories  Good citizens in many walks of life have overcome criminal pasts  In Boston  Jahmahl Galloway’s supporters cite him as an example In 1992  Galloway had recently completed a promising basketball career at the former Mission High School in Roxbury  when he was charged with illegally possessing a  25 caliber handgun in a gang menaced area of Humboldt Avenue  He was placed on two years of pretrial probation Before Galloway completed his probation  officers assigned to the Boston police antigang violence unit searched a car he was driving in Roxbury and discovered an unlicensed loaded handgun  ammunition  and marijuana  He then was sentenced to a year in jail Galloway was 19 when he was first arrested and 22 when he entered the house of corrections Twenty years later  he is considered one of the top high school basketball officials in Boston  His supporters say it would be a shame to strip him of his officiating job “A lot of us made mistakes when we were kids ’’ said Madison Park boys’ basketball coach Dennis Wilson  who has known Galloway since he was a child  “I believe everyone except murderers and rapists deserves a second chance  and certainly Jahmahl does  I have seen the changes in him ’’Galloway  now 42  a foreman at Boston’s Fairview Cemetery  has officiated title games in the city high school playoffs as well as MIAA state tournament contests  He said he referees in part for his love of the game and his potential to help at risk youths “A lot of players or their parents know about the experiences I went through and see the strides I’ve made ’’ Galloway said  “Refereeing has given me an opportunity to help some kids who are on the fence and maybe heading the wrong way  I can let them know about going the right way ’’Galloway embodies the challenge some state athletic associations face in balancing student safety with the employment rights of school sports officials “We’re in the integrity business ’’ said Mark Uyl  assistant director of the Michigan High School Athletic Association  “In the ideal situation  anybody with any conviction probably shouldn’t be an official  But you also have to look at the reality of life  People make mistakes  and sometimes we have to make judgment calls ’’Background checks in Michigan have turned up convictions in about 6 percent — or more than 700 — of the 12 000 school sports officials who have been screened  Many of those offenses were minor  Uyl said  but others were serious enough to end officiating careers He said the risk of allowing those ex convicts to work in the schools was too great to bear', '2014_1103')",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

districts are not given access to academic support  mentorship programs  and other enrichment activities that are offered by programs that extend the length of the school day   n t nResearch shows that by age 12  a child from an affluent family will have received 6 000 more hours of enrichment activities  including academic tutoring  library visits  and music lessons  than a child from a less affluent family  That gap has more than doubled over the past 40 years  We are systematically denying students from low income families 6 000 hours of engaging learning opportunities  in the middle school grades  These are the years of their most formative cognitive and non cognitive development This opportunity gap creates an equally pernicious achievement gap  Over 80 percent of African American and Latino fourth graders are not proficient in reading and math  only 60 percent of students from these minority groups are graduating from high school on time  Every 26 seconds a student drops out of school in our country  And this opportunity gap has only doubled in the last generation The Education Reform Act of 1993 has been wildly successful  resulting in Massachusetts public schools ranking highest in the nation for academic performance  But for all of our success  the one unmet promise of education reform is the stubborn persistence of the class based achievement gap  Closing the educational gaps is a solvable problem  But it requires an “all hands on deck” mentality  Public schools are increasingly accountable and leaders are faced with making difficult decisions around their available resources  This is causing inequality of out of school time to grow  but educational reforms are identifying practices that have data driven and dramatic impact  At the national nonprofit organization Citizen Schools  we have developed an innovative “Expanded Learning Time” school model that connects underserved middle school students with resources from their own communities  providing two and a half additional hours for more academic instruction and practice  more relationships with caring and successful adults  and more opportunities to participate in hands on projects that help make connections between academics and future college and career success  Each Citizen Schools program mobilizes a team of adults — AmeriCorps members  aspiring educators  and professionals from the community — to enhance learning alongside a school’s faculty We have found we can reduce or eliminate the achievement gap  From 2007 through 2012  Citizen Schools implemented extended learning time in four Boston Public middle schools over multiple years  helping to lift average proficiency rates in these schools by 30 percentage points  19 percent to 49 percent  in math and by 14 percentage points  31 percent to 45 percent  in English Language Arts  The Edwards Middle School launched ELT in the 2006 07 school year  when it  one of the lowest performing schools in the state  Within four years  the school’s eighth graders closed the achievement gap in math and language arts in full compared to their peers across the state  Similarly and more recently  Orchard Gardens K 8 Pilot School in Roxbury went from one of the state’s lowest performing schools to one of the highest performing  and the improvement was most pronounced in the middle school grades where Citizen Schools was the lead partner to the school  These Expanded Learning Time schools are helping to prove that when Boston district schools adapt the key tenets of high performing charter schools  they can produce similar learning gains for students  In fact  student growth at the Citizen Schools ELT schools in Boston is comparable to student growth at the city’s top charter schools  Citizens Schools has found that a longer school day is the key to providing underserved students with the experiences  enrichment  relationships  and social capital they need and deserve to explore their interests and achieve their dreams   the American Dream  Our goal is that a school day  like what Citizen Schools provides  becomes the new normal in education  It is critical to ensuring equity and excellence in urban education in the 21st century in Massachusetts and nationally Many of us have been fortunate to have mentors as we grew up and developed our interests  In 2013 2014  over 4 000 professionals volunteered their time to teach hands on apprenticeship classes  with over half of the projects focused on science  technology  engineering  and math  topics  The apprenticeships reinforce lessons taught during the school day and engage families more deeply with the school through regular contact with each student’s parents or guardians  a key tenant of our program As we excitedly enter a new school year  we hope that others will join with us to ensure every student in urban districts have the same access to educational  mentorship  and enrichment opportunities as

African American playwright and decided she had to try something different “I come from a kind of specific experience of being of African American and Creole descent  but also of growing up in the suburbs — my father was a doctor —  and  going to private schools that were mostly white ” she says   n“I had an agent at William Morris who had read one of my plays that was very much based in the Creole African American experience  and she wanted to see the rest of my work  And the rest of my work was not based in that experience  and basically she was like  ‘I can’t represent you right now ’ u200a” Girod says  “I found what I was up against  that my expression as a black playwright could only be understood through one lens ”She founded  in New York to move beyond existing ideas of “black theater ” The annual festival began in New York in February 2010  offering 10 minute plays by early career African American playwrights without those expectations of what they’d write about   nThis weekend a group of festival veterans brings a sampler to Hibernian Hall in Roxbury  They’ll offer a selection of six short plays from the festival’s first four years  performed by four actors and directed by festival veteran Nicole A  Watson  “The bottom line is it’s a festival where the artists of color get to make the choice in curating and producing ” Watson says  “The idea of this festival is there are a lot of theater artists  a lot of writers  a lot of actors  and we want to do our jobs  We want to work  And we have a festival that gives us that chance ”The festival’s name derives from the title of a James Baldwin essay collection  “The Fire Next Time ” which he took from the Bible  A quote from Baldwin appears on the festival’s website under “Mission”  “There is something terribly radical about believing that one’s own experience and images are important enough to speak about  much less to write about and to perform ”Generally the African American plays that get produced in America’s mainstream theaters “speak about the same things ” festival producing artistic director Kevin R  Free says with a chuckle  “Often the people who are producing want to see how we have overcome  There’s a certain amount of protest kind of theater that is produced by people because they like to see angry black people onstage “ But  as a playwright I tend to be kind of abstract — maybe heady is a better word — and I also enjoy writing comedy ” Free says His “PORTAL  or Metaphorical Tricycle ” appearing here  resulted from an assignment at another theater company to write about a tricycle that had been left backstage  The monologue he wrote then has turned into a surreal play that leaves the fourth wall in rubble Girod’s “Poetics of the Creative Process” is more realistic  charting a meeting between a male professor at a Louisiana university and a female student who thinks he’s trying to seduce her  In outline it resembles David Mamet’s “Oleanna ” but it’s very different  going to dark places in language that’s almost musical at times  “That piece started as a poem ” she says  The festival’s first year in New York sold out before it started  Girod says  and it has continued to be a hit  moving into a larger venue and expanding its programming  The fifth year  just ended  included the first production of a full length play  Girod and Free say the Boston shows  the festival’s first road trip  are another big step Hibernian Hall artistic director Dillon Bustin attended the festival in New York last year and started working to bring the plays here  The six plays surely offer variety  he says  “They tend to deal with relationships in families  there’s some social satire  there’s one or two plays which address homosexuality  which tends to be controversial in the African American market  One or two lean toward science fiction or fantasy ”Talking to other young black playwrights as the first festival took shape  Girod found that they shared an anger at being expected to “follow in the tradition of these icons of black theater  like August Wilson and Amiri Baraka and Lorraine Hansberry  and that what we were actually generating did not reflect that life ”In New York  she notes  students and other young actors resist the traditional focus on African American struggles  “It’s almost as if the pendulum has swung ” she says  “They’re like  ‘We want to do plays about being nerds ’ or ‘We want to do sci fi plays ’ or ‘We want to do hipster based plays ’ And our whole mantra is that there’s space for all of that ”Bustin describes a thriving black theater scene around Boston  The companies “definitely fly under the radar  like most fringe theater companies  but there is a scene  and I’m just trying to enhance and enliven that scene ” he says Issues of race and expectation still play out in different and complicated ways  Bustin notes that he’s heard from “playwrights around Boston who are reluctant to be presented at Hibernian Hall because they feel it would be limiting in the way they are perceived ” he says  “They don’t want to be the African American playwright from Roxbury  They’re trying to get downtown ”

of OneUnited Bank His bank has weathered scandals  a government bailout  and  most recently  a costly legal battle with a famous black church  What brought him to the phone on Wednesday was an embarrassing report card from regulators  saying the nation’s largest bank owned by African Americans received a “Needs to Improve” rating for its paltry community lending in Boston and Miami over the past three years  t n“We do not think the report is fair or accurate ’’ Cohee said in an interview from Los Angeles  where the bank now does most of its business  far from its Boston roots and headquarters  “We clearly believe it’s an inappropriate conclusion given the loans made by the bank in minority communities ”In fact  this is the second straight “Needs to Improve” rating for a $612 million institution that has reaped more headlines for its problems than for lending in low  and moderate income neighborhoods in recent years  The newly released report by state and federal banking regulators evaluates OneUnited’s performance under the Community Reinvestment Act  a law that requires all banks to make loans in the neighborhoods where they accept deposits  including to people with modest incomes “Overall  the bank’s lending activities are less than reasonable ’’ the report concluded  While OneUnited has grown its operations in the Los Angeles area  regulators from the Massachusetts Division of Banks and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp  said there has been “minimal lending activity” in Boston  They also cited a lack of lending in the Miami market that amounted to “Substantial Noncompliance ” OneUnited has made or purchased just 34 loans in Massachusetts in three years  according to the report  Of those  26 took place in Suffolk County  where the bank operates three offices  In 2013  the bank expanded lending and refinancing for mostly multifamily properties in Los Angeles  issuing 78 loans  But it made just eight loans in Boston and three in Miami Nationally  only nine of the bank’s loans last year were made to low  or moderate income borrowers Kenneth H  Thomas  a Community Reinvestment Act specialist in Miami  said  “The whole concept of why we have CRA is you put money back in the communities you take the deposits out of — you recycle it back in  You have a bank here that’s doing just the opposite ”Cohee said minority owned banks should not be measured the same way a large bank is judged on community lending  OneUnited says 65 percent of its loan portfolio is in minority or moderate  to low income neighborhoods Loans in such areas  “while appropriate to support the economic development of these communities ’’ Cohee said  “have unique  riskier profiles ”A case in point  he said  was the bank’s $4 million construction loan to the Charles Street African Methodist Episcopal Church in 2007  to build a Roxbury community center  When Charles Street couldn’t repay the money  after several extensions  the bank planned to auction off the main church building There was a huge public outcry  from members of a congregation founded by abolitionists to politicians and academics who offered to mediate  But Cohee wouldn’t budge  Indeed  he did not even answer the calls of city councilors or Harvard law Professor Charles Ogletree The church filed for bankruptcy protection in March 2012 and the case is still not resolved  OneUnited Bank has spent more than $2 8 million in legal fees  according to a court filing “The Charles Street loan is a real setback to the minority community ’’ Cohee said in his first public remarks on a high profile case that had his wife  OneUnited president Teri Williams  in court for many hours over the past two years “If Charles Street is able to evade its debt  that’s going to have a chilling effect for a long time on the ability of churches and other nonprofits’’ to obtain loans  Cohee said  He blamed what he called the interference of church advisers from the Boston equity firm Bain Capital for trying to broker a settlement he found offensively low “Misguided members of the community becoming involved in this have resulted in literally millions of dollars in legal fees ’’ he said  And Cohee shows no sign of wanting to wrap up the fight  A judge is holding $3 million raised in the sale of the church’s unfinished community center  and other properties  until all the legal proceedings are completed “I’m always optimistic we can settle ” said Ross Martin  a lawyer who represents the church  “But three times outside parties have tried to help settle the case  And it hasn’t worked ”The bank has grown by 18 percent since 2010  despite a host of problems When OneUnited lost money on mortgage agency investments in 2008  Cohee landed a $12 million bailout from the government’s Troubled Asset Relief Program  The bank is the only one in Massachusetts that has not repaid the funds “We don’t owe anybody anything ’’ Cohee said  “The Treasury is a shareholder just like I’m a shareholder ”The capital infusion sparked an ethics investigation of California Representative Maxine Waters  whose staffer allegedly helped OneUnited land a meeting with US Treasury officials that led to the funding  Waters has been cleared of any wrongdoing Amid scrutiny of the bank’s TARP funding  details emerged of OneUnited’s poor financial condition  as well as bank funded luxury cars and a Santa Monica mansion that regulators forced OneUnited to sell Lately  Cohee said  he has talked to regulators about changing the way they judge minority owned banks  “The bank

from Cape Verde  and a giddy couple from Nigeria who later twirled outside with joy “We are citizens of the United States ” exulted Ted Onuoha  33  looking to the sky earlier this month as his wife  Uchenna  35  shivered next to him  nOn the hard road to US citizenship  black immigrants are increasingly gaining ground in Massachusetts and the United States  expanding the possibilities for political power and changing  what it means to be black in America  Though still small  the number of new black citizens in Massachusetts has more than doubled  to 76 000 since 2000  census estimates show  fueled by transplants from the Caribbean and  increasingly  fast growing groups from Africa  Nationwide  the number of new black citizens has nearly doubled  to 1 8 million Rising black immigration is rapidly reshaping Massachusetts  where the black community is already one of the most diverse in the nation  A third of the roughly 470 000 black people in Massachusetts are immigrants  compared with nearly 9 percent nationwide  nBirth rates mirror the shift  For the first time in Massachusetts history  a majority of black babies born since 2008 have an immigrant mother  according to the figures from the state Department of Public Health  The single largest group of mothers of black children  since 2006  have been from Africa “It’s not just Jamaicans  Trinidadians and Tobagans  and Panamanians anymore ” said James Jennings  professor of urban studies and planning at Tufts University Though becoming a citizen gives them the right to vote  many immigrants said the surge toward citizenship is more personal than political  US citizens can bring relatives to America faster  qualify for more scholarships and financial aid  and are protected from deportation  For many  US citizenship is a point of pride “We love to become citizens of this great country ” said Grace Anderson  an immigrant from Ghana who lives in Roslindale and plans to apply for citizenship when she becomes eligible  “It’s prestigious to us to be a citizen  It’s one thing that’s on every African’s mind ”At the citizenship ceremony in Faneuil Hall  some immigrants said they had put off becoming a citizen  while others said they had applied as soon as they legally could  Legal immigrants do not have to apply for citizenship  but in general  immigrants cannot apply until they have been legal permanent residents for five years Marie Rose Antoine  65  a nurse’s aide from Boston  said her husband had pressed her to apply as they got older  Pedro DaCruz  27  a National Guardsman from Cape Verde who lives in Brockton  had also been here for years  but applied after serving in Afghanistan  nHenok Terefe  a 28 year old accountant from Ethiopia  said he applied as soon as he was eligible  because he just wanted “to be part of it ”“Right away ” Terefe said  “That’s what I wanted ”Compared with Asians and Latin Americans  black immigrants are still a relatively small group  accounting for less than 10 percent of 40  million immigrants nationwide and  15 percent of nearly 1 million foreign born residents in Massachusetts Haitians are the single largest group of black immigrants  with long roots in the Bay State  and other Caribbean immigrants include Jamaicans and Trinidadians  Another large group are Cape Verdeans  who come from an island off West Africa with long ties to Massachusetts  Newer African immigrants are from Ghana  Kenya  and Nigeria   nThey are coming for work or study  to reunite with family  or as refugees fleeing famine and war  Researchers say one major pipeline for black immigrants over the past two decades is the federal visa lottery  which grants green cards to people from countries that historically did not have a significant presence in the United States  Since the program began in the 1990s  African immigrants have soared from a relatively small group  40 percent of whom were white  to more than 1 million people  74 percent of whom are black  nThe shift marks the first large influx of black people from Africa since the forced migration of slavery  according to the Migration Policy Institute  a Washington based think tank  But that could change if Congress dismantles the visa lottery  as lawmakers are considering in various forms of immigration legislation   nBlack Africans are a smaller immigrant group than black Caribbeans  but researchers say that could change An analysis by the Institute for Immigration Research at George Mason University for the Globe shows the smaller group of African immigrants is growing faster and members are quickly becoming citizens Almost 45 percent of black Africans in Massachusetts were naturalized US citizens  according to census estimates in 2012  up from just 23 6 percent in 2000  More than half of black Caribbeans in Massachusetts were citizens  up from 44 1 percent in 2000 “It’s a dramatic increase ” said James Witte  director of the institute  “We’re seeing it with both  but particularly with Africans  This is happening not only in Massachusetts  but across the country ”How black citizens  native and foreign born  will change Massachusetts in the future is an open question Some say the growing black immigrant population could be a voting bloc on its own or could join with African Americans  In Boston  black people overall are the second largest population  more numerous than Latinos and more than double the size of the Asian population  Last year  some black leaders were disappointed that black candidates for mayor came up short behind Mayor Martin J  Walsh  the son of Irish immigrants At the citizenship ceremony  Terrion Lewis Francis  41 and from Jamaica  said it was hard to imagine the different groups of black people banding together in Massachusetts “They can try ” said Lewis Francis  a substitute teacher who also works at a pharmacy in Norwood  “But it’s going to take a lot of work to get everyone as one ” nAnd some immigrants reject the term “African American” because they say it obscures their identities and particular needs  such as the hundreds of Cape Verdeans on waiting lists for English classes because they speak Portuguese or creole  n“I identify myself racewise as a black man  but as far as my ethnicity is concerned  I’m not African American  I’m Cape Verdean ” said Moises Rodrigues  who last year became the first Cape Verdean elected to the Brockton City Council Others say greater unity help in confronting problems that disproportionately affect black people  such as lower incomes and higher unemployment rates  n“I certainly don’t have a crystal ball  and I can’t tell you how long it will take ” said Barbara Lewis  director of the William Monroe Trotter Institute for the Study of Black History and Culture at the University of Massachusetts Boston  “There will come a point where  the black community  will recognize that it is to mutual advantage to politically coalesce — and also economic advantage ”Although black people are a diverse mix of professionals  laborers  wealthy and poor  no economic classes are immune to racism “The visceral experiences are a lot similar ” said Kevin J A  Thomas  a sociology professor at Pennsylvania State University who researched black immigration for the Migration Policy Institute  “No matter how distinct you think you are from African Americans  when you apply for a job  what people see on the outside is the color of your skin ”In Massachusetts  at least two new groups have emerged to try to unite Africans and other black immigrants and Americans along common goals Voury Ignegongba  an immigrant from Chad  created Africans in Boston in 2011 to bring together a broader group of Africans  African Americans  and friends  In recent weeks  they chatted about black history over mango juice in an Ethiopian restaurant in the South End  attended an art exhibit in Roxbury  and networked over sushi in Cambridge The goal  he said  is to create networks where information can flow  whether it is job opportunities  education  or cultural events  More than 4 000 people are on their mailing list “Each community tends to be in their own little corner trying to get politicians to deal with the issues ” he said  “It would make more sense and the message would be more powerful if it’s coming from a bigger group ”A second group  the African Council  was created in 2010 to assemble the various African immigrant groups to support Governor Deval Patrick’s bid for reelection  More than 600 people showed up to a town hall meeting to meet the governor  The organization continues to grow “To me the idea that we can organize even a fraction of that community  even if it was like 10 000 voters  that’s powerful ” said one of the founders  Georgina Wanja Kariuki  a young immigrant from Kenya Kariuki said getting immigrants involved in politics is challenging  because many are still deeply connected to their homelands  Some build schools back home  send money to relatives  or are working multiple jobs to save enough money to bring relatives to America  Many rely on their national networks to navigate their way in the United States On a recent Saturday night  hundreds of members of the Ghana Association of Greater Boston poured into the Sons of Italy Lodge in Watertown  to celebrate Ghana’s 57th independence day  They sang their national anthem — and the Star Spangled Banner — dined on homemade goat stew  and smiled proudly as children sang Ghanaian songs  though some had to be pried away from video games to do it Organizers estimated that many  if not most  of the group are highly educated US citizens  thrilled to be in the United States  But many also want their children to know what it means to be from Ghana “It’s important that they know about it and maintain that culture ” said Kobena Bonney   nassociation president  “There’s something special about having that connection with your folks  ways of living  and the tradition of respect ” nIn Roxbury Crossing  Abdillahi Abdirahman  is trying to do just that from Butterfly Coffee  the hub of the Somali community  and now other Africans in Boston  He is also constantly prodding immigrants to get involved in state and local politics  Many turn out to vote  but some resist Many need his help with more urgent tasks  Some need help with tax returns  A Somali woman in Maine cannot figure out the immigration system  For his work  some jokingly call Abdirahman “the mayor ”But he knows the difference a real mayor can make  Mayor Thomas M  Menino helped clear the way for his cafe and for the soaring mosque across the street  Abdirahman wants the city to hire more Somalis He compares Somalis to the Irish who battled severe discrimination in Boston in the 1800s  They seized power through politics and eventually seemed to dominate the police and fire departments  and elected offices  He likes to quote the Speaker Tip O’Neill   n“Remember ”

young people here ” Gross said  “Do you see any cars burning  Do you see any broken windows  No ”The crowd was dispersing by about 12 30 a m  Gross said he had no plans to break up the protest during the night if it continued “I’m the chief of police  I wholeheartedly support their right to protest  their First Amendment rights ” he said  adding later  “Imagine  from South Bay to here  and there are no cars burning  no businesses looted  This is great ”Throughout the night  a sense that Boston must find an opportunity to grow stronger from the Ferguson tragedy rang through the protests and an emotional community meeting  held at a Roxbury church Tuesday evening  The protest began gathering momentum outside a nearby police station even before the meeting at the church wound down The rally in Roxbury  including a candle lighting and 4½ minutes of silence for Brown  was organized by Black Lives Matter Boston  a grass roots advocacy group that formed after Brown was killed “The state has sanctioned violence against black people ” Daunasia Yancey  lead organizer of Black Lives Matter Boston  told the crowd  “We can choose to be complicit in the system  Or we can choose to make a difference ”Then they were off  With a profane antipolice anthem ringing from a truck’s speakers  protesters marched to South Bay House of Correction in solidarity with inmates there  At South Bay  inmates banged on windows in response as the crowd cheered  banged drums  and shut down the busy Massachusetts Avenue Connector under the watchful eye of Boston police officers Some drivers blocked by protesters pulled over and joined the march  said protester Samaria Johnson  32  of Roxbury “I’m really surprised to see the level of diversity out here  black  white  gay  straight  Indian  Somalian ” she said More than 100 State Police  Boston police  and Transit Police officers — some clad in helmets and protective gear — met the marchers there  in what a State Police spokesman said was an effort to keep them off the interstate Protesters chanted “hands up  don’t shoot” — a rallying cry in the wake of Brown’s death “There are a lot of things messed up with the system ” said Fatuma Mohamed  19  a student from South Boston High School  She said she went to the march and rally “to stand in solidarity with the people of Ferguson ”The people of Boston face many of the same issues  said many who packed the pews at Twelfth Baptist Church in Roxbury earlier Tuesday night  But the ensuing conversation  some said  could leave Boston stronger “Sometimes that conversation won’t make us feel comfortable because there are some uncomfortable issues that we have to talk about ” said the Rev  Jeffrey Brown  speaking at an emotional forum at Twelfth Baptist  where Martin Luther King Jr  once preached “You don’t have to say ‘amen ’ ” Brown said  “I know I’m right ”At the forum  Mayor Martin J  Walsh and Governor elect Charlie Baker delivered brief addresses before ceding the microphone to others in the crowd Residents at the meeting urged better training for city police officers in community matters  the resumption of a civilian review board to oversee complaints against police  a conversation on race  and something as personal and basic as returning to the roots of the Bible “What we need to do is clean house  Any good cop is all about expelling the bad cops  So let’s pull up the weed by the roots ’’ said Jamarhl Crawford  who runs the Blackstonian online community newspaper and drew the loudest applause Jumaane Kendrick  28  of Roxbury  urged Bostonians to get involved to lift the downtrodden from hopelessness  He said he had been in gangs when he was younger  afraid to share with his parents the dangers of the streets  But he was able to get out of it through the persistence of others who stood by him On Tuesday  he urged others to do the same in their communities As dozens watched on a video feed downstairs  Walsh and Baker said they came to the meeting to listen  learn  and comfort those still raging “One thing missing from Ferguson is the opportunity for people to grieve ’’ Walsh said  “I want to ensure the people of Boston feel safe and secure  and that we are respectful in addressing our feelings ”He acknowledged that Boston is not immune from the seemingly intractable problems that afflict towns like Ferguson — racial disparities in education  income  and much more  distrust of police  Boston  he said  cannot change the rest of the country — but it can do better “Let’s be leaders ” Walsh said In Dewey Square  Latoya Sanderson  a Dorchester native who now lives in California but is home for Thanksgiving  said she had participated in a protest in Ferguson during a cross country car ride in August but did not expect to see anything of this scale in her hometown “No black child should die ” she said  “I just want to hear police answer that one question that we’ve been asking since August ”She said she believed the protest would send a message to city officials “They are going to look back on this night and say we can never let this happen again in Boston ” she said  “I think the city is going to be talking ”

charges against a white police officer who fatally shot an unarmed black teenager in Ferguson  Mo   in August  At the same time  more than 200 protesters rallied at City Hall plaza and marched on to the State House But some officials and community leaders who spoke to the Globe after the ruling was announced also expressed hope that the decision would spark a conversation about racial inequality in Boston and beyond  t n“I think  the ruling is  another example of our criminal justice system not working for people of color ” Michael Curry  president of the Boston branch of the NAACP  said in a phone interview  “What this says to me is that we have to continue to push the message that black lives matter  and that even bad cops  or police officers who use bad judgment  should be held accountable ”Curry spoke to the Globe moments after St  Louis County Prosecutor Robert McCulloch told reporters that a grand jury chose not to indict Officer Darren Wilson in the Aug  9 shooting death of Michael Brown  18 “We should all be shocked and disappointed that nine of 12 people couldn’t meet the very low threshold to find probable cause” to bring charges against Wilson  Curry said Outside City Hall  the large group of demonstrators formed a silent circle to remember Brown  and then took the protest to the State House  where they blocked Beacon Street Shanae Burch  23  was among the first to arrive at City Hall  She said one of the chants — “black lives matter” — struck a false note “As a black woman I don’t like this chant ” she said  “Black lives matter  Humans matter  I don’t want to come across as the quote unquote angry black woman  But I am angry  I’ve lived here for six years  People are dying because of the color of their skin ”Sandy Lopes  22  a Simmons College student from Dorchester who helped organize the event  said she was disgusted when she learned that Wilson would not be charged “It’s sad that a student of color still has to deal with this 50 years after the civil rights movement ” she said Standing in front of a row state troopers outside the State House  the demonstrators raised their hands and chanted  “Hands up  don’t shoot ”No arrests associated with the protest were reported Councilor Tito Jackson  whose district includes Roxbury and parts of Dorchester  also had strong words for the grand jury “I think the grand jury got it absolutely wrong ” Jackson said in an interview  “Sadly  this young man  who should be sitting at his Thanksgiving table with his family in a couple of days  will not be with his family  This is a miscarriage of justice ”Attempts to reach the Massachusetts Chiefs of Police Association and a spokesman for the State Police Association of Massachusetts for comment on the ruling were unsuccessful Monday night Several officials offered their condolences to Brown’s relatives  including Governor Deval Patrick  nPatrick said in a statement that the Brown family is “having to experience their loss afresh  I am thinking tonight of the people of Ferguson  of their police officers  and of the apparent lack of understanding between the two — and I pray for peace ”Governor elect Charlie Baker said he respects the grand jury process and also offered condolences “They are ones who lost a child and there is no remedy for that loss ” Baker said in a statement  “In addition  my thoughts are with the residents of Ferguson who have lived through these tragic events ”Other advocates described their reactions as the grand jury’s ruling was made public “My immediate reaction was sadness ” said Daunasia Yancey  lead organizer of Black Lives Matter Boston  “I think what I heard sounded to me like a defense attorney  It didn’t sound like what I’d expect from a prosecutor ”She said Black Lives Matter decided to postpone its rally until Tuesday because it was not clear until late Monday when the announcement would come  and to give organizers and others a chance to process what had happened The rally will be held at 7 p m  Tuesday outside a Boston police station in Roxbury The Rev  Gregory G  Groover Sr   pastor of Charles Street A M E  Church in Roxbury and a former Boston School Committee chairman  said the ruling reflects the nation’s continued struggles with race relations  despite the election of the first black president “This represents the reality that our country has not had a mature discussion about race  and we need to deal with racism ” he said  “This is racism at its most blatant form ”Bill Owens  a former state senator who represented several Boston neighborhoods  offered a similarly bleak prognosis “I believe that there is a war against black men         young black men ” Owens said  “And I think that something has to be done about it ”Mayor Martin J  Walsh called for peace in Boston  saying in a statement that officials are expecting demonstrations and “we welcome these expressions  done respectfully  responsibly  and peacefully ”He also invited residents to join him and the Rev  Jeffrey Brown at Twelfth Baptist Church in Roxbury at 6 p m  Tuesday for a public forum on the ruling Curry  the local NAACP president  remained hopeful that some good would come after the grand jury’s ruling “I think for folks here in Roxbury  Dorchester  Mattapan  Greater Boston  our hope is that we’ll turn this disappointment and disgust with this

perhaps change your travel plans — once you’ve taken a gander at the warring clans populating Boston area stages  which are rife with cautionary tales about all the things that can go wrong when people related to one another are gathered under one roof  As we approach the holiday season  the overall picture onstage is less Norman Rockwell than “The Sopranos ’’ where every drumstick comes with a side dish of agita  t nFamily strife abounds in productions ranging from SpeakEasy Stage Company’s “ ’’ in which a pair of cousins pull out all the stops in a ferocious battle over a precious heirloom left by their grandfather  to Boston Playwrights’ Theatre’s “ ’’ a grim tale of a wayward mother and the embittered daughter she left behind  to Huntington Theatre Company’s “ ’’ where young Ralph sums up his own fractious home and the wider world thus  “I see every house lousy with lies and hate ’’Ouch  Though Clifford Odets’s drama premiered in 1935  Ralph could be describing a typical floor debate in our current Congress  or one of the countless campaign attack ads that consumed the airwaves until recently  or a segment from one of the partisan shriekfests on talk radio or cable TV  Nonstop rancor is the defining characteristic of political dialogue in our deeply polarized Red State vs  Blue State era  With apologies to the late Tip O’Neill  all politics is  — and the volume is invariably cranked way up high nowadays  So the quarrelsome kinfolk in these stage productions provide a cracked mirror reflection of our divided national family This time of year can be especially conducive to familial friction  a reality underscored in “Two Boys Lost ’’ a superb new drama by Medford playwright Bill Doncaster that largely takes place around Christmas time  The Molineaux household is suffused with a decidedly unfestive  scorpions in a bottle atmosphere as family members battle for the last word in disputes over the fate of the brother and son long racked by severe mental illness  Tensions are so high and personal histories are so fraught in “Two Boys Lost ’’ which premiered last month in Cambridge  that they can be inflamed by seemingly trivial matters In one scene  Ma chastises her adult daughter  Julie  for not purchasing a spinach calzone  even though Julie had bought several other varieties of calzone and had waited in line for half an hour to do so  “Is this the thing this year ’’ asks an exasperated Julie  Replies Ma  “What ‘thing’ ’’ Julie  “The ‘thing’ that ruins Christmas  Every year you pick something — Is this it ’’On balance  the playwrights behind discord driven dramas would seem to agree with Leo Tolstoy’s famous formulation  from “Anna Karenina ’’ that  “All happy families are alike  each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way ’’ And who knows  the audience might also concur  hungry as they seem to be for tales of messed up households  to judge by the secure place on bestseller lists often enjoyed by dysfunctional family memoirs  Indeed  playwright Monica Bauer makes the connection clear in her program note for “Chosen Child ’’ at Boston Playwrights’ Theatre through Nov  22  confiding  “I struggled to write a memoir  and instead of a book  out popped this play ’’Of course  unhappy or troubled families have always served as a reliably juicy ingredient of drama  from the bloody minded House of Atreus in the works of the great Greek tragedians to the bitterly divided Oklahoma clan at the center of Tracy Letts’s 2008 Pulitzer Prize winner  “August  Osage County ’’In Horton Foote’s “The Trip to Bountiful ’’ which begins performances Thursday at ArtsEmerson  the elderly Carrie Watts engages in a contest of wills with her daughter in law  while Carrie’s mild mannered son is caught in the middle in the small Houston apartment where the three of them live  In Tom Stoppard’s “The Real Thing ’’ at Bad Habit Productions through Nov  23  a married playwright and a married actress have an affair  leave their respective spouses  and tie the knot themselves  only to have their relationship buffeted by another infidelity If you’ve cast your eyes across the area theater landscape lately  you’ve seen a host of classics that were written long before the term “dysfunctional family’’ came into common use  Tennessee Williams’s “The Glass Menagerie’’ was performed recently by Roxbury Repertory Theater  William Shakespeare’s “King Lear ’’ the family feud to end all family feuds  came to ArtsEmerson last month in a production by Shakespeare’s Globe  Henrik Ibsen’s “Hedda Gabler’’ is at Pawtucket  R I ’s Sandra Feinstein Gamm Theatre through Nov  30  starring Boston stalwart Marianna Bassham  who gives a memorable performance as the unhappily married title character Early in the Gamm’s production  the kind hearted but clueless Aunt Juliana  played by another well known Boston actress  Marya Lowry  gazes around the spare abode that Hedda shares with her husband  George  and says  “Now I will leave you two lovebirds alone to enjoy breakfast in your home  Isn’t that a lovely word  ’’Um  not necessarily  It’s easy to see why playwrights look homeward so often in search of tension  which equals conflict  which in turn equals drama  After all  the first  and often most life shaping  relationships we have are with our families  so the stakes are high from the get go   A portrait of Hedda’s forbidding father looms over her parlor in the Gamm production   The Boston born playwright Sarah Treem  whose “The How and the Why’’ pits a mother and daughter against each other in a clash over scientific ideas and personal identity  has said that one way for a writer to build dramatic tension is to put “people in a room who have very good reasons to be furious at each other and you don’t let them leave ’’That’s a pretty fair description of the families in some Boston area productions  where the family values include deception  spite  small mindedness  abandonment  one upmanship  disloyalty  dream stifling  megalomania  and an appetite for ruthless infighting  Those aren’t traits that make for pleasant company in any traditional sense  but stage depictions of hostile homefronts might resonate with today’s audiences in part because they register as an indirect echo of the recent economic earthquake known as the Great Recession  Let’s face it  dry statistics tell only a tiny part of the story of any major economic downturn  The fuller  truer story is always to be found in individual homes  where lives are turned upside down by the stress and interpersonal friction brought on by financial worries  Nobody is on their best behavior when money is tight Clifford Odets knew this  The pervasive anxiety of the Great Depression runs through  his “Awake and Sing  ’’ shaping and distorting the decisions made by the Berger family  especially the matriarch  Bessie  “Times is getting worse ’’ says Bessie as the play approaches its climax  “Prospect Avenue  Dawson  Beck Street — every day furniture’s on the sidewalk         H ere without a dollar you don’t look the world in the eye  Talk from now to next year — this is life in America ’’Regardless of the state of the US economy  a dramatist’s job is to represent the truth of human experience  and family tension is one of those eternal truths  Surely it’s no coincidence that most of the best known plays in the history of American theater have revolved around troubled families  Eugene O’Neill’s “Long Day’s Journey Into Night ’’ Arthur Miller’s “Death of a Salesman’’  speaking of money worries   and Williams’s triptych of domestic anguish  “The Glass Menagerie ’’ “A Streetcar Named Desire ’’ and “Cat on a Hot Tin Roof ’’In “Long Day’s Journey Into Night ’’ the four Tyrones — father James  mother Mary  and sons Jamie and Edmund — are based on O’Neill’s own family  In “The Glass Menagerie ’’ Williams’s “memory play ’’ Amanda Wingfield and her two children  Laura and Tom  are modeled on the playwright’s mother  his sister  and himself  By turning their tormented families into a subject of drama  Williams and O’Neill sought to understand and maybe exorcise their families and their past  They also  in a way  gained creative control over their own stories  Sometimes a dysfunctional family brings out the worst in a person  and sometimes it brings out the writer John Lahr observes in his splendid new Williams biography  “Tennessee Williams  Mad Pilgrimage of the Flesh ’’ that the playwright’s family “was never far from his mind ’’“Williams’s romance with the theater allowed him to get his insides out and to act out the warring fragments of family madness to which he had been an understudy all his life ’’ Lahr writes  “To put feelings into the audience and to watch its startled response was also reassuring  it allowed Williams to reenter childhood innocence and to be known for himself as he never was in the family ’’That’s a timeless impulse among playwrights  one that virtually guarantees that family dramas will always maintain a firm grip on the theater  When they wrestle with their own familial ghosts  a kind of closure can sometimes be achieved  as suggested by the moving words O’Neill wrote to his wife  Carlotta  when he gave her the original script of “Long Day’s Journey Into Night ’’In his inscription  O’Neill credited Carlotta with giving him “the faith in love that enabled me to face my dead at last and write this play — write it with deep pity and understanding and forgiveness for  the four haunted Tyrones ’’ n•  n•  n•  n•  n•  n',

thick slate bed  It serves as the centerpiece of the room  which also features walls crammed with memorabilia and a bar with two kegs on tap   nThe billiard table  McCarthy likes to note  was salvaged from an old pool hall that was once located in Codman Square  where his Irish immigrant grandparents made their home  It’s the kind of local history he quaffs like a pint of his beloved Guinness  t

technician in the city  For several years now  McCarthy  47  a father of three  has combined his love of local lore with his talent for drawing  He’s been making a series of oversized  fanatically detailed maps of the city and its neighborhoods at various points over Boston’s past four centuries The product of countless hours of research and design  McCarthy’s maps are more than a mere hobby  “I burn a lot of shoe leather ” he says  visiting various historical societies  state archives  the map center at the Boston Public Library  and other research institutions More than that  though  he makes firsthand surveys of the city’s crooked  story laden streets while on the job as an EMT “I drive my partners crazy ” he says  asking them to turn down side streets and alleyways in the ambulance

the Boston Public Library  “They have a nice design  a nice artistic style  As I remember  they seem to be very accurate ” At the BPL  he says  McCarthy has consulted the state’s collection of Bromley real estate atlases  which are “probably the best source he can get for doing historical research ”It’s safe to say McCarthy has become familiar with the city’s neighborhoods  When he took prints of his first few maps to Thomas O’Connor  the late Boston College professor considered by many the foremost authority on the city’s history  he told O’Connor he’d been inspired by his 2001 book  “The Hub  Boston Past and Present ”“I thought the book needed a map ” he told O’Connor  “It was irking me  so I drew one ”Amused and impressed  O’Connor told McCarthy he was welcome to use any information he could glean from O’Connor’s work In the McCarthy basement on a recent gloomy Saturday afternoon  the self taught cartographer carefully lays his maps on the pool table for a visitor to examine  The core seven feature Boston as it appeared at pivotal times in its history  from its founding in 1630 when it was little more than a  spit of land to its “Cradle of Liberty” period in 1776 to a major US city of 2010 Other maps zoom in on neighborhoods — Jamaica Plain  Roxbury  the “Mother of Towns”   Southie  There are two versions of that one  one with a section about Whitey Bulger and another “Whitey free” edition The wide margins of the color coded maps are dense with insets and tales from the city’s past  Each map is marked by a cartouche of McCarthy’s own design — an emblem he created using clip art  freehand sketches  and a scanned image of one of his mother’s brooches To date  McCarthy has completed 23 maps of his intended 55  He hopes to see them hanging one day in City Hall or in civic buildings  bars  hotels  and “places with waiting rooms ” He says he’s sold about 130 prints so far at $100 a pop  mostly to friends and co workers and by word of mouth  A few have earned places of honor in homes as far away as Florida and Mexico City “We have other historical maps  but these two are definitely my favorites ” says Jason Turgeon  an environmental scientist who blogs

scale of McCarthy’s pastime project  he doesn’t come across as especially obsessive  He does allow that his son sometimes jokes he must be “in the Illuminati ” what with all those meetings he takes to trade arcane information “I’m not obsessing ” says McCarthy  cracking a second can of Guinness  “but it would be nice if it was accurate  I feel the need to get it right  to give it the attention it’s due ”After some initial skepticism over the time his project was taking  his wife threw her support behind it when she realized McCarthy was bringing home some extra cash  “I’m not going to give you  grief  about being on the computer anymore ” she said  laughing  Though he’s still building his website   with the help of his ambulance partner  who is also named Ed   McCarthy says he knew he was onto something from the very beginning  When a co worker wanted to buy a copy of the Southie map  McCarthy put it in a dinged up thrift shop frame  “I fi  it with a Sharpie”  and brought it to Beth Israel  where he’d arranged to meet the man  nHe laid the map on an empty bed in the emergency room and went off to track down the buyer  When he returned  he found a half dozen doctors and nurses oohing and aahing over his map  Two of them asked to buy copies for themselves On the wall overlooking the pool table in his basement hangs an original 1835 reprint of the historic 1722 “Bonner map” of Boston  drawn by Captain John Bonner  A gift from a co worker  it’s the only truly collectible map McCarthy owns  More wall space is devoted to his collection of EMT uniform patches and his wife’s framed Bay City Rollers album covers   There’s a blueprint from the original plans for Fenway Park leaning against the wall near the bar  ready to be hung  “I won that at a raffle  believe it or not ” For McCarthy  Boston’s back story isn’t just a thing of the past “There are drawers at the Boston Public Library with maps from the 1700s and 1800s drawn by hand ” he says  “Two hundred years from now  someone will be going through a dusty drawer and find my stuff  I’m becoming part of the history  in a way ”', '2014_1264')",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Wednesday to face charges of disorderly conduct and disturbing the peace  stemming from a “Black Lives Matter” march the night before that blocked traffic in the city and at one point threatened to surge onto Interstates 90 and 93 Protesting a grand jury’s decision not to charge the police officer in the Ferguson  Mo   fatal shooting  those arrested in Boston ranged in age from 17 to 32 and came from several of the city’s neighborhoods as well as distant corners of New England  They reflected the diversity of a crowd estimated at 1 400 to 1 600 that was made up of blacks  whites  Latinos  and Asians  and both first time protesters and veterans of social activism  t nNearly all had their charges in court reduced to civil infractions akin to parking tickets  minus the fines  Most were bleary eyed from a night in jail  and some bore scrapes and bruises  saying they had been placed in headlocks  punched  or dragged across pavement by Boston officers and State Police Police declined to respond to specific complaints from the protesters about injuries  However  Boston Police Commissioner William Evans expressed pride Wednesday at what he called a “real soft approach” employed by law enforcement in holding the line to block access to the highway by a crowd that was alternately orderly and “rambunctious ”“There was a lot of taunting  a lot of name calling  a lot of pushing and shoving ” Evans told reporters  saying some of his officers recognized protesters from 2011’s Occupy Boston  “We were engaged with the crowd  and as much as they tried to take us to the next level  we were disciplined ”Lead organizer Daunasia Yancey of Black Lives Matter Boston said the protest had been planned days in advance through social media  but that the attempt to march onto I 93 from the Massachusetts Avenue Connector Tuesday evening — and  later  the Massachusetts Turnpike near South Station — was spontaneous Yancey called blocking traffic an attempt to shake up “business as usual” and said the move was partly a reaction to the cheering of inmates in the nearby South Bay House of Correction  who shared the marchers’ anger and frustration over the announcement Monday night that a grand jury declined to charge a Ferguson police officer who shot and killed an unarmed teenager in August “In this country  state violence against black people is the norm  Every 28 hours  a black person is killed by police forces or armed security  and so I think taking the highway was mainly about interrupting a public space ” said Yancey  a 22 year old activist from the South End  who described herself as a distant relative of Boston City Councilor Charles Yancey  “Unfortunately the police were just one step ahead of us ”Yancey  who was not arrested  appeared in Roxbury Municipal Court to support the 21 adults arraigned there Wednesday  Eighteen others faced charges at the central Boston Municipal Court  while two teenagers faced juvenile charges  according to the Suffolk County district attorney’s office Aided by civil liberties lawyers  nearly all had their cases reduced to civil infractions  and only a few were ordered to pay court fees  One protester  26 year old Segun Idowu of Mattapan  refused the offer and insisted on a trial “In my opinion  for me to accept the plea deal would be to acknowledge that the troopers had the right to do what they did  and I don’t believe that ” said Idowu  one of the few who had changed into a pressed suit for his arraignment  Others had not had time to go home after being bailed out and wore rumpled clothes  “Hopefully when I have my day in court  that will come out ”One other man  30 year old Francis D  Brooks III of Randolph  was ineligible to have his charge reduced because of prior convictions for assault and battery  while another  25 year old Antonie McKoy of Dorchester  left court before his name was called for arraignment  McKoy had an extensive record and active warrant out for his arrest already  an additional warrant has been issued  said Jake Wark  a spokesman for District Attorney Daniel F  Conley Yancey’s Black Lives Matter group began advertising a “Turn up for Mike Brown” event on social media three weeks ago  anticipating that no charges would be brought against the officer who shot Brown  an unarmed teenager  They called for people to rally outside the Dudley Square police precinct the night after the grand jury ruling  whenever it came  without advertising that they planned to march from there to South Bay as well  She said she hoped they might get 400 people  similar to a march they held last month to bring their message to Newbury Street’s shopping corridor “We were amazed at the turnout  and we were also amazed at the show of solidarity ” she said Michael McCarthy  a sophomore at Vermont’s Marlboro College  drove down with friends who wanted to make their voices heard in a challenge to the “interlocking power structures” that he said have perpetuated centuries of oppression against people of color  They considered rallies in Burlington  Vt   and Northampton but thought an urban setting was most appropriate He said he moved toward the front of the march after hearing a “white allies move forward” call  locking arms with others beside him  Soon  he said  he heard a woman nearby cry out  “I’m being choked ” When he moved to help her he felt someone yank his hair  he said  He said a police officer pushed him to the ground  where an officer pressed a knee into the back of his head  McCarthy said his forehead was scraped on the pavement  and he sported a raw wound in court over his right eyebrow “I’ve never been involved in anything as confrontational as this ” said McCarthy  who had participated in environmental and gay rights marches  but was not surprised given the theme  “It’s exactly the way I expected it ”David Meredith  a Salem State junior with a black and blue right eye  said he was struck in the face  placed in a headlock  and thrown to the ground  even as he joined others in holding his hands up and calling  “No violence  please  No violence  please ”“We  I think  did a really good thing expressing solidarity with the protesters in Ferguson  expressing solidarity with people who are treated like this all over the world ” said Meredith  a 21 year old from Revere  “It’s unfortunate that it came to this  that I have a black eye

Court  “is almost never at his post ” setting off a controversy that simmered for years  Last November  administrators replaced Johnson as chief justice  setting him on a path to retirement  But in the final six months of his career  court records show  the 65 year old judge appears to have done a disappearing act at a significant cost to the Commonwealth  t nAfter his demotion from chief justice  Johnson took a paid three month leave in January and then appeared in court only a handful of times in the three months after that  But during that stretch of time  he qualified for two raises that boosted his annual salary to nearly $160 000 and his pension by nearly $20 000 a year As a result of the well timed exit  he qualified for a pension of $119 781 a year  though he has elected to take a smaller amount of $97 865 a year to ensure survivor payments for his wife if he dies first  nAnd  despite all of Johnson’s time off in 2014  he still received a payment of $40 200 for unused sick and vacation time when he retired days after the second pay increase took effect  according to the state comptroller   nCourt officials said Johnson used some accumulated sick and vacation time to take an extended leave starting Jan  u20092 and later helped his successor  Roberto Ronquillo Jr   with the transition during the month of April  But they declined to discuss Johnson’s overall work this year or his reasons for retiring five years before mandatory retirement age  “Judges’ decisions about their retirement plans are personal decisions that they make ” said Trial Court Chief Justice Paula M  Carey  who has previously praised Johnson in a statement as someone who “led the Boston Municipal Court through a period of dynamic change ” nHowever  taxpayer watchdogs criticized Johnson’s work this year as a waste of scarce resources “Whatever the rationale in this particular case ” said Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation president Michael Widmer  “it illustrates the all too common problem of stretching the system for personal gain at taxpayers’ expense ” Former Boston Municipal Court Judge Peter Anderson  who said he retired in 2007 because he no longer wanted to work in Johnson’s “dysfunctional” court  said court administrators have long known about Johnson’s shortcomings but did nothing  “The issues of his not showing up for work and his management style have gone on for years ” said Anderson  who accused Johnson of being a no show in a 2007 retirement letter that someone leaked to the media  “There is a real need for the leadership to get some backbone and take on these tough issues           They keep doing this kind of thing over and over again ”Johnson did not return repeated calls for comment placed to his cellphone  adult son  or friends  and he did not answer when a Globe reporter visited his home  Court officials also attempted to reach Johnson on behalf of the Globe  but were unsuccessful   nHowever  a defense lawyer who worked with Johnson in Roxbury before he was named to the bench in 1984 by Governor Michael Dukakis  described him as an “even tempered  very smart  and very fair judge ”John Amabile said that Johnson  a graduate of Tuskegee University and Harvard Law School  is quite formal  and polite  preferring to be known as “Charles” and not “Charley ”“When he got on the bench  he was appreciated by everybody  including people on the prosecution side ” said the lawyer  Amabile  “He treated the police  the prosecution  and the defendants fairly  He wasn’t just a good judge  He was a great judge ” Johnson was named to manage the eight courthouses of the Boston Municipal Court system in 2003 and received a second five year term in 2008 Along the way  he had successes — top court officials selected him to preside over a high profile libel suit pitting Judge Ernest Murphy against the Boston Herald But Johnson came under attack from Anderson and others who said his hands off management style helped slow the wheels of justice  including a backlog of 3 000 cases at the Roxbury branch of the municipal courts in 2011 When Fox 25 reported on the controversy in 2011  Johnson issued a statement  saying  “I am dedicated to my office and all of my energy is consistently focused on the effective administration of the Boston Municipal Court department ”Chief Justice Carey replaced Johnson on Nov  15  2013  with Ronquillo  who had been in the East Boston court  That cleared the way for Johnson either to retire or return to presiding over cases instead of managing the courts But Johnson took what court officials called an “accrued leave” on Jan  2  2014  time off that can be taken for medical or personal reasons  though the court disclosed  no reason for Johnson’s leave  He remained on leave until the end of March Then  according to trial court officials  Ronquillo asked Johnson to help him with the transition to running the court system which  by then  had already been underway for four months For the last two months of Johnson’s tenure  Ronquillo assigned Johnson to hear cases every day at the downtown branch of the court  but records of judicial hearings show Johnson appeared on the bench on only a handful of days in May  In fact  when Johnson showed up in court on May 14  lawyers and others in the courtroom seemed surprised  according to a recording of the session  “Yeah  I thought I’d just pop in and see what’s going on ” said Johnson  according to the recording   On at least two occasions he was in court  Johnson heard motions to suppress evidence  but left the cases hanging until the litigants complained that the decision was taking so long  In one of the cases  Johnson finally filed a hand scrawled decision July 11 siding with the defendant  But prosecutors have argued that it should be disregarded because it came after Johnson retired  Johnson’s long run up to retirement proved profitable  allowing him to collect $80 504 in salary for the first six months of the year  according to the comptroller In addition  he received $40 200 in payments for unused vacation and sick time Perhaps the biggest benefit to Johnson was the increase in his pension from receiving two pay raises totaling $30 000  Under the pension rules  a judge receives 75 percent of his highest salary — $159 694  in Johnson’s case — which would entitle him to a maximum benefit of $119 771  Had he retired before the raises  Johnson would be eligible for only $101 343   nBut Johnson agreed to take a smaller amount in his pension  $97 865 a year  so that his wife could continue to receive it after his death  Johnson is not the only judge to step down with an increased pension in the wake of the pay raises — 31 filed for retirement this year  including 11 in July alone  But Johnson’s work record during the past six months before the pay increases  make his case more controversial Widmer of the taxpayers foundation called it “one more blow to public trust in government ”', '2014_744')",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

276,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"('Shortly after dusk on a fall evening in 1993  a group of local Muslim students came together on the pale blue carpet in MIT’s Muslim prayer room to discuss a recent fund raiser they had held on behalf of the beleaguered Muslims in the Bosnian war  The students were discussing further relief efforts when a petite woman among them spoke up and shocked them into silence Instead of collecting food and clothing for their fellow Muslims  she declared  they should give them guns to repel the Serb aggressors  When another student half jokingly declared he did not want to wind up on the FBI’s Most Wanted list  the woman leapt to her feet  t n“She raised her skinny little wrists in the air and said  ‘I’d be proud to be on the Most Wanted list because it would mean I’m doing something to help our Muslim brothers and sisters ’ u200a” recalled Waqas Jilani  then a graduate student at Clark University  “She said we should all be proud to be on that list ”Her name was Aafia Siddiqui  then a studious 21 year old biology major  Eleven years later  she not only made it on to the FBI’s list  possibly the lone female at Al Qaeda’s highest echelon  but was dubbed by US officials as the “most wanted woman in the world” before she was convicted in 2010 of the attempted murder of American agents  Siddiqui’s name resurfaced this fall when the Islamic State of Syria and Iraq group   thus elevating the Brandeis trained neuroscientist to iconic status in the radical Islam world  where she has long been regarded as a martyr In a letter to the family of journalist James Foley  Islamic State militants declared that they had offered prisoner exchanges “to free the Muslims currently in your detention like our sister Dr  Aafia Siddiqui ” but they executed Foley when the US government did not act  Her supporters believe that Siddiqui  serving an 86 year prison sentence in Texas  was framed by the US government  nAs law enforcement officials work to diminish the allure that the Islamic State is proving to have for some young Americans far removed from the fight  Siddiqui’s turbulent decade in Boston offers a crucial window upon the process of radicalization  The story of her 2008 arrest in Afghanistan and the celebrated trial that followed has been told many times  but the details of her transformation from a pious schoolgirl in saffron silk hijab into a querulous jihadi clad in dark abaya have not been fully examined or understood It was a personal migration witnessed by few  Siddiqui formed few close relationships with her classmates at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology  and she shared her evolving political views with only a handful of Muslim students  When she decided to learn how to shoot in hopes of joining the jihad overseas  she enrolled in a class at a Braintree gun club by herself  Not long after her arrival in Boston  she became a regular at the Islamic Society of Boston’s newly opened Prospect Street mosque  which would later become a favorite of another alleged jihadi of future renown named Tamerlan Tsarnaev  nBy the latter part of the 1990s  Siddiqui’s devotion had turned into a spiritual rage against those she considered hostile to her faith  Then married with children  she worked closely with activists later linked to Osama bin Laden’s organization  and she was a passionate speaker at local mosques and schools  At Brandeis University  where she earned a doctorate  she was repeatedly admonished for introducing the Koran in the classroom  At home in their Roxbury apartment  she begged her husband  a resident in anesthesiology at Brigham and Women’s Hospital  to leave his work to accompany her to Bosnia or Afghanistan But what led Siddiqui  a highly intelligent woman who was from a prominent Pakistani family and whose options seemed limitless  to ultimately take up arms on behalf of Al Qaeda  as the FBI says she did  is something some experts and investigators still want to know  Siddiqui  42  declined through an administrator at the federal prison in Fort Worth to be interviewed “It would be useful to know why Aafia did what she did ” said Evan Kohlmann  an international terrorism consultant with Flashpoint Global Partners  a private security firm  “She does not fit into any of the stereotypes of an extremist  Was she radicalized by sociopolitical factors or something more personal  What was it ”The answer lies partly in the gradual unfolding of her radical inclination during her Boston years and partly in something she arrived here with — a passionate understanding of what it means to be a Muslim woman  Two days before she arrived in Cambridge in the fall of 1991  Siddiqui gave an impassioned speech to a roomful of Muslim students in Houston on that very subject  Siddiqui  who had spent the previous year studying at the University of Houston while living with her brother  was as adamant as she was engaging  Captured on video  wisps of her long brown hair slip from her yellow hijab and her almond eyes flash with fervor “The hijab is not a restriction  It allows a woman to be judged by her content  not by her packaging  by what is written on the pages  not the pretty artwork on the cover ” she declared  “Islam does not see the woman as a prize cow to be paraded before the world ” nThey called it the Wheel of Fortune A handful of MIT’s Muslim students had built the 3 foot wide wooden wheel and mounted it on a spinner pegged to questions about the five pillars of Islam  Who were the prophets of Islam  In what direction do Muslims face when they pray  The wheel was placed on a table outside the student center and students took turns inviting passersby to play  No one loved the game more than Siddiqui “She was like  ‘This is how we are going to get people to learn about the faith  by making it fun ’ u200a” Jilani said It was a lesson she had learned well during a childhood in Zambia and Pakistan  Her father  a prosperous neurosurgeon  was a devout man  But it was her mother  a scholar of Islam and an advocate for the poor  who directed her three children to commit themselves to the good of the “ummah ’’ an Arabic word meaning community  Siddiqui and her siblings memorized large portions of the Koran and often helped out with their mother’s relief operation Siddiqui  by her family’s account  was a gentle child who cultivated a small zoo of pets including rabbits and cats  She was also highly intelligent  and by the time she was in her late teens  her parents made the somewhat unusual decision to send her to college in the United States  on her own  She spent one year in Houston  eschewing the usual student pastimes of drinking and dating  before MIT offered her a partial scholarship “We were all thrilled ” said her sister Fowzia Siddiqui  a neurologist living in Karachi  Pakistan On her arrival at MIT  Siddiqui took up residence at her request in the all female McCormick Hall dormitory  She promptly immersed herself in the study of biology  Dressed in her hijab and conservative long sleeves as she bustled across campus  she was regarded by her dormmates as reserved but driven “She was very sweet ” recalled a McCormick resident who asked not to be identified  “But if you talked to her about something not up her alley  she just smiled and did not argue  You could tell she was not hearing you ” nHer more determined side surfaced rarely and then primarily when matters of faith were at stake  Although grateful for the scholarship money she received from MIT  she tangled repeatedly with the university  concerned that she might violate Islam’s restrictions on loans “She was always battling with the bursar’s office about the loan thing ” recalled the dormmate  MIT declined to address questions about Siddiqui The focus of Siddiqui’s social and spiritual life at MIT was the Muslim Student Association  a group of about a hundred students  some of whom met in the school’s prayer room  or “musalla ” Siddiqui plunged into the group’s activities  regularly hosting an information  or “dawah ” table about Islam and writing leaflets on the faith  Impressed by Siddiqui’s zeal and her encyclopedic knowledge of the Koran  the association’s leaders chose her to serve as secretary of the group “When I knew her  and I knew her pretty well  she was very gentle and had no political agenda ” recalled Arif Khalid  former president of the association and now an engineer in Ohio  “She just cared about being a good person and explaining the religion to others ” nIn her sophomore year  Siddiqui won a $5 000 grant  the Carroll L  Wilson Award  for a research project on “Islamization in Pakistan and its Effects on Women” that took her back to her home country  Her return to Cambridge coincided with a radical shift in the focus of the global Muslim community  her focus shifted with it  With the conflict in Afghanistan fading from center stage after the Russian forces retreated  the civil war in Bosnia and its brutal ethnic infighting came to dominate the headlines  Reports of ongoing mass rape and murder of Muslim citizens at the hands of Serb nationalists riveted Muslims around the world  As the terrorism consultant Kohlmann puts it  “Bosnia was a wake up call to Muslims in the West  If it could happen in Europe  it could happen anywhere ” As many Muslims leapt to aid their Bosnian brothers and sisters  Siddiqui was at the front of the line  nThat line led her into the arms of Al Qaeda  Sometime in the early 1980s  an organization called the Al Kifah Refugee Center rented a mailbox in a squat brown building on Commonwealth Avenue in Allston  It was one of several addresses that belonged to the Brooklyn based center  now believed to have been the heart of Osama Bin Laden’s terrorist operations in the United States  The center  whose Brooklyn office has been linked to the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center in New York  operated publicly as a pro jihadi fund raiser for Muslim refugees and routinely solicited student activists  In the early 1990s  Siddiqui and several other Muslim Student Association members volunteered to help out  and they distributed the group’s newsletter  “Al Hussam ” which means “The Sword” in Arabic In March 1993  Siddiqui sent an e mail to local Muslim students asking them to send pledges to Al Kifah for orphans and widows they were sponsoring  She concluded  “Please keep up the spirit and motivate others as well       The Muslims of our Ummah need ALL the help we can provide them ” She signed it  “humbly  your sister  aafia ” nPrimed by her mother’s example  Siddiqui was an inspiring fund raiser whose rousing speeches prompted many to open their pockets  Never mind that her tiny frame  barely 5 feet tall  was almost hidden behind the lectern  the audience could see her small fists slashing the air “She would tell you that you had to give up some of your clothes for these people ” recalled Abdullah Faaruuq  imam of the Mosque for the Praising of Allah in Roxbury  “I had two pairs of boots and I was going to give up one  but I realized I could always buy another so I gave them both ”Waqas Jilani  the Clark grad student and a Muslim Student Association organizer  also remembers Siddiqui as a compelling speaker  But somewhere along the way  he said  her message changed from relief to armed resistance “Once she had our attention  she switched ” Jilani said  “She wanted us to get training and go overseas and fight  I was like  ‘what ’ u2009”Siddiqui also managed to talk some of the Muslim students into taking a shooting course with her  but once they got to the range  they found she had a lot to learn “We were all laughing like  ‘Uh oh  Aafia’s got a gun ’ u200a” Jilani said  “Part of it was because she was such a bad shot  but also because she was always mouthing off about the US and the FBI being so bad and all ”Siddiqui wasn’t laughing with them  In the mid 1990s  she took a 10 hour NRA shooting course at the Braintree Rifle   Pistol Club on her own  The instructor  who recalls she was a “reasonable shot ” declined to be identified  saying that after he testified at her 2010 trial he was brutally harassed Siddiqui’s newly acquired marksmanship skills presumably added luster to her resume as a budding jihadi  As Al Kifah became increasingly anti American in its message and openly blamed the United States for the bloodshed in Bosnia  Kohlmann said  Siddiqui appears to have embraced its violent positions  And the brothers of Al Kifah  ever hungry for financial support  embraced her right back “Aafia was from a prominent family with connections and a sympathy for jihad ” Kohlmann said  “She was just what they needed ” nIn the spring of 1995  a smiling Siddiqui posed at the edge of the Charles River for a college graduation photograph in mortar board and gown  a string of white pearls around her neck  Her parents presented her with more than the bouquet of red roses she held in her hands  They also had a husband for her His name was Mohammed Amjad Khan  the son of a wealthy Pakistani family who had recently graduated from medical school in Karachi  The two had met briefly the previous year  and Khan was pleased that his parents had chosen a “religious” girl for him Because of complications with Siddiqui’s visa  they were married over the telephone that fall  Dressed in white shalwar pants — loose pajama like trousers — and black waistcoat  Khan waited at a nearby mosque while Siddiqui’s father listened on a speaker phone in his Karachi living room as his daughter in the United States formally consented three times to the marriage  as required by Islamic law  The next day Khan flew to the United States But when he finally met his bride in Boston  he was shocked “I discovered that the well being of our nascent family unit was not her prime goal in life ” Khan  an anesthesiologist in Saudi Arabia  said in a telephone interview  “Instead  it was to gain prominence in Muslim circles ” nSiddiqui  as Khan recalls it  was actively preparing to go overseas  On weekends  she regularly participated in training trips in New Hampshire with the brothers from Al Kifah  which had changed its name to Care International after the New York bombing  She was fascinated by Islamic videos  sometimes tearing up as she watched a favorite one showing her hero Osama bin Laden eating from a simple bowl in a cave  And she begged her husband to give up his medical studies in order to serve as her “mahram ” or male traveling companion  nSiddiqui believed she was being watched  Months after the 1995 bombing of the federal building in Oklahoma City  she told Khan that the FBI wanted to talk to her and advised him not to call her on her cellphone “It seemed very strange to me  but I shrugged it off ” Khan said The couple took up residence on Prospect Street in Cambridge  blocks from the recently opened Islamic Society of Boston’s new mosque  Islamic Society spokesmen have said they have no record that Siddiqui visited the mosque  which was reportedly frequented by other extremists  in addition to Boston Marathon bombing suspect Tsarnaev  in recent years  But Khan said the couple attended services daily “Aafia was very socially conservative ” recalled Pam Taylor  then a member of the Muslim Student Association at Harvard University and the wife of Arif Khalid at MIT  “She was very comfortable at the mosque  while I  as someone more liberal  was not ”Despite mounting friction on the subject of jihad  Khan and Siddiqui soon began their family  Not long after they moved to a Malden high rise and Khan began his residency at Brigham   Women’s Hospital  Siddiqui gave birth to their first child Following in the footsteps of her father and sister  Siddiqui enrolled in a doctoral program in cognitive neuroscience at Brandeis in Waltham  Consumed with caring for her baby and with a mounting distaste for American culture  Siddiqui assumed a far lower profile there than she had at MIT Siddiqui worked in the lab of professor Robert Sekuler  pursuing an inquiry into how imitation relates to the process of learning  But  increasingly  religion began to seep into her studies  Biology professor Gina Turrigiano remembers the hijab clad Siddiqui in her introductory neurology class in 1996 writing in a short paper how the Koran had predicted a host of biomedical advances  Turrigiano summoned Siddiqui  she said  and “made clear this was not appropriate  and she stepped back ”But Siddiqui did it again in her second year  This time it was during student presentations before biology professor Eve Marder  Siddiqui’s subject was fetal alcohol syndrome  but halfway through her presentation she veered into an address about how the scientific paper had proven the Koran’s prohibition against alcohol to be correct  Marder walked out of the room without a word “She said that all of science was presaged by the Koran ” said Marder  “So I asked her  ‘Why do you have to do experiments ’ and she said  ‘To reveal the Koran’s wisdom ’ u200a” nAt home  things were getting worse  Shortly before Siddiqui gave birth in 1998 to their second child  the couple moved to a Roxbury high rise to be closer to Khan’s work  But Khan no longer brought colleagues home  Siddiqui  he said  wanted “only to talk about them converting to Islam  Invariably this would lead to unpleasantness  so I decided to keep my work separate ”Even with the demands of her dissertation and two young children  Siddiqui continued her efforts to spread the Islamic faith  At the squat red brick Mosque for the Praising of Allah on Shawmut Avenue  she established a Dawa Resource Center that provided free Islamic literature  Some of the volumes she ordered from India are still there  bound in the hopsacks in which they arrived But Imam Faaruuq said she never preached violence “This sister could be anybody ” Faaruuq said  “This country has an agenda against Islam  Once this country turns on you  this is what can happen ”Then aligned with Care International  Siddiqui was also working to raise money for the resistance in Chechnya and Kosovo  Although her supporters say that Siddiqui never had any part in terrorist activities  Khan said that his wife was becoming militantly anti American  angry in her conviction that the country was stifling mujahideen around the world “By now  all her focus had shifted to jihad against America  instead of preaching to Americans so that they all become Muslims and America becomes a Muslim land ” Khan said Early in 2001  Siddiqui completed her dissertation at Brandeis  titled “Separating the Components of Imitation ” In the acknowledgments  she thanked “my Creator and Sustainer  Allah  The Most Merciful  for helping me in every step of my dissertation ” nBiology professor John Lisman  a member of her dissertation committee  was impressed by her final presentation  But when he moved to offer congratulations  Lisman recalled in an e mail  Siddiqui refused to shake his hand No longer required to go on campus  Siddiqui now dressed like the jihadi she had become  in a conservative black abaya  When she began agitating anew to join the jihad abroad  simmering differences with her husband erupted in physical violence  according to both sides  Siddiqui’s sister says Khan was abusive toward her  Khan  who had gotten a job at Tufts Medical Center  says it was the other way around “Things reached their worst stage after she finished her PhD and she had nothing to look forward to except her ambition to wage jihad ” said Khan  “Divorce had become inevitable ”And then came Sept  11  2001  In the hours that followed the attacks  Siddiqui became increasingly agitated  She told her husband that she had learned something terrifying  The American government was “rounding up Muslim children and forcing them to convert to Christianity ” Adamant that she return to Pakistan  she insisted that Khan get airline tickets for her and the children  and somehow he did  Eight days after 9 11  Siddiqui and her children were on a plane headed to Karachi  nThe case against Aafia Siddiqui did not take long to build Two years after the Sept  11 attacks  Khalid Sheikh Mohammed  the alleged mastermind  apparently identified her as one of his accomplices  The FBI put out a global alert saying that Siddiqui  who had divorced and was believed to have remarried an Al Qaeda operative  was wanted for questioning Then it became official  At a press conference in May 2004  FBI Director Robert Mueller identified the seven most wanted Al Qaeda fugitives as he stood before large red and white posters of their menacing faces  The only female among them was Aafia Siddiqui  whom he identified as “an Al Qaeda operative and facilitator ” She was then the Most Wanted Woman in the World That woman remained at large  her whereabouts still unexplained  for nearly five years  In the summer of 2008  she was arrested in Afghanistan while holding a bag that authorities allege contained deadly poison and directions on how to make a bomb  While she was being interrogated the following day  Siddiqui is said to have picked up a rifle and shot at US agents while shouting “Death to America ” She was apparently the only one wounded in the fracas Eleven years after she raised her tiny fists in the air in a cramped MIT basement  Siddiqui had achieved her wish of making it on to the Most Wanted List  She may  in fact  have gotten far more than she wished for   n n', '2014_611')",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

choosing  passing over internal candidates and hiring from outside the system if need be  This year  relying on a loophole in the union contract  they have done just that  But freedom has come with a considerable cost  With the opening of schools just days away  more than 100 veteran teachers have no class assignments at all  sidelined despite a cost in salary and benefits of more than $10 million  t nThough lacking classes to teach  the 110 teachers will remain on the payroll because they have earned “permanent” status  It is largely not an issue of competence  In most cases the teachers’ performance evaluations were satisfactory  Just five of the teachers have received unsatisfactory evaluations and another 12 were deemed in need of improvement  according to School Department data requested by the Globe  Only two teachers were rated exemplary School officials say they made the change in hiring to ensure that each school can choose the best teachers  ones who match its approach to education  And they stress that the unchosen teachers will not be sitting around with nothing to do while collecting a paycheck  Instead  the school system said  it is assigning the teachers “suitable” temporary tasks  such as filling in as substitutes or working along side another classroom teacher The teachers could eventually land their own classrooms during the course of the year  officials said  as resignations or retirements pop up  The average annual teacher salary in Boston is $88 000 “It’s a small cost for us  overall  to make sure we have a great teacher in every classroom ” said Ross Wilson  assistant superintendent for human capital  “Instead of forcing the placement of teachers in the classroom  we are allowing schools to choose the teachers they want ”Richard Stutman  president of the Boston Teachers Union  said the mostly positive evaluation data on the sidelined teachers raise questions about why the School Department is hiring teachers from outside when they have veteran teachers who clearly know their craft and are getting results  t n“Given their level of accomplishment  to have these folks unplaced is not only a disservice to students but it is waste of resources and scarce funds ” Stutman said The union has filed a grievance about the new hiring practice  which is now in arbitration The change also may have had one unintended consequence  according to the data  A disproportionate  share of veteran teachers without jobs are black  accounting for 32 percent of those in that predicament  although black teachers make up only about 22 percent of the teaching force  “It’s disturbing ” said Johnny McInnis  a Boston school teacher and president of the Black Educators Alliance of Massachusetts  “There are a lot of great teachers in those numbers ”The problem comes as the school system is facing criticism that its revamped teacher evaluation system is disproportionately giving lower ratings to teachers of color and as the system continues to operate in violation of a  that requires a quarter of its teaching staff to be black  nLetting schools hire the teachers they want represents a dramatic change  Union contract rules had long dictated where teachers get placed It used to be that schools could not  in most cases  hire from outside the system until a pool of internal candidates had been depleted  Often principals and hiring committees were forced to take internal candidates who were a poor match The months long process of placing internal candidates also pushed the hiring of new teachers  into the summer  a less than ideal time to go on the open market because many of the most talented teachers have been snatched up by other districts But last fall  John McDonough  the interim superintendent   nrevealed he would take advantage of a little used provision in the teachers contract that would allow schools to bypass many of the hiring requirements spelled out in the contract That provision allows school officials to immediately consider outside candidates if they classify a position as requiring a special skill or extra duty  For instance  the winning candidate might have to do tutoring after school but would receive an extra $1 250 stipend in return It is a pricey endeavor  In addition to covering the salaries of permanent teachers without positions  the stipends are adding up to $1 2 million  The school system has launched a $25 million to help cover the costs School officials say the change has resulted in a successful reversal of the troubling trend of hiring most new teachers in the summer  This year  the system hired 83 percent of new teachers before July 1  compared with 9 percent the previous year  according to School Department data  Officials also say they slightly increased the diversity of teaching ranks “I think we’ve had a great hiring year ” Wilson said  “It’s a complete culture shift in how we post jobs ”He said the number of unplaced permanent teachers falls within the range officials initially anticipated  75 to 150  The hiring season this year started off with approximately 1 000 vacant positions  one of the highest levels in year  Helping to swell the numbers  four underperforming schools  including two going into state receivership  dismissed nearly all their teachers  which in turn increased the number of internal candidates needing jobs The system employs about 4 300 teachers  serving 57 000 students at 128 schools  Most of the schools open Thursday Ultimately  about 350 teachers wound up in the school system’s long controversial “excess pool”— teachers without jobs because they had been on leave  were dismissed from an underperforming school  or their jobs were eliminated because of budget cuts School officials say teachers in the excess pool who were the most aggressive in applying for  positions had the most luck in securing one  On average  the successful candidates sent out 19 applications compared with 12 for those not successful Some excess teachers did not submit a single application  school officials said Education advocates critical of the city’s powerful teachers union joined many parents and administrators in applauding the new hiring approach “The previous system was really insane  and it did not serve the system well at all ” said Paul Grogan  president of the Boston Foundation  a charitable organization that is helping the school system with its fund raising campaign and that has long called for giving schools more hiring autotomy  “I think it makes an enormous difference in the morale of the school that everyone is pulling in the same direction and wants to be there ” Kristin Barrali  who has a son at the Mendell Elementary School in Roxbury and another at the Bates Elementary School in Roslindale  recalls that under the old hiring system  schools sometimes took a gamble with internal candidates  She said one year the Mendell got an excellent veteran kindergarten teacher  but another time when she sat on the school’s hiring committee she cried after the interviews “I felt like we were forced to make a decision that was not good for kids ” she said  “Schools should be able to hire the teachers who are the best fit ”', '2014_378')",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

neck sweater signs me in  “Welcome to ‘Le Grand Continental’ Boston ” he says  “I’m Gary Dunning ” Turns out when Dunning’s not handing out nametags  he’s executive director of Boston’s Celebrity Series  When I’m not hip hopping empty hallways  I’m a middle age father and architect  But for the next 10 weeks  as March yields to spring  I’m going to be a dancer  It seems fitting that my journey begins in a high school  where so many of us try on new identities to explore what fits  nIn its 75th anniversary season  the Celebrity Series — which brings world renowned performers to Boston — is giving folks who usually sit in the audience an opportunity to perform  The celebration began last September  when the group placed 75 pianos around the city  and “Chopsticks” and Chopin triumphed over the sound of traffic  The festivities conclude Friday  Saturday  and Sunday with a choreographed street dance in Copley Square  Seven professional dancers and a team of logicians have turned more than 100 Boston area residents of all ages  shapes  and sizes into a coherent troupe  All we have to do is to stay on count  remember right from left  and nurse sore knees Canadian choreographer Sylvain Emard conceived “Le Grand Continental” in 2009  He’s produced it in Montreal  New York  and Mexico City  “Le Grand Continental” is an integrated collection of line dances that riff on familiar dance forms  including swing  salsa  disco  hip hop  and even the frug  Sylvain brings fresh amateurs together for each performance  though he never uses the word “amateur ” He calls us dancers and treats us as professionals despite our shaky moves My February audition induced all the excitement and anxiety of “A Chorus Line ” I was shuttled from registration to the changing area  a number got slapped on my chest  and I was propped before a black backdrop  “Say cheese ” The camera flash for my head shot blinded me  Then I was escorted to a rehearsal space where 40 other souls sported sequential numbers Sylvain lined us up and demonstrated steps  “1 2 3 4 chicken 5 6 7 8 push back 1 2 3 4 sashay 5 6 7 8  stomp  stomp  stomp ” Every eight counts had a unique mnemonic  I tried to re create his steps  but stumbled when I glimpsed my outstretched arms in the mirror  A Bob Fosse fantasy of tight moves and undulating cool confounded my reality  We repeated the routine to counts  then music  We expanded the sequence until it took shape  By audition’s end I was in step  “Le Grand Continental” strives to include a cross section of the community  and I saw little competition among the 59 year old white male demographic  Ten days later I received notice to report to Boston Latin Our first practice in March includes the requisite welcome  staff introductions  and nervous jokes  Sylvain climbs on a raised platform and counts out steps to “Song of India ” Tommy Dorsey’s jazz masterpiece inspired by a Rimsky Korsakov opera  Right foot forward  left  and a quick right left right left back  We add hand movements and repeat the phrase in each direction  Sylvain continues with eight counts of arm shifts  leg tucks  and head reverses  Each move is simple  but cumulatively complex  Our lines get tangled  Sylvain humors our frustration  “You can’t go too wrong  humans only have two legs ” nThere are 50 odd dancers in the gym  We will practice as two groups  A and B  through March  Then we’ll come together and coordinate our complementary steps  Aside from a 6 1 ratio of women to men  we’re a fair representation of our city  There’s a precocious 8 year old boy  a group of giggly Hispanic girls  an immense black women who moves so smoothly she appears weightless  several mother daughter teams  a preponderance of middle age women who  like me  forget our gray hair and gravity’s sag when our feet flow  and a handful of elderly ladies whose frail bodies are long past flexible  but whose steps are firm An hour in  we take everything from the top  with music  Our progress seems impressive until I realize we’ve learned less than a minute of our half hour performance  By the rehearsal’s second hour I’m tired  My movements are cautious and weary  I stand next to Cory  a peg shaped older woman who gives each phrase her own unique name  “Here comes Pee Wee Herman ” she mutters before a series of silly steps and slaps After two hours  our energy and attention are exhausted  Sylvain explains how to access practice videos online  Homework is one aspect of high school I could do without  but the sequence isn’t going to settle into my head without regular drilling Week one is “Song of India ” Week two is Junior Brown’s country anthem “My Wife Thinks You’re Dead ” On week three  Peter DiMuro  director of the Dance Complex in Cambridge  takes over

assistants  Renee Martin and Ryan Valente  lead warm ups  Twenty minutes are gone and I’m itching to dance  When we begin “Gogo Prado ” a fusion of Cuban bandleader Perez Prado’s music with Austin Powers like 1960s frenzy  I realize that the warm up included several key steps  “Gogo Prado” proves easy to learn  In my day  this is how we danced Each dance has familiar music  though never the rendition I recall  Peter explains  “The music is based on popular songs which have been reinterpreted by contemporary composers ” I realize that “Le Grand Continental” is not a medley  it’s a coherent composition  We don’t dance swing  then country  then pop  we interpret similar movements across different genres After four weeks at Boston Latin  Group B graduates in April and joins Group

tenuous  I’m sick of practice videos  The teachers demonstrate “Cumbia ” a six minute salsa number  The dance is awesome  but the prospect of learning all those moves is depressing  I slog through rehearsals  I count at home  I beat my steps into motor memory  I won’t be able to really dance until I no longer have to think What we dancers lack in ability we compensate for in motivation  We arrive early and organize impromptu practices  Lill  a skinny woman well past 60  marches through “Stuckfunk ” She calls out eight beat cues the way Pete Seeger used to lead folk songs  Everyone lines up behind her  We dip and stomp together  We don’t need Sylvain or Peter to corral us into action  we want to get this right A Friday evening rehearsal gets tossed into the end of April  Attendance is high  but our energy is low  When I don’t think I can absorb another eight count variation  Renee announces  “We’re going to dance the entire show  beginning to end  Don’t worry about what you miss  just stay with it ” It’s a lot to ask at the end of a long week  but when “Gogo Prado” plays  we move  And keep moving for 30 minutes  It’s ragged  Our lines are a mess  I take a wrong turn and run smack into my neighbor  But the momentum of the show boosts our energy  Twenty six minutes in  during the pulsing transition to “Champagne ” I feel a visceral connection to everyone else on the floor  It accelerates through our improvisation  and when the last downbeat thumps  we nail our final stance  That’s my turning point  Knowing the context  learning steps and sequences becomes easier  Six rehearsals remain  We have plenty to polish  but for the first time we’re confident With two weeks to go before our own perfomance  many of us attend the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater show at the Wang Center  We marvel at their precision and form  our most complex steps are their afterthoughts  My section leader  Ryan  belongs to the local dance troupe Urbanity  I go to their spring performance to witness his virtuosity  Being a citizen dancer has enhanced my appreciation for the art form But more importantly  “Le Grand Continental” has enhanced my appreciation for people beyond my usual crowd  Stephi and her mom  Judy  are my dancing buddies  Three years ago a car accident left Judy’s husband quadriplegic  She drives 73 miles from Palmer for rehearsal  “‘Le Grand Continental’ is my therapy ” she says with a smile and a shrug  Dancing lifts her spirits so she can better care for a man robbed of that pleasure  There’s also Saisely  Gabriella  Alain  and Gia

of Boston’s male residents age 19 or younger are black or Latino “That is the greater preponderance of young men in the city we have to invest in to make sure Boston is thriving and competitive moving forward ” Dorsey said “We really want to know what they are up against and what is working for them so we can better understand the investments we need to make in their lives ”The report  set to be released during  nan event at City Year Boston  is believed to be the most comprehensive analysis in recent memory of the performance of black and Latino males in Boston schools on an array of academic measures Typically  achievement by the two groups is highlighted within isolated performance measures  such as the annual release of MCAS results in the fall or in high school graduation rates released each winter The report  which examined data between 2009 and 2012  was prepared by the Center for Collaborative Education  a nonprofit in Boston  and the Annenberg Institute for School Reform at Brown University  Former Boston school superintendent Carol R  Johnson ordered the report Among some of the findings   Just 22 1 percent of black males and 24 9 percent of Latino males scored proficient or higher on the English MCAS exams in elementary school  compared with 56 9 percent for white males and 48 5 percent for Asian males    66 9 percent of black males and 60 4 percent of Latino males graduated within four years  compared with 81 5 percent of white males and 90 5 percent of Asian males The data reflect a national trend of low achievement among black and Latino males  prompting President Obama earlier this year to launch an educational initiative  “My Brother’s Keeper ” which aims to develop strategies to help the two groups do better in school and throughout their lives But the problem is particularly critical in Boston because Massachusetts’ economy relies more on highly skilled workers than most other states  according to the report The School Department’s failure to help many black and Latino males acquire the necessary job training could make it more difficult for them to gain long term employment and lead to unhealthy decisions that could be a drain on the city’s vitality  it states  nJohnny McInnis  president of the Black Educators Alliance of Massachusetts who teaches in Boston  said he feels the school system is making incremental progress in addressing the achievement gap  but has been hamstrung by budget cuts and the lack of broader solutions “We are losing people we need who specialize in supporting these students ” he said The report does not offer concrete explanations for the lagging achievement of black and Latino males  Dan French  executive director of the Center for Collaborative Education  said it is an area for deeper examination Another  by the local Black and Latino Collaborative explored the plight of black and Latino males on a number of indicators that affect their well being beyond the school doors That report noted  for instance  that nearly half of those two populations age 19 or younger were on public assistance — twice the rate as whites and Asians Ayomide Olumuyiwa  a student representative on the Boston School Committee  said he was unaware that black and Latino males were lagging until it was mentioned at a recent committee meeting “It’s just alarming ” said Olumuyiwa  a senior at the O’Bryant School of Math and Science  an exam school in Roxbury  “This is something students wouldn’t find out on their own unless they asked ”Olumuyiwa self identifies as a first generation African American whose parents are from Nigeria  He started off his education in Randolph and then moved to Boston in the seventh grade  He said he recalls that his first math class in Boston covered the same material he had in the fifth grade in Randolph “I thought they made a mistake ” Olumuyiwa said The latest report offers wide ranging recommendations  including some that would likely stoke opposition For instance  it recommends converting every classroom in grades 4 to 6 into advanced work programs  The program  a gateway into the exam schools  enrolls few black and Latino males  But the recommendation would probably stir debate about whether all students are ready for that rigor or whether advanced work would be watered down Other recommendations endorse efforts already underway  such as expanding early childhood education and the diversity of the teaching force  and stepping up efforts to train teachers on any unintentional biases against others of different races  That latter area could address why black and Latino males are disciplined or suspended at higher rates “Youth understand fairness far better than adults ” said Matt Cregor  staff lawyer with the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights and Economic Justice “When students don’t feel like they are being treated fairly or disciplined fairly they become disengaged and they could drop out ’  he said  “We can’t risk disengaging youth this way if we want them to succeed ”', '2014_734')",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

handful of his young ballplayers in a light workout “Head down  Keep your feet sturdy ” barked Lewis as he tossed pitches to Hugo Mateo  17  a Madison Park High School junior from Everett who’s hoping to play for Lewis’s elite 17 and under travel team this summer   nMateo has bigger dreams than baseball  Neither of his parents attended college  A National Honor Society nominee  he hopes to break that pattern  As a coach  Lewis “tells you what you’re strong at and weaker at ” Mateo said  “He always says it’s academics first  then baseball  though  Which is key ” Lewis  54  has long been associated with Boston Astros baseball  an inner city program he founded 35 years ago  and with organizations such as The Boston Foundation and City Year  where he’s held senior leadership positions  His latest professional chapter  The BASE program in Roxbury  combines two of his great passions  youth baseball and mentoring black and Latino kids  in a program aiming to clear a path to college for youths challenged with finding one on their own His timing seems unusually propitious  A recent report commissioned by the Black and Latino Collaborative  a group representing businesses  philanthropic organizations  and aides to elected officials  highlights the fact that black and Latino youths now make up nearly two thirds of the city’s 19 and under male population  and that how this group fares  educationally and otherwise  will have a significant impact on Boston’s future  Indeed  opening ceremonies for The BASE headquarters in Egleston Square drew a cross section of leaders interested in showing their support for the program and for Boston’s inner city youth “What you saw when you looked around that room — law enforcement officials and clergy  educators and athletes  black people and white — reflects the essence of what  Lewis  is doing ” Harvard Law professor Charles Ogletree said later  “Now he’s using baseball  of all things  to open up opportunities for young men ” nBy locating his new program in the heart of Roxbury  Ogletree added  “He’s not only talking the talk  he’s walking the walk ”The BASE offers academic tutoring combined with year round baseball instruction and an intensive training program for area baseball coaches  Beginning last fall  it opened its facility to 150 youths in grades 7 12  most from Roxbury  Mattapan  and Dorchester  and plans to serve 400 or more as it expands  Meanwhile  Lewis has raised over $12 million in pledged scholarships  academic and athletic  from area colleges — with substantially more to come  he says Eighty percent of the program’s enrollees are Latino and another 15 percent are African American  according to Lewis  who recruits players through a well established network of high school coaches and youth baseball coordinators  Many come from families scarred by street violence  One former Boston Astros player turned his life around by leaving gang life for baseball  then pitching his Oklahoma junior college to a national title   “These kids have been underdogs their whole lives ” Lewis said  “They know how to find their way to a wake  But finding a college campus  most of them are clueless ”To use the facilities and play for any of the teams with which Lewis’s program is associated — these include Astros teams of all age levels  13 and up  town league teams  and all star travel squads — players must either stay in school  join an accredited job training program  or pursue a GED  Compliance is closely monitored by Lewis and his staff  No school  no baseball In January 2013  Lewis walked away from a six figure job at the Boston Foundation and began formulating a blueprint for The BASE  drawing upon his contacts among coaches  educators  and donors  “For 35 years  I’d been telling my kids to work hard and swing for the fences ” Lewis said  explaining his decision to trade business suits for blue jeans  Philanthropic work was rewarding  he added  but not as satisfying as working one on one with talented  hungry young athletes  “I missed the hustle ” he said  “I wanted to feel what they were feeling ”Spotting baseball talent was easy enough — Lewis has kept his hand in coaching for nearly four decades — but evaluating character was equally crucial to his program’s success  He refuses to label his recruits “at risk” or “underprivileged ”“I’m not selling them short that way ” he said  “Excellence is the minimum here  We call these kids ‘great ’ because that’s what they are ” To spend time around Lewis and his players  on and off the field  is to witness both an old dream being realized and new dreams taking shape in the bloom of baseball season  At the opening of the clubhouse  packed with politicians  community leaders  corporate executives  and Astros ballplayers  current and former  guests toured the 7 100 square foot facility  which features meeting and study space  a computer lab  and indoor batting cages  Speakers included ex big leaguer Darrell Miller  director of Major League Baseball’s Urban Youth Academy in Compton  Calif   and college presidents Francesco Cesareo  Assumption  and Richard Lloyd  Vermont’s St  Joseph   who together have pledged $6 6 million in scholarships to the program over the next four tears   There’s no fee for participants  but there are plenty of perks  including after school tutoring and SAT test prep  free medical and dental services  nutrition and financial counseling  and trips to college fairs  Starting in September  The BASE will host classes credited toward an associate degree cosponsored by Endicott College and the Benjamin Franklin Institute of Technology  Underwriting The BASE’s $1 5 million annual operating budget is a starry lineup of financial institutions  charitable foundations  sports programs  and other nonprofits  among them The Boston Foundation  Eastern Bank  the law firm WilmerHale  The Lewis Family Foundation  and the Epstein family’s Foundation to be Named Later  Lewis calls them “my team ” and like any head coach he’s picky about who’s on his roster  “Every one must have a history of working with black and Latino boys ” he said  Some of his kids have been kicked out of other programs  he explained  because no one in authority understood what these youths were dealing with back home  “I want partners who realize that if a kid acts up sometimes  it might be because his best friend got shot ” Lewis said  nWhen his turn came to speak at opening ceremonies  a beaming Lewis said that while having an indoor training facility in the heart of Roxbury is a prized asset  “You’re tricked if you think this  program  is about baseball  It’s a tool to make young people great ”While that may be true  the baseball played under Lewis’s tutelage over the past few seasons has been pretty impressive  too Last year  his Astros’ 18U squad won the Triple Crown Sports US Baseball Championships in Virginia  its second such title in three years  besting teams from 21 states  The 2012 18U Astros were named Triple Crown Sports Team of the Year  another rare honor  and 15 of 16 teammates on the 2013 roster have gone on to play college baseball  Most remarkable  according to players like star slugger Malcolm Nachmanoff  was the contrast between the Astros’ diversity and the mostly suburban teams they competed against  Nachmanoff  19  is bound for Stony Brook University after completing a post grad year at Loomis Chaffee  a Connecticut prep school “Ours was black  white  and Spanish ” recalled Nachmanoff  “We were playing predominantly white teams who’d never seen an inner city travel team like that before ”Many players currently enrolled in Lewis’s program will gather June 9 for a college letter of intent signing ceremony  Lewis expects that at least a few of them will also be selected in the upcoming MLB draft  Count Boston College head baseball coach Mike Gambino as another fan rooting for Lewis to succeed  The two met earlier this year and “hit it off immediately ” according to Gambino “What Robert talks about is similar to what we talk about at BC  that baseball is important  but it’s more important we develop our players as people ” said Gambino  “I love his mission and his values  Anything we can do to help further that mission and grow the game of baseball  I’m in ”', '2014_148')",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

possible child neglect after she accidentally locked her 11 month old son inside her air conditioned car Nikysha Harding  36  said she was picking up her son  Nicholas  from his Roxbury day care provider on July 10  and used her automatic starter to switch on the car and cool it off for the boy  t nThe starter only works when the doors are locked  and Harding said that after she buckled her son into his car seat and shut the door  she realized she had left her keys in the car  Harding said she immediately called 911  and implored police and firefighters to free her son They got him out  but what followed is a dispute between a mother who believes police overstepped their bounds because she is black  and a department that says it must take seriously any hint of parental neglect Harding  who heads the Boston Public Health Commission’s Tobacco Prevention and Control Program  filed a complaint last Monday with the Boston Police Department Internal Affairs Division against Sergeant Sean Martin  alleging that she was racially profiled  Boston police officials stand behind the officers’ decision  calling it a reaction to a disturbing sight  a child locked inside a car on a hot day “The actions of the officers were warranted  and they always encourage an overreaction of this type when it comes to a child being locked in a car ” said Sergeant Michael McCarthy  a department spokesman  “We want our officers to make that notification  No question ”But Harding said it should have been immediately clear that she was a distraught parent who quickly realized her mistake  t nPolice said in their report that Harding’s day care provider told a black  Spanish speaking officer that Harding had locked her son in her car and left him to go inside the day care center  which is on the second floor  and only realized her mistake when she returned to the car But the day care provider and another witness told the Globe that Harding never left the child alone  The provider  who asked that her name be withheld in the Globe because she feared retaliation  said in an interview that she never spoke to police except to give them her name “I never talked to anyone ” she said  “If I had  I never would have said what they said I did ”A Globe reporter told McCarthy of the day care provider’s allegations and provided her name  “Officers base their decisions on what they’re told at the time ” said McCarthy  “She told the officer that Ms  Harding left the baby unattended while she came to say goodbye to her  Why she wants to change that now  that’s something you’d have to ask her ”But the day care provider insisted she never gave such an account  In a signed statement written in Spanish that Harding filed along with her complaint  the day care provider said that on July 10  she was outside the day care center  which she runs out of her Roxbury apartment  Harding was parked in front of the building  She placed Nicholas in the car seat  closed the door  and immediately panicked “In that moment ” the day care provider wrote  “she realized what happened ”The two women flagged down another mother  Yessenia Pena  who had just started driving away from the center “It happened in seconds ” said Pena  “She never went in  to the day care center  ”Harding called police on the day care provider’s cellphone  according to the statement  and police and firefighters arrived immediately  Firefighters freed Nicholas by breaking the window of her car  The child  weeping and visibly frightened  was unharmed “Mrs  Harding  throughout that whole process  never left her car  not for one minute ” wrote the day care provider  “I still had two children that needed rides  so I was there the whole time in front of the building ”According to the police report  soon after Nicholas was freed  two officers  one white and one black  told Harding they had to file a report of possible abuse or neglect with the Department of Children and Families  a report known as a 51A Harding said she was incredulous and asked to speak to their supervisor Martin  who is white  approached her  and Harding said she told him she believed race was a factor in how police were treating her “If I were a white lady in Hyde Park  this would not happen ” Harding said  according to the police report  “Because I’m black in this neighborhood  you guys are going to file a 51A ”Harding’s complaint says that Martin’s response was  “ u2002‘You know what  Now I’m going to file a 51A ’ u2002” That statement is not in the police report Harding’s Internal Affairs complaint asks for an apology and an investigation into what happened “Sergeant Martin frivolously filed a 51A against me in bad faith solely because I am a black woman ” reads the complaint  “His unjust and unfair treatment towards me caused me deep emotional suffering  embarrassment  humiliation  and shame ”McCarthy said Police Commissioner William Evans and the department’s Office of the Legal Advisor were aware of the complaint and had read the police report  and found the decision to file the 51A “more than justified ”McCarthy said race has nothing to do with an officer’s decision to report a parent to DCF None of the officers on the scene has a disciplinary record  he said About 38 children each year die in the United States after being left in hot cars  according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration McCarthy said that police are trained to err on the side of caution when considering whether to file a 51A  The report does not indicate wrongdoing  he said  It is a mechanism to initiate an investigation by DCF into what officers believe could be the result of neglect or abuse “The officers’ response  and what their observations are at the time  is that the child is locked in a car on a hot day ” he said Records from DCF provided by Harding show that there were two 51As filed in the July 10 case  The identities of the officials who filed the reports are redacted on each  One 51A reflects the police report and states that the mother left the child in the car unattended Harding believes the second 51A was filed by EMS workers after they were summoned by police The second 51A states that the person who filed it “believes that there is a miscommunication between what the day care provider stated to police and what the provider told the reporter ” and believes “it was an accident ” The person who filed the second 51A ascribes the misunderstanding to a language barrier McCarthy said the officer who interviewed the day care provider speaks Spanish Harding said she did not file a complaint about the second 51A because she believes it was prompted by the filing of the first 51A An EMS spokeswoman declined to comment on whether EMS workers filed the second 51A  Both reports were “screened out ” said DCF spokeswoman Cayenne Isaksen  Screening out happens  Isaksen said in an e mail  when “the report does not involve a child or the allegations are not within the Department’s mandate  and or there is no reasonable cause to believe that a child ren  has been or may have been abused or neglected ” She did not elaborate Boston EMS took Nicholas to Boston Medical Center  where medical records provided by Harding show that caregivers found nothing wrong “His mother is appropriate  with reasonable story and quick response to him being locked in the car ” the records read  “Social worker met with family and agreed that no need to file 51A at this time ”Harding said she felt police dismissed her as a stereotype  a neglectful black mother collecting state checks and driving an expensive car Thomas Nolan  a former Boston police officer who is chairman of the Department of Criminal Justice at the State University of New York at Plattsburgh  said police working in communities like Roxbury are generally sensitive to racial issues  The situation  he said  does not sound like a straightforward case of racist officers targeting minorities But Nolan said that if “the mother of the child were perceived by the police as ‘hostile ’ ‘belligerent ’ ‘displaying a bad attitude ’         they might be conceivably more inclined to file the 51A ”Dorothy Roberts  a professor of Africana studies  law  and sociology at the University of Pennsylvania and a specialist on the role of race in the child welfare system  said that black parents are more likely to be reported for child abuse or neglect to child welfare authorities than white parents  Studies have shown  she said  that racial bias plays a role in this discrepancy “The sense that this black mother has that she’s being treated this way  it’s not made up ” said Roberts  “It’s not to say that the studies can prove racial bias in this particular case  but it does give some credence and credibility to what this mother is saying ”', '2014_1049')",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

years ago  the federal jurist was ready for the firestorm that ensued “He knew full well that there were people that would not accept it  that were blind to the facts or just didn’t care about the facts ” said Brian LeClair  a law clerk for Garrity when the landmark decision was issued June 21  1974  n“He knew there was going to be a lot of opposition ” LeClair  now a lawyer in Marblehead  said in a phone interview Friday The opinion was the culmination of more than two years of legal action dating to March 1972  when a group of black parents filed a lawsuit alleging that the public schools were segregated and that they gave black students an inferior education Garrity ruled that the Boston school system was unconstitutionally divided  writing that school officials “knowingly carried out a systematic program of segregation affecting all of the city’s students  teachers  and facilities and have intentionally brought about and maintained a dual school system ”The order directed the schools to implement the state Board of Education’s busing program until a longer term plan was worked out  Thousands of students  teachers  and administrators were reasssigned  based on race  to different schools  often requiring the children to be bused into unfamiliar neighborhoods LeClair  now 66  remembered sifting through thousands of pages of documents including depositions and trial transcripts while the decision was being drafted  He provided Garrity with drafts that the judge painstakingly reviewed  working through lunches that he routinely ended with two rituals  eating an apple and doing chinups in a small men’s room  nGarrity’s secretary  Alice O’Neil  using an IBM Selectric  typed up the final product “She was the one grinding this thing out ” LeClair said  “We would make corrections in pen on the pages  and then Alice had to go back and retype it ”Once the opinion was finished  it provided a long and detailed account of segregation in the Boston public schools “I think the evidence was sort of overwhelming for anyone who honestly looked at the circumstances ” said LeClair  “I really don’t think there were any surprises ”Former mayor Raymond Flynn recalled sitting in the courtroom at the John W  McCormack US Post Office and Courthouse  listening intently  when the decision was announced “I saw so many flaws with it ” said Flynn  who was a state representative at the time “It’s one thing to tell people this is what’s going to happen to your children ” Flynn said  “It’s another thing to say this is what’s going to happen to your children and we don’t care what you think about it ”Garrity’s son  W  Arthur Garrity III  said by phone Friday that he had come home from college for the summer a few weeks before the opinion was issued  He recalled a woman coming to the family’s Wellesley home after the decision came down to speak with his father about it “I have a distinct memory of him sitting on the step outside the house and spending maybe a half hour or so just talking to her about whatever her situation was in kind of a mild mannered way  which was always his style  in an attempt to help her understand ” Garrity III said Federal marshals were assigned to protect Garrity because of death threats against him and other judges presiding over desegregation cases across the country  his son said  Garrity gave up taking the train to work  and was driven in by a deputy US marshal  but his family never changed their home phone number or screened the mail  his son said “He never exhibited any signs that he himself was concerned for his safety ” his son said  “He never acted nervous or ever said anything about the security ”In Roxbury  Lyda Peters  a former Boston public school teacher  said that once the desegregation order was issued  activists in the black community turned their attention to trying to ensure the safety of students when the busing began at the start of the school year “People were preparing to protect the kids ” said Peters  who later worked for the Metropolitan Council for Educational Opportunity and the School Desegregation Response Project at Boston University School of Medicine Michael Curry  president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People Boston  which filed the lawsuit that resulted in Garrity’s decision  was 6 years old when he was bused from Roxbury to Charlestown to attend first grade at the Warren Prescott School in 1975 He recalled the bus driving past the Museum of Science and over a bridge into Charlestown  where a crowd had gathered “I didn’t understand race  I didn’t understand busing  I didn’t understand who Garrity was ” Curry said by phone  “I did understand that our lives were at risk  by the fear of the adults on the bus ”Donna Bivens is collecting stories like Curry’s for a project for the Union of Minority Neighborhoods called the Boston Busing Desegregation Project  The group held a forum Thursday at City Hall to discuss the court decision’s legacy “That’s the kind of exchange that still needs to happen for people to not get so stuck in their stories but to see how this history is impacting Boston today ” Bivens said  “We really want to continue to collect stories and deepen our understanding of how different racial groups and communities experienced this history ”Mayor Martin J  Walsh said in a statement that “many people who lived through that time feel their voices have not yet been heard ”“It is healthy for Bostonians to share their memories and for all of us to learn from the city’s past ” Walsh said  “At the same time  we have made great progress as a city  and our children give us hope for an even brighter future  I take this occasion to voice  once again  my commitment to making sure every child in Boston has access to high quality  nurturing schools that are integral parts of safe and welcoming communities ”Garrity’s son said that if his father were alive today  he would most likely be occupied by another milestone in his life  his 94th birthday  which would have occurred on Friday  The judge died in 1999 “He wouldn’t be looking for any more than spending time

leader or a bit more money    The Roxbury high school was once a grand project  In the 1960s  Boston city planner Ed Logue claimed it would “give Latin School a run for its money ” and Judge W  Arthur Garrity  who ordered busing in Boston  was a big fan  Over the years  however  the school has deteriorated into a textbook reminder of what can go wrong when governments use physical capital — like a vast school campus — to solve a human capital problem  In this case  the real problem is the shortage of residents in inner city neighborhoods with usable job skills   t nAnd that is why the time for modest reform at Madison Park is over  The school’s basic model is broken — a sledgehammer is now needed  not fine tuning  Madison Park’s campus should be split up into a set of smaller  nimbler academies  Boston should take what has worked in other cities  such as Worcester  and set about to innovate with vocational training delivered through competitively sourced  rigorously evaluated programs that operate into the evening hours  on weekends  and over the summer   are now infamous  Students didn’t receive their class schedules for the first five days of the academic year   nShortly thereafter  the school headmaster resigned — not for this administrative snafu  but because  Apparently  she started the application process but never completed the paperwork   nSuch stories are sadly not new for Madison Park  In 2013  the school’s acting headmaster “was placed on administrative leave” because of “a federal investigation of his alleged role in a multiple state credit fraud ring ”    nAnd Madison Park’s test scores are dismal    nThe school’s shortcomings are particularly painful because the need for effective job training is so great  Boston’s labor market is robust  The average employee working in Suffolk County took home $75 000 in 2012  according to the US Census’s County Business Patterns  Yet too many Bostonians lack the skills to compete in that labor market  Census figures also report that nearly 30 percent of all households in Boston earned less than $25 000  Twenty seven percent of Boston’s children live in poverty And yet  in other places around the country  good vocational skills have proven to be a ticket out of poverty  If poor children grow up to be plumbers or electricians or programmers  they can join the middle class  So why can’t Madison Park seem to deliver those skills  First  its unwieldy size and overly broad mission make innovation and change difficult  Madison Park  which has some 20 technical career majors  may be trying to do too much  Other districts’ experiences suggest the most effective vocational training is often narrowly focused  allowing strong connections to local employers who  in turn  become teachers themselves of applied skills  Then there is Madison Park’s place in the Boston Public Schools  For many students  it is the high school assignment of last resort — the kids who go there simply didn’t get in anywhere else  But other models have shown that the students who thrive in vocational programs are those who have shown to have already shown an interest or aptitude for what they’re learning  In Boston  however  vocational training traditionally has been seen as a less challenging academic pursuit  and because the district has school choice  ambitious students steer clear of Madison Park  That has harmed Madison Park even more  Student quality shapes school quality  and for years  Madison Park has attracted far fewer students than its capacity   that will fix the fundamental problems that bedevil Madison Park  To attract the city’s most tenacious students  the school’s current structure must be overhauled  The best approach starts with enough humility to recognize that we don’t know the perfect solution  Yes  there are much hailed models  such as Worcester Technical High School  with high graduation rates  that may offer some guidance  A 2013 Pioneer Institute white paper  for example  suggests independence is one key to success at Worcester Tech  But I’d add that when you don’t know the right path  experimentation makes sense  Under schools chancellor Joel Klein  New York City split many of its larger schools into smaller ones  Madison Park seems like an ideal candidate for this approach  too  Smaller academies would allow for highly specialized curricula as well as a range of education innovations  Some could be run as private schools  others as charters  Some could team up with trade unions  others with community colleges  Any path forward should maintain Madison Park’s commitment to vocational training  But that could also be a more fluid concept  Boston’s proud history of liberal arts education has stigmatized technical education — so why not create a more hybrid model  Students could take regular high school classes during the day and then receive vocational training after school and on the weekends  That could lead into relevant summer employment or apprenticeship  There are four great virtues of the hybrid approach  First  we could hand vocational training over to professionals — experts in software programming or carpentry  In fields that change rapidly  such specialization would ensure teachers who are up on the latest technologies  Specialization has virtues when dealing with serious real world skills  Second  we would end the segregation of vocational students  which can feel a lot like segregation by race or ethnicity  Third  we could ensure that a wider range of students receive proper high school training across the board  We should want to provide everyone with a well rounded education  Fourth  competitively sourced vocational training programs could be evaluated with randomized control methods  We could enlarge programs that work and shut down the worst performers  This is radical surgery  but that’s what Madison Park needs  We have failed its students for too long  Boston must act radically if it is going to start providing better vocational training   n•  n•  n•  n•  n', '2014_675')",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Boston and around the nation are questioning whether an overwhelmingly white police force is prejudging people of color in a Missouri town where two thirds of the 21 000 residents are black Ferguson

Center of Afro American Artists in Boston  expressed concerns with what he called the militarization of police  leaving a “force that looks like ‘Miami Vice’ ” to confront the protesters “In a

unfortunate incidents” in Ferguson and one in New York in which a 43 year old black man died in a police chokehold “remind us of the importance of our obligations to our residents and neighborhoods in

League of Eastern Massachusetts has also been involved in that dialogue  he said “They are tough conversations  It’s not always a love fest ” said Superintendent in Chief William Gross  the first African American in that position  “But at least we’re having conversations before things happen ”Gross said the department is committed to avoiding the problems in Ferguson “Will there be bumps in the road  Yes  Will there be controversial interactions and arrests  Yes  But will the strength of the partnerships hold true ” he asked  “So far  they have ”Gross would not critique the Ferguson police but did say he was confident that Boston police would find “a peaceful resolution” in such a situation Three factors that contributed to the crisis in Ferguson — lack of diversity on the police force   the complaint review process  no sensitivity training for officers — are areas Boston must set right to avoid a similar fate  Curry said Only three members of Ferguson’s 53 member police force are black  “When you don’t have diverse perspectives around the table  you get flawed results ” he said  “How do you perceive these young men with braids who are sagging with swag ”As a college student or a criminal  he wondered US Representative James Clyburn  one of the highest ranking blacks in Congress  said Thursday that the situation in Missouri is the result of a growing climate of racial tensions manifesting since President Obama’s election “It’s clear to me that this is not happening in a vacuum ” he said at a book signing event at Roxbury Community College As dusk fell

around at the championship banners  and a warm feeling washed over him “It’s the Celtics ” the Roxbury native and ex UConn point guard said after his workout at the facility Monday  n“Growing up  when you’re a Boston fan  you get chills every time you watch the game  It took me about 5 10 minutes to realize that I was here ”Napier met with local media wearing a green and white gingham shirt  which he swore was a coincidence — just the cleanest shirt in his suitcase after traveling the country to workout for a half dozen NBA teams But in a session that lasted nearly 15 minutes  Napier gushed about his hometown team  saying he will always “bleed green ” and that he has heard from plenty of friends and family that hope the Celtics draft him “I grew up in Boston  so that’s all we know ” Napier said  “We were watching one of the films in there that they put up and one of the guys was like  ‘Why were folks crying when Paul Pierce injured himself in the playoffs and they picked him up off the court ’ I said  ‘That’s Boston  You won’t ever understand it unless you play for Boston or you’ve lived in Boston ’“That’s just how we are  We love our teams  There’s no bandwagon fans in Boston  Whether we have a great year or not  we all support like it’s the best team we got  He was like  ‘Man  Boston is crazy ’ I said  ‘That’s what we are  Some crazy fans that want nothing but the best for our teams ’ It’s just crazy to even be here  I think it’s kind of insane  It’s a blessing ” nNapier  who bookended a four year career at UConn with national championships  is projected to be picked in the mid to late first round of the June 26 draft  meaning he could be available when the Celtics are picking No  17 But he said he hasn’t allowed himself to dream about the possibility of playing for the team that he grew up watching “I haven’t really thought about that ” he said  “It is crazy  though  actually working out for them  The last time I remember being here was when I was younger — the Antoine Walker camp  I was really  really young then  To come back here and actually work out for the Celtics is definitely extraordinary ”Though Napier offers an impressive college résumé  especially after leading the Huskies to a title as a senior when he averaged 18 0 points  5 9 rebounds  and 4 9 assists per game  teams question his size  6 feet 1 inch  “Shabazz is not physically overwhelming  but he has toughness  intelligence  and skill  And he’s got extra savvy ” said Austin Ainge  the Celtics’ director of player personnel  “He’s going to make it  in the NBA  is my guess  He’s a good player ” Said Celtics coach Brad Stevens  “ Winning is  big to me  I think guys that win find ways to win ”Stevens knows Napier well  as the two faced off in college in the 2011 NCAA title game  when Napier’s UConn team beat Stevens’s Butler Bulldogs  53 41 “Obviously  a big time player who  no matter what  when the lights are the brightest  he’s at his best ” Stevens said  “Kudos to him for the career that he’s had and it’s pretty incredible when you think about a guy winning two national titles in his four years in college  Big fan of his ” Napier projects as a backup point guard in the NBA  Both Ainge and Stevens discussed the importance of depth Despite the fact that undrafted rookie Phil Pressey proved to be a capable backup point guard last season  the Celtics still don’t have much depth behind starter Rajon Rondo  who chatted with Napier on Monday “I would love to be under  Rondo  ” Napier said  “I’m going to be a sponge  and  he’s one of those smart guys that really understands the game  Me and him just chatted it up a little bit ” As Napier makes the round with NBA teams  he said he’s trying to convey his leadership above all else “That’s kind of what I’m good at ” he said  “I’m a communicator  I vocalize on the court  I kind of give instructions to help us win games  That’s one thing that I do well  I’ve been through a lot  experienced a lot  I understand what my team needs at certain times of the game ”He also believes that winning is the most important aspect of his résumé “At the end of the day  you want to win ” Napier said  “That’s just how it goes  It doesn’t matter if someone is 7 feet or 5 feet  If he knows how to win  he knows how to win  That’s kind of what I can bring  I’ve been through a lot  I didn’t win a lot  but I won enough  I’ve lost a lot in my life  and that helped me understand how to win games ”No matter where he is drafted  Napier said he’ll always pull for the Celtics “Of course ” he said  “I wouldn’t be able to say that I bleed green if I didn’t say that  Of course  in the back of your mind  if the Celtics are in the championship game and my team isn’t playing  of course I’m going to root for them  “That’s just how I am  I’ve been brought up in this         and when people say Boston  I say home of champions  Patriots  Bruins  Red Sox  Celtics  It’s just something that we were all brought up in at a young age  “Like I said  I wouldn’t be able to say I’m from Boston if I didn’t root for them ”', '2014_569')",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Reverend Clergy attending  Governor Patrick  Senators Warren and Markey  Congressmen Capuano and Lynch and Congresswoman Clark  Speaker DeLeo  Senate President Murray and all my former colleagues in the legislature  good morning to you all  To the current members of the City Council  congratulations  I look forward to working with you for the people of Boston  To the former members of the City Council  thank you for your service  and good luck in your new endeavors  To the Mayors who have led this city before me  and provide me powerful inspiration  and to their families joining us today  Ambassador and Mrs  Ray Flynn  members of the Menino  White  Collins  Hynes  and Fitzgerald families  thank you for being here  To all the people of Boston  and especially to the first responders who keep us safe  your heroism is what keeps Boston Strong  We are a city of courage and champions … of hope and heart  We are city of second chances and redemption … a place where hard times have forged character throughout our history  We are a city of proud families  and neighborhoods with big hearts and welcoming arms that make everyone feel like family  We are a city of high achievement and creative genius  Our educators  scientists  doctors  and artists are changing the world  We are city of big dreams  and we have what it takes to make dreams come true  And if you doubt any of that  look at this kid from Taft Street in Dorchester who’s now your Mayor  I know my mother’s not the only one surprised  Today  we are sworn in together  Together  we are committing to do all we can for the city we love  Together  we can move our great city forward  This past weekend   even in the face of a blizzard    we came together in community service  We painted our children’s schools  served meals to the homeless  shoveled out some of our neighbors  In the cold of winter  we demonstrated that every season is for service  We brought our young people together and were energized by their hopes and dreams  On Saturday  I met a young man  formerly troubled  who is now an honor student  and spoke of young people standing up  We shared a Sunday morning with our seniors  inspired by their experience and the lessons of their lives  I met again the 101 year old woman who went out and voted for me on Election Day  She invited me to her hundred and second birthday in May  I will be there  And  at Old South Church yesterday afternoon  we prayed   bringing together across different faiths and traditions  our shared hopes for our city  Since Election Day  and during our transition  we have invited  welcomed  and applauded thousands of people as they have stepped up and spoken out  And we listened  More than one thousand people came out on a snowy day to share their ideas at our town hall meeting at Roxbury Community College  More than one thousand people  And we listened  At our town halls and community meetings  through letters  email and phone calls  you are making your voices heard  I am listening   and I always will  I will listen  I will learn  I will lead  The people of Boston aren’t shy about saying what they think   about everything from politics to the Patriots  But I know you’re just as ready to back up the talk with action  I have seen it every day I’ve lived in this city  And that is every day of my life  It is the fabric of this city  woven throughout our history  Boston earned its reputation  This is the city that started the revolution that gave us a nation  We fought tyranny  We stood up to slavery  We opened our doors to immigrants  And when our gay and lesbian neighbors reminded us of the rights they were being denied  we backed their fight  and helped our Commonwealth become the first to protect those rights in law  Boston has been called  a “City upon a Hill ” I can’t tell you how many times I’ve heard someone use that phrase to make a lofty point  But let me tell you what I think about when I hear it  with apologies to John Winthrop  the Puritan settler who said it first  We are a City Upon a Hill  but it’s not just the shining light of Beacon Hill  It’s Savin Hill  where I live  It’s Bunker Hill  Bellevue Hill and Fort Hill  It’s Pope’s Hill  Jones Hill  and Telegraph Hill  It’s Copp’s Hill  Mission Hill and Eagle Hill  So when I say we are sworn in together  it means we’re in this together  We are in this together   every neighborhood  We are in this together   every race and religion  We are in this together  every man  woman and child  For our seniors and our students  for rich and poor  and everyone in between  We will expand opportunity so it reaches every person in every corner of our city  We cannot tolerate a city divided by privilege and poverty  We will protect and grow our sense of community  For it is Boston’s greatest source of strength  And we will ensure equality for all  No matter your age  race  religion  sexual orientation  No matter what  Together  we can create ONE Boston … one Boston  a hub of opportunity  community  and equality for all  The work starts now  My priorities are clear  Strengthening our economy and creating jobs  Improving public safety and stopping senseless gun violence  Ensuring our schools help every child to succeed  and  Increasing trust and transparency in city government  These are big goals  but as President Lincoln said  “The best thing about the future is that it comes ONE DAY AT A TIME ” On Day One  today  I will convene a meeting to begin to address senseless violence that scars our city  I will bring together mothers of children killed by that violence  with members of the law enforcement community who work hard to stop it  Members of the recovery community  who know too well the hard road back from drug and alcohol abuse  and how such abuse contributes to the violence and crime  And people who know what it takes to move away from a life of violence to become productive  contributing neighbors in a safe community  There were fewer murders last year   40 homicides in our city  And while that lower number is good news  and a testament to the hard work that has been done  we know  as Acting Police Commissioner Evans said the other day  40 homicides still represents 40 grieving mothers too many  And I agree  We know what works  We know there are steps we can take now  We must redouble our efforts  and recommit ourselves to the safety of every citizen in our city  We will do that today and every day I am Mayor  No parent should worry that a bullet will stop a daughter or son from coming home  No woman should be scared on our streets  No senior should be afraid in their home  And no child should be forced to live with the trauma and the indelible scars of violence  We must find a way to provide our families and our communities with the help they need when they need it  Imagine if these kids  these parents had people to help them in times of trauma  Health care professionals and community members serving as volunteers  answering the call whenever a life   and with it  a family and a neighborhood   is torn by violent crime  We have to make our communities safer to secure a future of opportunity for our kids  But that’s not all  We have to make sure every kid gets a great education  We are known the world over for our great colleges and universities  It’s time we had a world class public school system too  Every kid in every neighborhood deserves the chance for a pathway to higher education or a good career  Every kid in Boston deserves a great education that will give them the opportunity to get ahead  Tomorrow  I will begin conversations with our school committee to launch a nationwide search for the next Superintendent of the Boston Public Schools  Our acting Superintendent  John McDonough  deserves our thanks for his capable  steady leadership in a tough job   he has earned mine  I want our next superintendent to be a proven urban education leader who shares my commitment to eliminating the achievement gap  universal early education  high school reform  inclusion programs  dual language programs a new approach to school construction  and expanded  high quality career and technical training  These are goals we can reach  Madison Park High School in Roxbury already is being transformed into a world class career and technical school  by partnering with Roxbury Community College  the business community and the Building Trades  That’s the start of realizing my broader vision  I want more kids in more high schools in every neighborhood to have that kind of opportunity  that level of career and technical training  Study after study has told us that universal early education and these other changes can be transformative  They give every child a more equal chance to thrive and succeed  Yes  these things cost money   but we must find a way  Education spending is the biggest piece of our city budget  So we start with this principle  Every dollar we spend on education must be put to best and most effective use  That’s why I will work with the school committee and acting superintendent to commission a Performance Audit of our school department   a close look not just at where the money is going  but whether it is being spent most effectively and efficiently  And we can change the way Boston pays for school construction  renovation  and maintenance   another major expense  As a legislator  I supported the creation of the Massachusetts School Building Authority to ensure a fair  transparent and accountable process to make quality school buildings available to every child  Now  as Mayor  I will work to make sure Boston secures its share of equitable state funding as part of a plan to rebuild its long neglected and antiquated school buildings  We must take some kind of fresh  innovative approach when it comes to our investments in job creation and economic development  Different pieces of the economic development puzzle are spread across city government  Too often  it’s hard to fit them together  There’s duplication and confusion  It’s difficult for the city and for the businesses and workers we’re trying to help  I am committed to restructuring the Boston Redevelopment Authority  and to bringing together in a smart  rational and effective way all the parts of city government dealing with job creation and economic development  We can make Boston a leader in streamlined  transparent  and effective job and business growth  We have to make clear to everyone that Boston is open for business  That means attracting and growing new businesses and strengthening those already here   from big corporations to small start ups  It means making certain that all businesses  including minority and women owned companies  have access to opportunity  I will work to revitalize our Main Streets Program and launch Neighborhood Business Districts  which will provide wider access to city resources  We must help job creating small businesses plant themselves and grow in every neighborhood of our city  not just in some  And I am committed to permitting and licensing reforms that streamline what is now a complicated maze of rules and regulations  Permitting and licensing should protect consumers without strangling our small businesses in red tape  And we’ve got to take action to finally realize the full economic benefit of our city’s many underutilized neighborhood assets  For example  Dorchester’s Strand Theater  The Strand is part of my family’s history   a place I walked past countless times as a kid  And just recently  I began and ended my own campaign for Mayor within its storied walls  Now  as the Strand approaches its 100th anniversary  it can once again be an economic engine for the neighborhood  an education resource for our teens  and a new performance and gathering spot for our entire city  We have a responsibility to every generation  Too many of our seniors are struggling  Too many of our seniors face difficulties they can’t overcome on their own  It’s time we really understand the problems they face so we can find solutions  We will release and examine closely a new comprehensive report on Boston’s seniors  about where and how they live  employment and income  nutrition and health  mobility and language  In February  we will begin a new survey by the Boston Housing Authority  to understand the needs of seniors and the disabled living in city housing  We know we’ve got to find new options for creating more housing for seniors in the wake of deep federal budget cutbacks  And I will commit Boston to joining the Alzheimer’s Early Detection Alliance  We will release a Blueprint for Action for the city  to raise awareness through education and outreach  and to connect those with the disease to the resources they need  For me  this is personal  My grandmother and our family suffered from this disease  All of this   everything we aim to accomplish  every dream we work to realize   requires the faith and trust of the people of Boston  We must increase transparency and make clear that Boston’s interests come first  Always  I will set tough  new ethics standards for my staff  new rules against conflicts of interest and new requirements for wider and more detailed annual personal financial disclosures  I will work to create a new city Ethics Committee so we can establish and enforce stronger ethics rules and more disclosure for city elected officials and senior level employees  Faith and trust are earned  We must do what it takes to earn both  from the people we serve  Together we have much to do  And a lot of hard work ahead  It’s appropriate that we start today here at my alma mater  at the Conte Forum  home to the Boston College basketball and hockey teams  Whether on the hardwood or the ice  this is a place where teamwork matters and makes a difference  This is a place where you win when you work together   even when it means taking a few elbows under the basket or in front of the net  I stand here today profoundly grateful to the team that brought me to this moment and to all the people of Boston I am honored to serve  To my family  my mother who stands here proudly  and my father  who is in my thoughts every day  and to my brother Johnny  Your love  your unrelenting belief in me   through sickness and health  through hard times and good  helped me understand that anything is possible  To Lorrie and her daughter  Lauren  who believed in me every step of the way   thank you for standing by me as

off site in Grove Hall with two inoperable firearms he wanted to hand over in exchange for the $100 gift cards that were being offered “I was  like  ‘This guy seems out of place ’ u2009’’ recalled Jorge Martinez  a well known antiviolence crusader in the area and head of the nonprofit Project RIGHT on Blue Hill Avenue  “I asked him where he was from  And he said he was from Maine ” nMartinez sent the man on his way  without taking the guns or giving him gift cards  But the episode is a stark illustration of what specialists say is now a widely accepted failing of buyback programs  Even when they bring in impressive stockpiles of firearms  they rarely get the ones most sought by law enforcement  “Unfortunately  there is no compelling evidence that gun buyback programs are an effective crime fighting tool or that they reduce the rates of crime ’’ said Jon Vernick  co director of Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research  nGrasping for solutions to a wave of shooting violence this year  punctuated last week by the death of a 9 year old boy who was shot  allegedly by his 14 year old brother in Mattapan  Mayor Martin J  Walsh said the city would launch a to help get guns off the street   The city has used buyback programs in the past and was considering one for several weeks before the latest shooting death  Gun buyback programs have been a staple of urban crime fighting measures across the country for more than two decades  but a growing body of research has concluded they are ineffective  at best  A 2003 study of buyback programs nationwide by Anthony Braga  a crime specialist who is now a professor at Rutgers University  found that the programs had no impact on gun crime or gun related injuries  and that the programs do not target guns highly likely to be used in violence       The programs have nonetheless remained popular  particularly in times of crisis   After the December 2012 massacre of 26 people — 20 of them young children — at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown  Conn   many cities have been stepping up buyback programs or launching new ones  specialists said  Cincinnati held three gun buybacks last year  In Tucson  Ariz   police collected about 200 firearms in exchange for about $10 000 in gift cards  Seattle — where a study concluded that a 1992 buyback failed to significantly reduce the frequency of firearm injuries  deaths  or crimes — staged another buyback in January 2013  Police called it a success  saying they collected 712 weapons  including a Stinger missile launcher tube and three Street Sweeper shotguns Some specialists have criticized such efforts as little more than public relations ploys  letting law enforcement officials display a cache of weapons to give an impression of action in the face of crime  But Vernick  of the Center for Gun Policy and Research  said buyback programs are not without benefits  They can help raise awareness about guns and mobilize advocates and residents to work with police  he said  He also said the programs do usually net some guns used in crimes  though typically very few In Boston  the first buybacks came during the crime waves of the 1990s  when the city offered $50 for each gun  From 1993 through 1996  police collected 2 800 guns The program was abandoned after violent crime fell and critics  including a Harvard analysis  blasted the buyback  saying the guns recovered bared little resemblance of the firearms used to commit crime A report of Boston buyback programs published last year in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine noted  “Licensed gun dealers from the suburbs used the event to clear their inventories of second hand ﬁrearms that were worth less than the $50 incentive ’’ As violence surged in the mid 2000s  Mayor Thomas M  Menino restarted the program vowing to avoid problems that plagued the first program  Using $25 000 of the city’s money  Menino offered a $100 gift card to Target instead of cash  had eight drop off sites at church and neighborhood centers  and launched a massive marketing campaign that included billboard ads and Internet podcasts The program netted 1 000 guns  police said  The Suffolk District Attorney’s Office later said none of the firearms could be traced to killings In Roxbury  Mattapan  and Dorchester  neighborhoods where 70 percent of the city’s gun violence occurs  many are skeptical of a new round of buybacks   “I really don’t think it’s a good idea  because this is not going to get the kids who really have the guns ’’ said the Rev  Vernard Coulter  who works closely with teenagers involved in street gangs  “A lot of these kids are carrying guns because they are afraid  and they protecting themselves  They are saying  ‘I must have a gun on me if someone is going to threaten me and my family ’ u2009”Complicating any effort to retrieve guns used for crime  some said  is that gun holders often employ juveniles with unblemished records or recruit their girlfriends or mothers to either purchase the firearms or hide them “These are guns that are hidden in stairwells that moms and girlfriends are hiding for their boyfriends  for their husbands  for their sons ” said Nancy Robinson  who runs Citizens for Safety  an antigun trafficking group that is working to educate women about the consequences of holding weapons for their mates  Police Commissioner William B  Evans said he is considering new strategies to make a new buyback more successful than those held in the past  He said a key target will be mothers who suspect their children might be hiding a gun and legal gun owners who have unused firearms in their homes that could be stolen   nHe  nsaid the buyback will be a small piece of the department’s overall gun strategy  The program will include new features  such as an anonymous tip line for people to report guns  Initial plans call for installing kiosks at police stations  where residents can drop off weapons  no questions asked  he said   Evans has also discussed increasing the amount of the gift cards to $200 to $300  Evans said the department is looking to private companies to raise funds for the program   “The community’s got to buy into this ’’ Evans said  recalling the 9 year old who was killed Friday  Jan Marcos Pena  “Based on what happened to that Pena boy  it should rally everybody to the danger of having a gun         in the house ”Martinez  of Project RIGHT  said he has been advising Evans on improving the program  For the program to work  Martinez said it must offer more money  require that only Bostonians participate  and better track and test the guns Martinez said the program can work if done properly and he pushed back at critics who say the buyback programs are ineffective   “Every gun you get off the street is a small victory ’’ he said  “You go to the family of that 14 year old and ask them if it would have made a difference if we’d gotten that gun off the street ’’ n', '2014_886')",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

schools  fired and or hired new coaches The NFL will be there soon enough  With only four weeks left in the season  teams are starting to make final determinations about whether to fire or retain their head coaches and general managers on “Black Monday ” the day after the regular season ends  t nThe NFL averages 7 8 new coaching hires almost every season  and league insiders expect a similar number this year The divorce between and the 49ers is viewed as a “lock ” according to one industry source — the only issue is whether the 49ers try to trade Harbaugh  likely for mid round draft picks  or if the sides just part ways  Harbaugh has offsets in his contract  “A guy like Harbaugh probably already has things discussed ” the source said Harbaugh won’t be unemployed for long  If he wants to stay in the Bay Area  then a move to the Raiders is obvious  Harbaugh also has tremendous respect for   who gave him his start in coaching   nand  are also locks to be fired  and the Jets and Giants are expected to be hot on Harbaugh’s trail  as well The entire AFC East  other than New England  is on the hot seat  If the Dolphins fade down the stretch and miss the playoffs for the sixth straight season  owner is expected to fire  after three seasons  Ross loves Harbaugh  too   And  might not survive if the Bills don’t make the playoffs — new ownership  in this case and  often likes to hire its own people  nis likely safe in Tennessee despite a 2 10  nseason  and  five year contract with Washington will likely buy him some time But there have been several one and done head coaches in recent years           and one real possibility isin Tampa Bay  with the Buccaneers at 2 10 and looking disorganized on Sundays  “It’s one thing to lose games ” an insider said  “but to give up 35 points in a quarter ”Patience is running thin in Jacksonville  where is 6 22 in two years and his defense has been ranked 28th in points allowed both years   nis squarely on the hot seat with the Bears at 5 8 and showing no improvement  “I think it’s over for him ” one source said Carolina’s  who signed an extension through 2017 in January  is the prime “surprise” firing candidate with the Panthers set to turn in their third losing season in four years under Rivera  And Atlanta’s can start packing his bags — the only question is if team owner ndoes a complete housecleaning or keeps GM for one more make or break season “Blank is a real trigger finger guy  and he’s been sitting in the press conferences  which is never a good sign ” a league source said As for the GMs  only two were fired last year  Miami and Tampa Bay  but insiders expect around five this year Someone has to take responsibility for the mess in Tennessee  and it likely will be   whose roster is in shambles after three years on the job  is almost certain to be fired in Oakland  is very much in jeopardy in Buffalo  so is in Chicago  and Carolina’s   a Mattapan native  is no lock to survive the offseason  The Jets’ is also on very shaky ground  “When something like this happens  everyone burns ” a source said about the Jets’ disastrous season So other than Harbaugh and potentially   again   who are the hot coaching candidates this year One of the candidates who will be in highest demand is Broncos offensive coordinator   36  who turned down all interviews last year as he helped the Broncos prepare for the Super Bowl  But Gase is better prepared this year and is all but certain to land a head coaching job this time around Another top candidate is Eagles offensive coordinator  the Browns’ head coach in 2011 12  Many league insiders believe Shurmur wasn’t given a fair shake by Browns owner   and his stock has been boosted by his association with and the performance of  in Philly One interesting name to watch is Chargers offensive coordinator  who has done impressive work with and can command a room  Reich  a former Bills quarterback  could be the perfect fit in Buffalo to continue the feel good vibes generated with the Pegulas taking over and keeping the team in town  “Frank Reich in Buffalo is a can’t miss ” a league source said The 49ers will look for a mellower coach  and will consider promoting defensive coordinator  “They just want someone with less noise ” a league source said   will get interviews if he wants them — he certainly made a lot of mistakes in Denver  but he is still only 38 —  although a Patriots Super Bowl run could complicate matters  Browns OC  is a name that will pop up  given the work he has done with a backup quarterback     a shoddy offensive line  and no  for the first 10 games this year  but at 34 might still be a couple years away from a head job  Three defensive coordinators to watch are Seattle’s   Denver’s   who went 68 71 in nine seasons as head coach in Jacksonville  and Arizona’s   who could finally land a head coaching job if he has improved his interview skills  Bears defensive coordinator and Giants defensive coordinator will also be considered for interviews On the GM side  the top candidates to watch are Chiefs director of player personnel  Steelers director of football administration   Patriots GM   Jaguars director of pro personnel   Giants vice president of player evaluation   and Titans VP of football operations and Boston born   n ndecision to take the Patriots directly from Wisconsin to California for a week of practice leading up to Sunday night’s game against the Chargers certainly made sense from a logistical standpoint But it’s also a costly trip  tax wise  for Belichick    and the rest of the Patriots’ high earners The state of California is one of the strictest in enforcing the “jock tax” — taxing professional athletes who come to the state to play games  In 2012  California collected $216 8 million just from taxing out of state professional athletes By bringing the Patriots to California for seven days of work instead of the customary three — East Coast teams typically fly out to West Coast games on Friday — Belichick subjected himself and his players to a much larger tax bill  Massachusetts only has one state income tax rate on wages  5 2 percent   but in California  owner of the nation’s highest income tax rate  the Patriots’ high earners will be ta  at a whopping 12 3 percent  The Patriots who are Massachusetts residents do get a state tax credit  but even still  going to California early resulted in a four  and even five figure tax increase for many Patriots   a senior manager and tax consultant in the Sports   Entertainment Group at O’Connor Davies in New Jersey   SportsTaxMan   helped us compare the tax hits for certain players based on three days vs  seven days of work in California  After crunching the numbers  he determined that   who is most likely a Florida resident and makes $12 million this year  paid $30 123 in additional taxes last week than he would have paid had the Patriots flown out on Friday Brady  who is likely a Massachusetts resident and makes $17 million this year  $2 million in salary  $15 million in deferred signing bonus payments   saw an increase of $22 259    likely a Florida resident  who makes $3 815 million this year  paid $8 299 extra last week  Belichick  rumored to make about $7 5 million and likely a Massachusetts resident  paid $9 489 extra The young players making league minimum salary  however  weren’t affected too much  Defensive tackle   for example  is making a total of $560 000 this year  and saw an increase of only $332 last week Of course  a win Sunday night against the Chargers will make it money well spent  n ndisappointing rookie season came to an end last week when the Texans placed him on injured reserve and announced he will have a second surgery on his right knee  Clowney  the No  1 overall draft pick who arrived in the NFL with much fanfare  played in just four games this season and finished with seven tackles and zero sacks  nClowney is hardly the only 2014 high draft pick to have a disappointing season  though  The top 10 from last May’s draft is filled with unmet expectations  Only three of the top 10 picks have excelled  No  7 of Tampa Bay  890 yards and eight touchdowns   No  9 of Minnesota  70 tackles  four sacks  two forced fumbles   and No  5  of Oakland  60 tackles  one sack  one forced fumble   nNo  2 pick didn’t start for the Rams until Week 6  and has allowed four sacks and 12 combined hits hurries at left guard and left tackle  No  3 has nine touchdown passes  15 interceptions  and a 2 10 record for the Jaguars  No  4  has been decent for Buffalo  with 51 catches for 695 yards and five touchdowns  but the Bills traded two first round picks for the right to draft him and didn’t even wind up with the best receiver in the class No  6 has allowed six sacks and 33 combined hits hurries for the Falcons  and is ranked dead last among all offensive tackles by Pro Football Focus  No  8   the first cornerback off the board  has zero interceptions and just two starts for the Browns  And No  10 has just 19 catches for 171 yards and a touchdown for the Lions  n nThe NFL has an exciting crop of young  dynamic tight ends       and   among others The dean of athletic tight ends  San Diego’s   was asked on Wednesday which was his favorite tight end to watch  His answer was way outside the box “My favorite at this point is the boy in Miami ” he said  referring to the Dolphins’   “He’s really good  and people don’t talk about him ”Clay  a sixth round pick in 2011  is having a down season with 39 catches for 346 yards and two touchdowns  But he had a breakout season last year with 69 catches for 759 yards and six touchdowns  and at 6 feet 3 inches and 255 pounds is one of the smallest but fastest tight ends in the league “He plays in a division where you don’t hear much about him ” Gates said  “To me  what separates him from a lot of guys is his ability to run after the catch  He’s very unique in that aspect ” nAnother week  two more injury scandals for the NFL  In Dallas  has been playing with two small fractures in his back  but on Thursday he let it slip that he’s been playing with a broken rib for almost two months  The NFL said on Friday that it is investigating why Romo’s rib injury hasn’t been listed on the Cowboys’ injury report And in New York  linebacker  formerly of Boston College  was on the field for the final snap of the game despite clearly suffering a concussion in the fourth quarter  Herzlich became the third Giants player in the last five weeks to remain in the game after a concussion  joiningand   The Giants made no mention of Herzlich’s concussion on Sunday  yet he missed practice Wednesday and Thursday and is questionable for Sunday’s game against the Titans  nThe NFL whiffed on indefinite suspension but should have a better outcome in appeal of his six game suspension  Unlike with Rice  it’s hard to view Peterson’s case as double punishment  given that he was paid in full during his 10 week exile on the commissioner’s exempt list — almost $7 million  The six game suspension recently handed down is on par with the league’s new policies  and Peterson can apply for reinstatement in April if he behaves         Couldn’t have imagined a more disappointing 2014 season for   who missed the offseason and most of training camp following foot surgery  was a healthy scratch for seven games  caught just three passes for 38 yards all season  then was put on IR last week after pulling his hamstring in his first game back in almost two months  The Patriots have no incentive to cut Dobson during the summer  and they’ll give him a chance to make the team again next year  But if their 2013 second round pick doesn’t perform in training camp  they won’t hesitate to cut him         With eight more catches  the Texans’ nwill become the 10th player in NFL history with 1 000  If he does it Sunday  he will tie for the fewest games to reach the milestone  167   And the Seahawks’  is one way away from tying Atlanta’s for most wins in a quarterback’s first three seasons  33   n“I don’t think our pro offense would work at the college level ” — Eagles coach

that measure everything from shootings to building permits  using management techniques often found in business settings to infuse city government with new urgency Every stop on Walsh’s daily schedule is now automatically plotted  non a digital screen in the mayor’s office showing how often he has visited each Boston neighborhood in the past 30 days  t nPothole crews are using more smartphones to increase productivity  and residents now receive photos to prove that tasks were completed  One image shows the freshly patched asphalt and the other is a portrait of the public works crew that did the work In a 90 minute interview last week  Walsh unveiled what he described as his “thriving  innovative  and healthy” vision for Boston  an exhaustive list of issues he hopes to tackle in the three remaining years of his term  His administration plans to build new digital tools to regularly track progress toward individual goals  such as dramatically boosting housing construction  rezoning swaths of Boston to increase economic opportunity  or eliminating superfluous licenses for jukeboxes and pool tables The agenda Walsh described was heavy on analytical tools but lacked concrete details about how he plans to address the broader issues he cited  such as increasing economic inclusion  He also did not provide specifics about how he plans to pay for new initiatives  including his campaign promise to expand prekindergarten classes so that all 4 year olds would have a seat But he said the emphasis on using digital tools to track the administration’s progress will help Boston become “the first 21st century city in America ”“I can make all the announcements that I want and have all the speeches at the Chamber of Commerce and the State of the City and talk about my vision and great plans ” Walsh said  “But it is really making sure that we follow through on them  If we truly want to make that jump from the 20th to the 21st century  u2009        We have to hit the benchmarks ”Walsh  who requested last week’s sit down with Globe reporters  described his transition from a state legislator to chief executive of a large  complex city that began when he took office in January  Walsh said he began feeling more at ease in his new role about two months into his tenure and his comfort has grown with each passing day Walsh acknowledged that he had remained in the shadow of his predecessor  Thomas M  Menino  Boston’s longest serving mayor  who after 20 years in office had almost become synonymous with the city  When Menino died late last month  Walsh was sitting in his City Hall office and it hit home “When I got the phone call I sat down and thought  ‘I’m the mayor ’ u2009” Walsh said  “He was always kind of there  u2009      He’s such a big figure out there in the community ”After taking office  Walsh faced a mayor’s broad portfolio  the shooting death of a 9 year old Mattapan boy  a showdown over casinos  the deaths of two firefighters  and union contracts  Walsh noted that he also had to prepare for the one year anniversary of the Boston Marathon bombings and for Menino’s funeral  n“I learned trial by fire early on ” Walsh said  “I think we’ve done a fair job of governing in Boston so far ”In the interview  the mayor also revealed that a few weeks ago he met for the first time with casino magnate Steve Wynn  whose company was recently awarded a license to building a gambling resort in Everett  The administration has been critical of the casino  which will be near the Boston city line “He reached out to me ” Walsh said  “We had a good first conversation ’’ nWalsh also announced that the city’s round the clock hot line will soon be transformed from its 10 digit telephone number to 311  a system used in other urban centers  A new digital initiative dubbed “Street Cred” will soon be launched to encourage civic participation by allowing users to earn points for volunteering or reporting broken street lights  unplowed streets  and overflowing garbage cans When he is up for reelection in three years  Walsh said  his most significant accomplishments will still be works in progress  He described a “strong infrastructure” to improve education and said that by then Boston would be in the second year of a master plan for public school buildings  Construction must be under way on a “sufficient number” of units of workforce housing  Walsh said  adding when pressed for specifics  “I don’t have a number today  but in the thousands ”The city will also be preparing to implement universal prekindergarten  Walsh said  with a goal of having seats for all children by 2018  the year after the next mayoral election  In New York City  Mayor Bill de Blasio made the same campaign pledge and universal prekindergarten started in September after state lawmakers agreed to fund the initiative Walsh said he plans to appeal to the state for funding  “If not  we’re going to have to take  money  from

municipal officials educated at Harvard and MIT  Walsh’s chief of staff  Daniel Arrigg Koh  and Boston’s chief information officer  Jascha Franklin Hodge  The third was Michael Goldman  an outside communications consultant whose political roots date to the 1970s and the first administration of former governor Michael S  Dukakis Under Menino  the city used data in an effort called “Boston About Results ” The initiative tracked more than 200 performance metrics that included everything from employee overtime to library card usage  the number of trees planted to violent crime  The data were regularly analyzed by top city officials and reports were made public every three months Walsh’s goal is to change the culture at City Hall by infusing all levels of government with a data driven approach  according to Koh  One Cabinet meeting a month will be dedicated to reviewing the data  and top officials will be required to submit reports to show progress toward each of Walsh’s goals  The mayor said the data would be made public “The idea of people really thinking at all levels of government about how we measure things quantitatively is novel ” Koh said  “But I think people are really excited about it ”As an example  he pointed to Melissa Pagan  supervisor of veterans’ services  Pagan’s department hears from veterans across the city and employees track calls by neighborhood “I input all the information and it goes zooming up to the mayor’s office to his big screen ” Pagan said Focusing on collecting and analyzing data is part of the new administration s effort to manage a city workforce with more than 18 000 employees and 20 different departments “If we built this correctly  the measures that we are talking about translate into real impact for people of this city  That is the goal ” said Franklin Hodge  the chief information officer For the mayor  the push to drive his agenda with data is an attempt to show tangible progress on the array of complex problems facing Boston “I want to be able to look back three years from now and say  ‘OK this is what we spoke about when we first came into office  And this is where we are today ’ u2009’’ Walsh said  “The biggest

rushed over the dangerously decayed and newly condemned Long Island Bridge in early October  Medications  journals  and plates of food that had just been warmed were all left behind  There seemed no time to waste  nBut there had been plenty of time — days  months  years  decades  in fact — in which the structural hazards of the bridge grew increasingly obvious  and city officials did little beyond patchwork fixes to address them  a Globe review has found   t nInspection reports as early as 2007 had identified corrosion that was eating away at large sections of the structure and weakening its gusset plates — the key joint connectors that ultimately triggered the closure  In 2010  another inspection of the plates found “advanced deterioration including loss of section and corrosion holes ” Just this summer  an e mail sent among some city officials reported that the bridge had begun to buckle  Yet  when the bridge was finally deemed unsafe for travel on the afternoon of Oct  8  the city had no emergency evacuation plan in place — and no plan for where to house those who relied on the island’s shelter The Globe review also found that some city officials had known for days that the bridge faced the likelihood of imminent closure but did not pass on warnings to the mayor’s office or the organizations operating on the island  Given more time  city leaders and advocates for the homeless could have arranged a more orderly exit and identified alternative shelters for the vulnerable population as winter’s chill closed in   n“When we were first told we had to leave  we didn’t know the reason ’’ said Jonathan Scott  president of Victory Programs  which served homeless women in recovery on the island  “It was only until the women were on the bridge that we were told we were being evacuated because the bridge was condemned ”Mayor Martin J  Walsh defended the bridge’s sudden closing as a safe and necessary precaution — “I was not willing to risk the possibility of disaster for one more night” — but acknowledged that he was not aware of some key facts when he made the decision He was unaware that the city’s Public Health Commission did not have an evacuation plan in place  Walsh said  and that the only way to get the residents and staff off the island was over the bridge that had just been condemned   n“Looking back on it now  I probably would have done a little different situation  I know people drove off the island ’’ Walsh said  “I would have kept them on the island and barged them out ”On Oct  6  consultants hired to inspect the bridge laid out a scenario for the city’s chief engineer  Para Jayasinghe  that included “the possibility of the closure of the bridge ”But neither Jayasinghe nor his boss  Public Works Department Commissioner Michael Dennehy  notified the mayor about the possibility of a closure until well after 3 p m  on Oct  8  setting off the mad  scramble to evacuate the island as darkness fell The homeless  addicts in recovery  and staff who cared for them were given just a few hours to leave And the only way to the mainland was over the decrepit bridge  nBuilt in 1951  the steel truss bridge is a two lane causeway — nearly two thirds of a mile long — that serves as the sole connection between the mainland and Long Island  The island  which is part of Boston but attached to Quincy’s Moon Island via the bridge  has long been a refuge for some of the city’s neediest residents  first as the site of an almshouse  then an infectious disease hospital that was converted in 1983 to the city’s largest homeless shelter  That same year  the Public Health Commission also began housing detox programs for drug addicts on the island Bridges constructed at that time were typically built to last about 50 years  according to experts  As the end of the Long Island Bridge’s life span neared  then Mayor Thomas M  Menino grappled with whether to overhaul the structure or use the money to fund other city services  In the end he decided to retain the shelter and other facilities on the island but limit traffic on the bridge and restrict public access  Police were deployed to guard the bridge’s gates The Long Island Bridge  which is owned by the city and maintained by the Public Works Department  is the only bridge in Boston not under the state’s jurisdiction  the state has no oversight  nor any responsibility to help pay for its upkeep  Between 1990 and 2010  the bridge underwent six rehabilitations  at the cost of tens of millions of dollars  according to inspection reports Every two years  a city contracted consulting firm  TranSystems Corp   inspected the bridge using federal safety standards as a guide  even though such inspections were not required  nThen in 2007  a highway bridge in Minnesota collapsed  killing 13 people — a failure blamed on its gusset plates  Numbering in the hundreds on a large bridge  the steel plates are typically bolted  riveted  or welded to connection points  and serve as critical reinforcements to joints on the structure  For years  under federal guidelines  the condition of gusset plates had not been fully analyzed when determining how much weight a bridge could withstand  But after the Minnesota bridge collapse  the government adopted guidelines that put more scrutiny on the vital connectors After an inspection in 2010  TranSystems consultants identified several gusset plates on the Long Island Bridge in need of repairs  A Sept  9  2010  letter to city officials noted several areas where gusset plates had “advanced deterioration  including loss of section and corrosion holes ”But city officials have said only one of those areas was repaired Documents show that the city spent most of its repair money over the last decade tending to the most urgent emergencies as they arose  leaving other areas to languish  According to Jayasinghe  the city has spent about $13 million since 2004 on repairs “When it comes to bridges  we spend the money that needs to be spent ” Jayasinghe said in an interview  nIn 2012  the city determined the bridge needed more than $15 million in repairs  some of that work had been scheduled to begin this fall  nThe series of events that led to the hurried exodus on Oct  8 began with the state’s adoption of the most recent federal bridge safety guidelines in February  The city began using those guidelines — which include the stricter protocols for gusset plates — in the fall  as it began a regularly scheduled inspection of Long Island Bridge  In the months before the closure  the bridge increasingly showed signs of its age  the June e mail reported that the bridge had buckled by approximately 3 inches  Another report this summer indicated thatdeep potholes in the bridge surface were damaging the undercarriages of the MBTA buses that used the bridge   As the inspection began in September  the alarm bells grew louder  n“Field reviewed the current bridge conditions yesterday and confirmed the fact that the bridge is deteriorating faster than expected ’’ Jayasinghe wrote in an e mailto Dennehy and other city employees on Oct  1 On Oct  6  Jayasinghe was warned that the bridge could very well need to be closed  TranSystem consultants  who were conducting the review  told him that some gusset plates had a load rating of zero tons — meaning it would be unsafe to let even one car drive across Abolhassan Astaneh Asl  a professor of structural and bridge engineering at the University of California Berkeley who reviewed bridge’s inspection reports at the Globe’s request  wondered why more maintenance wasn’t done earlier to address the deterioration of the gusset plates  especially since they had been noted in inspections for years  “It takes years for a gusset plate to lose a whole area so that it’s at a zero rating ” he said  nAfter the consultants warned Jayasinghe that the bridge could be unsafe   the engineer sought the advice of the state’s bridge experts  They met two days later  at around 1 30 p m  on Oct  8  in the state Department of Transportation building to go over the inspectors’ findings At around 3 p m   Jayasinghe called Dennehy  the public works commissioner  alerting him that the state experts agreed with the TranSystems consultants that the bridge should close At about 3 50 p m   one of the consultants got more specific — and more urgent — in an  e mail sent to Jayasinghe   “This closure should happen by the end of the day ” the consultant wrote Dennehy  who was on the fifth floor of City Hall when he received the call from Jayasinghe  and Kate Norton  the mayor’s press secretary  said they bolted to Walsh’s office  where the mayor was in a meeting  Dennehy said he was concerned about the 300 people who were on the island and another 400 who were  at that moment  on buses winding through Boston heading to the bridge to get to the island’s overnight shelter Dennehy said he stood outside the mayor’s office while Norton caught Walsh’s eye and signaled that they needed to speak with him immediately  Walsh came to the doorway and asked what was going on  “Long Island Bridge ’’ Dennehy said  That was enough to get the mayor’s full attention  he and Dennehy had been talking about the bridge for months and had feared this day would come  “It was on his radar ’’ Dennehy said  “And he knew the seriousness of it          He was not surprised ”“I said  ‘We need to shut the bridge down ’ u200a u2009’’ Walsh recounted    nWord had to go out to the guards at the gate  crews had to be assembled to block the bridge’s entrance  and space was needed for people to stay that night  Dennehy then gathered other key Cabinet officials — including health and human services chief Felix G  Arroyo and emergency management chief Rene Fielding — near his office on the seventh floor  n“There was anxiety ’’ Dennehy said  “When you get that report from the state that says shut something down in five hours  yes — your juices are flowing for sure ”It’s unclear why city officials believed the bridge had to be closed within five hours  Dennehy initially told the Globe — and has said as much at public meetings — that the five hour evacuation window came from state officials  But the state has been adamant that it has no oversight over the city owned bridge and that it did not order its closing or the evacuation of the island and only offered an opinion at the city’s request  Norton said that officials from the Public Health Commission and public works were responsible for setting the five hour evacuation deadline  but she did not know who gave the order  nThe Public Health Commission had begun devising an evacuation plan as early as January  in the event of a major emergency or prolonged bridge repairs  but records indicate that 10 months later  none was in place  According to a draft report titled “Long Island Bridge Emergency Closure Plan ” dated January 2014  the city was exploring ferry service to and from the island three times daily to transport clients  staff  and limited supplies in case the bridge had to be shut down   The week before the closure  15 officials from several city agencies  including the Public Health Commission and the Police Department  met to discuss the plan and had many unanswered questions In meeting notes  officials appeared to be unclear about their options for moving people during an evacuation “Need to speak with someone with specialized knowledge  marine engineer  and ensure that transportation options really are viable ” the notes on the ferry plan state   nSome of the social service programs on the island had plans to “shelter in place” if the bridge closed temporarily for any reason — snowstorms  a catastrophe  or major construction  They had done it in the past  hunkering down until the bridge was cleared for travel  They had hoped to do it again  Some of the programs had enough food and resources to last for a week or two  others had backup generators But on Oct  8  they were told to leave In an interview with the Globe  Dennehy said he believed the bridge was used for the evacuation because the e mail from TranSystems said the closure should happen “by the end of the day ”Dennehy also acknowledged that he knew on Oct  6 a closure could be imminent but said he did not want to raise unnecessary alarm “The intent was not to create a nine alarm fire when there wasn’t one ” Dennehy said  But officials from some of the programs on the island said earlier warnings would have helped “Two days would have been better than five hours ’’ said Stephanie Paauwe  director of development for Volunteers of America  which serves clients on Long Island  “If we had more time  things would have been different ” Walsh said he was not aware of the Oct  6 warning from the consultants until asked about it by a reporter   He voiced dismay that the Public Health Commission did not have evacuation plans in place prior to his taking office in January “I’m just finding out about that now ’’ the mayor said  “Even so  this bridge has been failing for seven years  In some cases  there should have been major repairs on this bridge before Oct  8  before Oct  6  before August  before Jan  1 ”He said his team made a series of “tough judgments” on Oct  8  and he stands by his decisions  “It’s a terrible situation that we had to shut the bridge down ’’ Walsh said  “Everyone can Monday morning quarterback and tell me what I did wrong or what I didn’t do wrong  All I know is that thank God  no one got hurt  The bridge is shut down and we are taking actions to make the fixes and repairs ”  nOn Friday  the city began soliciting bids from contractors to demolish the top portion of the bridge  down to the supports  which will remain  Work will include disconnecting the utility lines that carry water and power to the island  Demolition is expected to be completed by the end of April  city officials said  Walsh’s administration has put aside about $35 million in a five year capital plan for the bridge but has not explained how the city will raise the other $45 million needed to reconstruct it The city has also allocated $9 million for a new bridge design  with half of the money coming from the state’s Transportation Department  The design process could take about 12 months  officials said  But Walsh still faces a critical question  “Is the bridge worth saving ”The mayor has said he is committed to keeping the homeless shelter and recovery programs on the island Philanthropist Jack Connors on Friday renewed his pledge to continue Camp Harbor View  a program for Boston children  on the island next summer  He said he hopes to get the same number of children — 450 in July and 450 in August — and the camp’s 90 member staff onto the island using the Bay State Cruises ferry service  The camp will also have access to the Police Department’s Harbor Patrol speedboats in case of emergencies  said Sharon McNally  executive director of the Camp Harbor View Foundation  Meanwhile  social services agencies that serve vulnerable clients are seeking alternative locations  The city is exploring several options for a temporary facility to serve as a long term shelter  It plans to restore two Mattapan buildings as sites for some of the recovery programs  Walsh said he is doing what he can to address the crisis and return a sense of normalcy to the displaced “I know that people are angry and that people are upset ’’ Walsh said  “I’m certainly upset  about  displacing the programs  I’ve spent my whole career fighting for these programs as a legislator  And certainly as mayor of the city of Boston  I am more passionate now because I have a little more say

stranded as panicked parents and school officials scrambled to find alternative transportation School officials were bracing for the possibility of more late buses Tuesday  and announced that the MBTA would be free for students  t “Families should prepare alternate arrangements to bring students to and from school Tuesday if necessary ’’ the school department said in a statement On Monday  the missing buses affected students who were heading to 15 charter schools and 11 special education programs that have already begun the new school year  in advance of the Sept  4 opening day for most Boston public schools Thirteen of the approximately 120 routes were completely uncovered  leaving about 400 students without rides  Overall  22 percent of buses were late  including 7 percent that were more than a half hour late  according to the Boston School Department  Nearly 3 000 students were slated to ride the buses The disruption unfolded amid tense negotiations over a new contract for school bus drivers and raised concerns among parents and city leaders that the drivers could strike  Last fall  bus drivers staged a surprise one day work stoppage that left thousands of students deserted at their bus stops  “Our kids are trying to get to school and they are playing games ” said Devita McConnell  whose 12 year old daughter attends the Brooke Charter School in Roslindale  “That’s a problem for me ”McConnell and her daughter waited nearly a half hour for a bus in Mattapan but ultimately gave up  McConnell instead drove her daughter and three other students to school before heading to work Although the school system managed to get all bus routes covered for the afternoon through a combination of regular bus drivers  supervisors  and backup drivers  officials remained worried about Tuesday morning’s runs  Even more schools are scheduled to be open  requiring 175 buses  but by Monday evening school officials had only 110 drivers lined up Mayor Martin J  Walsh at an afternoon press conference expressed concern about a possible strike before the opening of all schools next week  Walsh said he had heard some drivers are continuing to object to the termination of four union leaders last year after the work stoppage  “But that’s no reason not to pick kids up on the corner ’’ Walsh said  “That’s no reason to have a threat of a looming strike over our head ’’Walsh said the city has been told that the drivers would give 72 hours’ notice before any strike Signs emerged that there might be problems getting the buses on the road last week when hundreds of drivers refused to bid on routes for the upcoming school year — an annual process that essentially enables drivers with the most seniority to get priority on the routes they want  school officials said Instead the drivers “occupied” the main terminal  according to a Facebook page maintained by some bus driver union officials  The posting referred to the union’s “long struggle in self defense against Boston’s privatized school bus management’s concession  austerity  and union busting program  including the illegal termination of 4 top elected union officers ” Those four leaders remain on the union’s negotiating committee With few  if any  drivers bidding on the routes  Interim Superintendent John McDonough said the School Department and Transdev  the private contractor that oversees the bus yards and employs the drivers  worked out a fallback plan with the union that would enable drivers to be assigned routes Monday morning  But not enough drivers showed up  and many of those who did were late  school officials said Dumond Louis  president of the bus drivers’ union  said the union did its best to make sure all routes were covered  calling about 600 drivers to report to the bus yards “We expected a lot of them to show up  in the  morning  but unfortunately not enough of them showed up ” said Louis  noting that he covered some of the routes himself  Kate Lagreca  spokeswoman for Transdev  said the company was disappointed that the lack of bus drivers caused some students to be stranded and others delayed “We had an agreement with the union and assurances throughout the weekend that a sufficient number of drivers would report for duty this morning ” Lagreca said in a statement The school bus drivers’ union has become increasingly vocal during negotiations with Transdev to replace a contract that expired in June  Transdev  based in Lombard  Ill   recently changed its name from Veolia The union has objected to a variety of measures  including provisions that would mandate uniforms  allow the company to hold hearings on the status of employees who have been on sick leave for 12 months  and introduce language on absenteeism and tardiness that the union denounces as an attempt “to ramp up discipline ” according to a flyer the union is circulating online  nThe contract talks became more contentious in June during a rally at a Dorchester bus yard when one of the fired leaders  Steve Kirschbaum  allegedly pushed a table against a Transdev manager as Kirschbaum tried to break into an office  Kirschbaum has pleaded not guilty to charges of assault and battery with a dangerous weapon  breaking and entering  trespassing  and destruction of property McDonough called the disruption in bus service unacceptable “Shamefully  some of our students were left deserted ” he said  “I personally feel very disappointed ”The impact at Brooke Charter School was significant  co director Jon Clark said  Seventeen buses at its Roslindale  Mattapan  and East Boston campuses didn’t show up or were more than an hour late  Many parents ended up taking their children to school along with others who had been waiting for rides “We had a lot of parents upset and worried about their kids ” Clark said  “It was a huge safety issue  We are hopeful this will be resolved soon ” Carolyn Kain  chairwoman of the Boston Special Education Parent Advisory Council  said she was outraged that bus drivers would desert students at bus stops again or arrive severely late “It’s reprehensible they would pull something like this on little children and

their own behalf Pressley then stood and delivered a passionate speech  pointing to her track record representing the city and tackling what she calls contentious issues afflicting many Bostonians  Then she threw her hat in the ring  “Lord knows I do not have all the answers  but I do aim to actively seek them out by deliberation and prayer and to use my best judgment ’’ Pressley said  “Leadership is more than a mere title  It is the ability to empower people around common cause ”When Yancey asked for other contenders to address the council  Linehan remained quiet  Then  the clerk asked each councilor to say whom they would pick for the post  The eight who named Linehan  including the councilor himself  were Mark Ciommo of Allston Brighton  Timothy McCarthy  newly elected from Hyde Park  Frank Baker of Dorchester  Sal LaMattina of East Boston  and Councilors at Large Murphy  Michael Flaherty  and Michelle Wu District Councilors Matt O’Malley of West Roxbury  Josh Zakim of Mission Hill  Yancey of Mattapan  and Jackson backed Pressley’s bid  Pressley voted for herself In his acceptance speech  Linehan highlighted the experiences of the council  saying the members are skilled in governance  policy  and finance “We the council         offer this to our new mayor ’’ said Linehan  “It is my intention to work with each and every one of you to create an even better Boston City Council  We have a responsibility to those who came before us to improve this body ”His victory comes after a contentious few weeks over who would hold the highest job on the council  Linehan had been vying for the position along with O’Malley  Jackson  and  later  Pressley Controversy erupted shortly after the mayoral election when O’Malley thought he could gather seven votes to claim the presidency  He had commitments from six councilors  including McCarthy  but Wu would not commit Things began to change quickly when McCarthy decided to back Linehan  Wu pledged her support for Linehan  and Jackson jumped into the ring  although he could not secure the seven votes Many Wu supporters  angry that the councilor appeared to betray her liberal leanings by backing a colleague they perceived as conservative and from an old guard of Boston politics  blasted her on Twitter  via e mail  and in phone calls Wu stayed firm  She released a statement saying Linehan was the best person for the job Over the weekend   nthe local chapter of the NAACP sent out e mail blasts urging people to press their councilors to back Pressley  not Linehan On Monday  when Wu voted for Linehan  some audience members in the council chambers gallery grunted  And then there was applause In his speech  Linehan recalled the wisdom of his mother  Edie  “She said  ‘Bill  nothing worthwhile comes easy ’ u2009” he said  “It’s ever so true ”When the voting was over  Linehan said he felt humbled to be president  He promised that he will build on the work he has done and continue to advocate for

 said Thursday that as he enters his final months in office he is prepared to grant the first pardons of his tenure He is considering the cases of three men who have all been out of prison 15 to 25 years and have had clean records for decades  according to records filed with the Advisory Board of Pardons  Two of the three have drug records  and one was convicted of assault  t n“I’m ready  and I think the Governor’s Council  which has to approve them  is ready  within bounds ” Patrick said during his monthly appearance on WGBH FM  Boston Public Radio A state advisory board has asked him to pardon the men  which effectively would expunge their records If any of the pardons are granted  they would be the first since 2002  when acting Governor Jane Swift pardoned seven people whose records included offenses such as marijuana possession  drug dealing  check forgery  and driving with a suspended license  Her successor  Republican Governor Mitt Romney  issued no pardons or commutations  a separate action that allows early release from prison   a fact he proclaimed proudly as he sought the Republican presidential nomination in 2008 For Patrick  who swept into office in 2007 as a liberal Democrat and a former staff lawyer of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund  the pardons would come when there is less risk of political blowback  say political analysts Patrick is leaving office in January and has said he will enter the private sector “It would almost seem cruel and insensitive for a governor to go through an entire term and never reconsider decisions that may have in the long run appeared to be unjust and overly harsh ” said Jeffrey M  Berry  professor of political science at Tufts University  “These sound like very safe pardons and ones that are unlikely to create any kind of controversy  These are not bold steps designed to make a judgment on the judicial system ”During the 2006 governor’s race  Patrick was attacked by his Republican opponent  Kerry Healey  for writing letters to the Parole Board seeking the release of Benjamin LaGuer  a convicted rapist serving a life sentence  He was not released Healey ran a hard hitting television ad highlighting a case Patrick won as a Legal Defense Fund lawyer in 1985  when he successfully halted the execution of Carl Ray Songer  who was convicted of murdering a Florida state trooper  That case had provoked an outcry in Florida and anger from the trooper’s family But among advocates for prisoners’ rights and critics of mandatory sentences for drug offenses  there was hope that Patrick’s tenure would usher in more pardons and commutations During his first year in office  the Advisory Board of Appeals received 131 petitions for commutations and pardons  That was more than twice as many as the board received in 2006  during Romney’s last year in office  nIn the ensuing years  the Advisory Board gave the governor one recommendation for a commutation and none for pardons  He rejected the commutation In his interview Thursday with WGBH  Patrick said that he once considered granting pardons to an entire class of convicts serving time for nonviolent drug offenses but found it was too difficult to pinpoint them since they were tangled up in other  more serious legal issues By 2013  the number of petitions filed with the board fell to 48  People simply stopped expecting that Patrick would grant a pardon  said Representative Russell Holmes  a Mattapan Democrat “I haven’t even gotten a request from a constituent on behalf of a family member to be pardoned ” he said  “You go through almost three terms         and it’s not happening  You move on to other things ”If Patrick agrees to pardon the men  his recommendations will go to the Governor’s Council  which will vote on whether to approve them Jeffrey Snyder  a 43 year old cancer survivor living in Sheffield with his wife and teenage daughter  served two years in the Berkshire House of Correction after he was arrested for selling a small bag of marijuana when he was a 17 year old high school senior  The Advisory Board described the sentence as “very harsh ”After his release  Snyder was never arrested again  but his record has kept him from pursuing his dream job as a high school sports coach “I’d like to vote ” Snyder said during his hearing for a pardon  “I’ve never had the opportunity to vote ”Edem Seth Amet  a 39 year old Liberian man  was convicted of selling crack cocaine in 1995 to a confidential police informant  His record means he is ineligible to become a US citizen  and though he can work in the country legally  he harbors fears of deportation True See Allah  44  is the only person seeking a pardon for a violent offense  Allah  now a Suffolk County Sheriff’s Office employee who helps inmates make the transition from jail to freedom  was convicted in 1991 of armed assault with intent to murder for his role in the shooting of a man he thought was a gang rival  The victim was left paralyzed After Allah was released in 1998  he devoted himself to steering drug addicts and criminals on Boston streets to the Nation of Islam  His work was so effective  he quickly drew the respect of city leaders  police  and prosecutors  Suffolk District Attorney Daniel F  Conley  whose office prosecuted Allah before Conley’s tenure  even wrote a letter supporting his pardon It is unclear if any pardons are imminent  Patrick declined to comment beyond his statements on the radio  The board is also holding hearings for inmates seeking early release  but has not made any recommendations to Patrick Earlier this year  Patrick changed the guidelines for commutations and pardon petitions to make it easier for convicts to be eligible  Before  a petitioner’s record had to be clean for 15 years in felony cases and 10 years in misdemeanor cases to be eligible  That time was reduced to 10 years for felonies and five years for misdemeanors', '2014_86')",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

economy and shape the skyline and the very identity of the city he loved through an unprecedented five consecutive terms in City Hall  died Thursday  He was 71 and was diagnosed with advanced cancer not long after leaving office at the beginning of this year “Visionaries don’t get things done ” he once said  crisply separating himself from politicians who gaze at distant horizons and imagine what might be  Leaving to others the lofty rhetoric of Boston as the Athens of America  he took a decidedly ground level view of the city on a hill  earning himself a nickname for his intense focus on the nuts and bolts of everyday life  the urban mechanic  t nAn old school politician whose  smarts owed more to the streets than the college classroom  Mr  Menino nonetheless helped turn Boston into a hub of 21st century innovation  recruiting high tech companies to the sprawling South Boston waterfront one minute  then cutting the ribbon at a neighborhood burrito shop the next “No man possessed a greater love for our city  and his dedicated life in service to Boston and her people changed the face of the city ” said his successor  Mayor Martin J  Walsh “With sheer determination and unmatched work ethic ” Walsh said  Mr  Menino “put us on the world stage as a national leader in health care  education  innovation  and the nitty gritty of executing basic city services ”“Because of his leadership ” he added  “Boston is a better place today ”It was a few weeks into Mr  Menino’s summer tenure as acting mayor in 1993  when some pundits fancied him a temporary caretaker  that he offered a seemingly modest ambition  “I want to help people  help one individual a day  Just to make their life a little bit better ”His landslide election that fall to a first full term inaugurated a 20 year run as mayor  Deftly managing the city’s finances  Mr  Menino guided Boston’s commercial growth through roller coaster peaks and dips in the national economy  largely allowing the city to avoid the massive budget cuts that plagued other urban centers in the throes of the 2008 2009 downturn Throughout his years as mayor  development accelerated as the city added millions of square feet of new buildings  Wielding the power of his office  Mr  Menino could make development deals flourish — or shatter them just as swiftly  Known for his micromanaging  which at times drew criticism  he once intervened to personally approve the design of a Back Bay tower’s crown like peak In a statement Thursday  President Obama said Mr  Menino was “bold  big hearted  and Boston strong ”“Tom was the embodiment of the city he loved and led for more than two decades ” Obama said  “As Boston’s longest serving mayor  Tom helped make his hometown the vibrant  welcoming  world class place it is today  His legacy lives on in every neighborhood he helped revitalize  every school he helped turn around  and every community he helped make a safer  better place to live ”For constituents  Mr  Menino was the perennial mayor in their midst  a constant presence at local events  More than half of the Bostonians who responded to a 2008 Globe poll said they had met him personally  Anyone who watched the mayor stroll through neighborhoods from Bowdoin Geneva to West Roxbury might think that figure far too low  nMr  Menino’s health had declined in recent years  and he was hospitalized with a broken leg three days before the bombings at the 2013 Boston Marathon  Checking himself out against his doctor’s advice  he attended the first news conference and three days later pushed himself out of his wheelchair to stand at the pulpit and speak at an interfaith service  “We are one Boston ” he said that day  “No adversity  no challenge  nothing can tear down the resilience in the heart of this city and its people ”A politician with a flashing temper  whose skin could be as thin as his victory margins were thick  Mr  Menino was Boston’s first mayor of Italian descent  After that first landslide in 1993  his reelection margins never dropped below 15 percentage points and were as high as 49 points  His time in office also straddled a significant demographic shift  when the number of white residents in the city fell below 50 percent  and as Boston changed  he built a vaunted Democratic political machine   A protégé of Joseph Timilty  a former city councilor and state senator  Mr  Menino  landed his first government jobs with his mentor’s assistance  and knew firsthand how to use patronage Reaching beyond his solid base  Mr  Menino also courted disparate constituencies that other candidates ignored or paid too little heed  such as African Americans  gays and lesbians  and conservatives in East Boston “If  100 years from now  they look back at my election  I hope what they see is the beginning of a century of inclusive politics ” Mr  Menino said in January 1994 at Faneuil Hall as part of his first State of the City address  “Throughout my whole career I have tried to be an open door to people left out of the mainstream  As mayor  I intend to continue that ”Robert E  Travaglini  a former state Senate president who served with Mr  Menino on the City Council  said that “Tommy Menino always followed his instincts and did what his heart and his head told him to do  For years  people were overlooked and underserved  He focused on those portions of the population  and he championed their causes  and they responded ”Mr  Menino was stung as a boy by disparaging treatment from teachers dismissive of his Italian American heritage  and  nin his first mayoral campaign he stressed that he would “not tolerate racism  I will never tolerate people being discriminated against ” He opposed bias of any kind  and few gestures were as potent as his decision early on to march in the city’s gay pride parade  while shunning South Boston’s traditional St  Patrick’s Day parade because it banned groups advocating for lesbian and gay rights  Years later  when the state began permitting same sex marriages on May 17  2004  Mr  Menino was waiting at City Hall to greet Julie and Hillary Goodridge  who were first in line  As lead plaintiffs  they had lent their name to the state Supreme Judicial Court case that legalized gay marriage six months earlier “It is hard to imagine that LGBT people and people living with HIV could have had a more devoted and rock solid friend than Mayor Menino ” the organization Gay   Lesbian Advocates   Defenders  known as GLAD  said in a statement  “His policies and positions were all aimed at ensuring not only that LGBT people were welcome in Boston  but that they could participate fully and equally in the life of our city ”When President Bill Clinton appointed Mayor Raymond L  Flynn ambassador to the Vatican  Mr  Menino was the City Council president  “Go out and get some new suits  you’re going to be acting mayor ” he recalled Flynn telling him when the ambassador discussions were afoot  On July 19  1993  Mr  Menino was sitting in his council office when an aide appeared at 4 20 p m  to say Flynn had formally resigned  The council president automatically succeeds a mayor who departs in the middle of a term  That night  Mr  Menino and his wife  Angela  danced at a Hyde Park block party to “My Way ” a favorite tune that became a de facto theme song — played again as the Meninos walked into Faneuil Hall on March 28  2013  when he announced he would not seek a sixth term “For 20 years  Boston has been lucky to have Tom Menino in the mayor’s office ” the Globe’s editorial board wrote the next day  “The city has improved in almost every respect  Menino wasn’t personally responsible for every positive development — many cities enjoyed the benefits of lower crime rates and a return to urban living — but he guided the changes with impressive political skills and finesse ”Nearly two decades earlier  after Mr  Menino was elected Boston’s 53d mayor on Nov  2  1993  Clinton called with congratulations  “Thank you  Mr  President  for making the mayor ambassador ” Mr  Menino said  nPlain spoken sentiments were a trademark of Mr  Menino  who often was famously tongue tied and prone to malapropisms  His swallowed words may have inspired the painful “Mumbles” nickname he wished would fade  but voters didn’t seem to mind  perhaps sensing in his labored language the wisdom of a common man who had done uncommonly well “Like people who give great speeches are great public officials  I mean  just look at the officials who give great speeches — they haven’t done a thing in their career  but they just look good or sound good ” Mr  Menino told the Globe in July 1993  “I’d like to see what they’ve done in their careers  What’s their record  Who have they helped ”While serving as acting mayor  he noted that a neighborhood newspaper headline had called him “Action mayor Tom Menino ” and said that if elected he would try to live up to the typo  Before facing voters that fall  he froze water rates  worked to bolster the city’s community policing effort  earmarked $1 million for housing for the elderly  and set aside $500 000 to fund summer jobs for youth  that last item a policy initiative to which he returned year after year  “It was the beginning of something big ” he later recalled  nHe handily defeated state Representative James T  Brett in November  ending a run of Irish American mayors that stretched back decades  Mr  Menino received 64 4 percent of the vote to Brett’s 35 6 percent  one of Boston’s largest mayoral victories in the latter part of the 20th century  Though hard fought  the campaign was largely amicable  and after it was over  the candidates preserved a strong relationship As he easily was reelected four times  Mr  Menino kept up a punishing pace  rising early to crisscross the city  Kevin H  White  the four term mayor who preceded Flynn  pioneered little city halls in outer neighborhoods  At times  Mr  Menino seemed to embody them  White and Flynn both yearned for the national stature of higher offices  For Mr  Menino  being mayor was a calling of the highest order On that November 1993 morning after he was first elected  the difference from the day before was apparent  “When you’re acting mayor  some people return your phone calls ” Mr  Menino said  “When you’re mayor  everyone returns your phone calls ”And everyone around him quickly learned that no cog in the vast machinery of city government was too small to escape his attention  En route to the office each day he called subordinates to report on what needed fixing or sprucing up  a pothole here  a broken street light there  an abandoned car that needed towing  a neighborhood park in need of mowing  Except for his ever present finely tailored suits  Mr  Menino was more workhorse than showhorse  earning his “urban mechanic” nickname neighborhood by neighborhood  street by street “I didn’t learn anything sitting in this room ” Mr  Menino told the Globe in July 2013  in his fifth floor City Hall office  “I’d rather be out there  talking to the people  This job  my legacy  is about the people ”For two decades  until his final December in office  Mr  Menino spent Christmas Eve touring the streets of the Bowdoin Geneva neighborhood  initially on foot and later by SUV when his health declined  “I’ll never say goodbye ” he said last December as he met once more with people  pastors  and business owners in a neighborhood that has seen more than its share of violence  gangs  and drugs  “I’ll be back here next year  the year after  and the year after  Not as mayor  but as a person who cares about what’s going on in the neighborhood ”Cardinal Seán P  O’Malley said Thursday that it was “a blessing for me to have known Tom and Angela since the time I arrived in Boston and to share in their faith and their good works  They always held providing support and assistance for people in need as a priority ”Some criticized Mr  Menino’s unstinting devotion to minutiae  saying it diverted him from larger issues  In 1996  for example  he said voters should “judge me harshly” if he failed to improve the education system  Graduation rates remained comparatively flat through much of his tenure  only rising in recent years  and city schools also experienced persistent racial achievement gaps  Still  he appointed two longstanding Boston public schools superintendents  providing much needed stability for a system that was shaken by the busing crisis and an extended period of short term superintendents  Beginning in 1995  Thomas Payzant served nearly 11 years  Carol Johnson was in the job six years until retiring last year  nNo stranger to the academic challenges children face  Mr  Menino was a C student at St  Thomas Aquinas High School in Jamaica Plain and resisted his father’s insistence that he pursue higher education  “When I’d get after him to go to college  he’d say  ‘Truman never went to college ’ u2009” Mr  Menino’s father  Carl  who died in 1989  said in a 1983 WGBH TV documentary  adding  “He told me that a thousand times ”Only after being elected to the City Council in 1983 did Mr  Menino take to heart a mentor’s advice that he needed a college education if he wanted to advance  He graduated at 45  through a program that gave him a chunk of credits for serving as a city councilor  By that measure  when a bachelor’s degree at last arrived  he essentially had majored in being Tom Menino Though not averse to being addressed as “mayor ” he remained a man of his neighborhood  often leaving phone messages identifying himself simply as Tom or Tommy  In his memoir “Mayor for a New America ” written with Jack Beatty and released Oct  14  he wrote about his beginnings in Hyde Park  the southernmost section of Boston that most politicians considered “the sticks ”Born Dec  27  1942  he was the oldest of three children  Mr  Menino’s father was part of the machinists union and worked 35 years at a Westinghouse plant  where he helped the future mayor land a summer job during high school  “By then my dad was a foreman ” Mr  Menino wrote  “I noticed how he heard the men out  It was his way of showing respect  That was my first lesson in politics ”Mr  Menino’s mother  Susan  “was a Mother Teresa to new immigrants in Hyde Park ” he wrote  The Meninos lived on the first floor of a two family house on Hyde Park Avenue and his paternal grandparents  immigrants from a village in southern Italy  lived upstairs The family owned an apartment building next door  where new immigrants cycled through every few years until they saved enough for a place of their own  Fluent in Italian  Mr  Menino’s mother helped them with bills  schools  and job applications  “every stage of their journey to America ”“I was 21 when she died with my 6 year old brother  David  in her arms ” he wrote  adding that his father’s grief “was total  like his love ” He wrote that his mother “was the strongest influence on my life ” inspiring his compassion for Boston’s newcomers and those struggling to succeed Mr  Menino noted in his memoir that he faced his own struggles at school  where “because my teeth and lips would not cooperate  I talked out of the side of my mouth  mumbling decades before I was called ‘Mumbles ’ u2009”  nTeachers tended to ignore those not at the top of the class  That indifference stayed with him  and once he was mayor  Mr  Menino insisted on handing out awards to more than just the students who fared best on tests  though he conceded that his early parochial school education had at least one advantage  “I had 12 years of nuns who used to use their sticks on me ” he told the Globe in 1993  “If they did that today  you’d have more court cases  but it was good discipline ”In his memoir  Mr  Menino wrote that Harry Truman was his “political hero  I hung his portrait behind my desk at City Hall  A plain spoken man of the people ” Through David McCullough’s biography  a favorite book of the mayor’s  he learned that the former president “was also a scholar of Greek and Roman history  The public library was his college ”The public itself was Mr  Menino’s university as he climbed from his Hyde Park neighborhood to City Hall through a series of jobs  meeting little success until he found a home  and key mentors  in politics  He cleaned furnaces in a factory  took hot dog orders at Simco’s on the Bridge in Mattapan from 3 p m  until 2 a m   and then was hired as an insurance salesman for Metropolitan Life  a job for which  by his own account  he was supremely unsuited  except perhaps for the always presentable suits he wore Mr  Menino wrote that he took his sartorial cues from his father  who on Sundays “wore only the best  down to his silk shorts and cashmere socks ” The mayor was a regular at Filene’s Basement  shopping there three or four times a week until the store closed  He once estimated that he owned about 400 ties  75 to 80 shirts  numerous suits  and several blazers  “I need every piece ” he said with a smile Working for Metropolitan Life  meanwhile  meant he had a respectable job when he met Angela Faletra as they played tennis on adjoining courts in Hyde Park one day and her errant shots kept angling his way  Their first date was that night  “She was pretty  bright  funny  and compassionate ” he wrote  “A Roslindale girl  but you can’t have everything  I’ve often been asked if becoming acting mayor of Boston wasn’t the luckiest break of my life  No  I reply ”They married in 1966  a few years after that first meeting  Fiercely devoted to the man she called “my Tommy ” Angela Menino kept working throughout their marriage  long after their two children  Susan and Thomas Jr   were grown and she could have set aside her accounting job at John Hancock Financial Services  “Work gives me my own identity ” she told the Globe in 2004  “Angie is the real thing ” Mr  Menino added in the same interview  “She doesn’t have to work  She could have a driver  and somebody to clean the house  But she’ll never give it up ”As his emissary of sorts  she served on several boards while advocating for children and the elderly  women  and the homeless  and she helped keep Mr  Menino grounded in who he was and where he was from  “She watches out to make sure Tom Menino stays Tom Menino ” David A  Passafaro  the mayor’s former chief of staff  told the Globe in 2005 Not long before Angela met Mr  Menino  he found himself drawn to John F  Kennedy’s presidential campaign  “In 1960 you couldn’t live in Massachusetts and be Catholic and ignore politics ” he wrote in his memoir  Mr  Menino skipped a night school class to attend Kennedy’s election eve speech at Faneuil Hall  and he joined the adoring crowds chasing JFK’s limousine along cobblestone streets  “waving my arms like a madman while running for all I was worth ”“Tom Menino was an extraordinary leader and a wonderful friend ” said Victoria Reggie Kennedy  the widow of US Senator Edward M  Kennedy  “He and my husband Ted had a great relationship  built on mutual respect  trust  and love of the city of Boston ”In the early 1960s  Mr  Menino met Joseph Timilty  who wanted to be a city councilor  Mr  Menino worked to help elect Timilty  who repaid the favor when the future mayor lost his job at Metropolitan Life while trying to organize a union  “He got me ‘on’ at the Boston Redevelopment Authority ” Mr  Menino wrote Meanwhile  Mr  Menino remained a key part of the campaign apparatus as Timilty moved from the City Council to the state Senate  and then took on Kevin White in the mayoral contests of 1971  ’75  and ’79  “I was Joe’s ‘body man ’ u2009” Mr  Menino recalled  “I saw him the first thing in the morning and the last thing at night ”The political training proved invaluable as Mr  Menino found he had a gift for sweating the behind the scenes details of planning and executing campaign events  which he put to use while helping run Pennsylvania field operations for Jimmy Carter’s presidential campaigns in 1976 and ’80  “I was paid peanuts for my work ” he wrote of those early years  “I would have paid to do it ” As a Timilty operative  Mr  Menino also learned about the perils of patronage when “Kevin White fired me from the BRA ” Timilty intervened again  Using his influence as a state senator  he “got me a job on one of his committees ” Mr  Menino wrote Years later  when Mr  Menino was mayor  Timilty was convicted of conspiracy to commit fraud and sentenced to four months in federal prison  “The contrast in our fortunes was painful to me ” Mr  Menino wrote By becoming mayor  the protégé achieved what his mentor could never accomplish in the White era  Mr  Menino’s first step was the City Council  a goal that seemed implausible  “I was the shyest person in the neighborhood ” he told the Globe in 1993  just after becoming acting mayor  “I was very  very shy  When I decided to run for office people in the neighborhood couldn’t believe it ” He won that first election after the City Council expanded from all at large seats to a combination of at large and district seats  Announcing his candidacy while standing in the backyard of his childhood home on Hyde Park Avenue  he ran in the district covering Hyde Park and slices of other neighborhoods  Angela at his side  he campaigned “ u2009‘the Menino way ’ one door  one vote at a time ” and won handily On the City Council  he sought the chairmanship of the newly formed Ways and Means Committee and established a reputation as a workhorse  intimate with the details and reach of the powerful panel that controlled the city’s budget  Rarely did Mr  Menino consider stepping away from city politics  In 1986  he flirted with a run for Suffolk County sheriff  but decided against it  and in 1992  he announced a bid for the soon to be vacant 11th Congressional District seat  only to see it evaporate in redistricting During those years he also picked up a new  valuable mentor in Gerard Doherty  who had chaired the Democratic State Committee and was a longtime Kennedy campaign operative  It was Doherty who told Mr  Menino he needed a college degree if he wanted to be mayor  so he enrolled at the University of Massachusetts Boston at the same time his daughter  Susan  was at the Amherst campus Mr  Menino reached a key stepping stone to the mayor’s office when he wove together a coalition of moderate and conservative councilors to be elected City Council president at the beginning of 1993  defeating Maura Hennigan in a 7 6 vote on the first ballot  That set the stage for his ascension to acting mayor when Flynn left to be ambassador to the Vatican  “I had to be mayor to be elected mayor ” Mr  Menino wrote  “That was my strategy ”Once elected  he proceeded to shape the look and feel of Boston as perhaps no other mayor had in the past  His intimacy with the city ranged from obscure budget details to the placement of fire hydrants  so developers knew the success of high profile proposals for highly visible projects often hinged on pleasing Mr  Menino For example  when the late Edward Linde was chief executive of Boston Properties Inc   he wanted to construct a 36 story building next to the Prudential Tower  “Guys  flat roofs don’t make it ” Mr  Menino said as he looked at the architectural drawings  Linde and his architect tried again  bringing a set of miniature proposed roofs to City Hall and setting each one atop the model of their planned tower  Linde later recalled the mayor’s reaction to one that looked like a crown  “He said  ‘I think this one would be great ’ u2009” Today  111 Huntington Ave  is among the most recognizable buildings in the city’s skyline At different points  Mr  Menino found himself at odds with the city’s public sector unions  with contact negotiations sometimes becoming rancorous  deeply personal affairs  Noting that one Fire Department captain had published a letter to the editor in the Globe with the phrase “we die for you ” an exasperated Mr  Menino wrote in his memoir  “Give me a break  Try negotiating with a union whose members die for you ”Revitalizing South Boston’s seaport turned a faded industrial waterfront into a booming district with an art museum and high end restaurants  a sprawling venture that took most of his tenure to realize  Mr  Menino also helped guide significant projects to outlying areas  including a $500 million New Balance development in Brighton and a $115 million municipal services building in Roxbury’s Dudley Square Chief executives of major cities often want to leave behind a defining development  For Kevin White  it was Quincy Market  Mr  Menino envisioned a 1 000 foot skyscraper in the Financial District  which he said would be “a stunning statement of our belief in Boston’s bright future ” It was never built Other challenges also proved vexing  Race remained a measure for success  or lack thereof  in the city’s schools  And while graduation rates increased incrementally  that was enough to draw praise  “This is a school system that has improved substantially ” Samuel Tyler  president of the Boston Municipal Research Bureau  said in 2013  “That’s not to say we solved all the problems by any means  There’s still a lot to be done with the achievement gaps among racial groups ”Mr  Menino was more successful presiding over what became known as the Boston Miracle  In his early years as mayor  police stepped up outreach to neighborhood groups and church leaders to try to quell gang violence  Homicides plummeted from 98 in 1993  when Mr  Menino became acting mayor  to 31 in 1999  Violent crime rose again  but not to the levels of the late 1980s and early 1990s  and by the end of his tenure the number of homicides dropped four consecutive years  to 40 in 2013  Several years ago  he also joined with then Mayor Michael Bloomberg of New York to cochair Mayors Against Illegal Guns  a nonprofit coalition that pushed for more gun controls “Whether it was tackling illegal guns or reviving neighborhoods  Tom was never afraid to take on tough issues ” Bloomberg said Thursday  “Tom was at his best when his city needed him most  In the aftermath of the Marathon bombing last year  he was steady as always  showing the same determined leadership that made his career in public service one of Boston’s most important and most influential ”As years passed  Mr  Menino consolidated power  becoming a strong political boss not to be crossed during his second decade in office  Still  programs that spoke to core beliefs forged early in his leadership remained in place  Finding summer work for youth — the initiative that helped lift his first mayoral bid — became an annual preoccupation as he tripled the number of participating private employers to 300  “He was obsessed with summer jobs with kids  because he saw that as a positive for the kids ” said Kevin Phelan  a commercial real estate executive and an ally of the mayor  “He’d lean on anybody and everybody that he knew to hire a kid or two or five or 25 for the summer  Every time you go to a meeting or a public event from January to May  it’s  ‘Well we’re up to 7 000 summer jobs  Last year we did 10 000  How’re we going to get another 3 000 ’ ”Mr  Menino  who lived in Hyde Park all his life  for many years in the Readville section  leaves his wife  Angela  his daughter  Susan Menino Fenton of Dorchester  his son  Thomas Jr  of Hyde Park  his brother  David of Hyde Park  his sister  Carolyn Phipps of Quincy  and six grandchildren  Beginning at 10 a m  Sunday  the mayor will lie in state at Faneuil Hall  On Monday a private funeral Mass will be said at noon in Most Precious Blood Church in Hyde Park  where Mr  Menino was baptized  More details about the service and the procession from Faneuil Hall to the church will be announced “Tom Menino and I shared more than the title of being Mayor of Boston ” said his predecessor  Raymond Flynn  “Yes  we sometime disagreed about issues  but we never had a difference of opinion about our respect for each other and our pride in making Boston a great city ”Flynn added that “the day I left City Hall to become US ambassador to the Vatican  I said  ‘The City is in good hands ’ Today  Tom Menino is in good hands ”Last year  Harvard University awarded Mr  Menino an honorary doctorate   n“I’m going to start wearing a bow tie pretty soon ” he joked to The New York Times “He was a strong and true friend of education  and he knew how much the pursuit of education and research means not only to Boston but to the larger world ” said Drew Faust  Harvard’s president  “All of us can learn from his powerful and humane example ”In his memoir  Mr  Menino settled a few scores  and he also listed many of his best known verbal gaffes  as if to defuse for the ages the running side narrative of his three decades in public office  reminding readers that he began his first mayoral speech in 1994 with the declaration  “I’m not a fancy talker ”More important to Mr  Menino were lists like the one detailing how he dealt with gender inequity at City Hall  Along with appointing the first women as mayor’s chief of staff and campaign manager  “I appointed Boston’s first woman police commissioner  first woman corporation counsel  first woman director of the Boston Redevelopment Authority ” he wrote  City government gave its employees four hours off annually for cancer screening  and “when my public health commissioner told me how many African American women suffered from breast cancer  we fitted out a van to conduct mammograms and parked it in front of beauty parlors in minority neighborhoods  Thousands of women gained years of life from preventative care ”His own health suffered sporadically through the years  “I’d had a bout with a rare cancer ” he wrote in his memoir  adding a list of other maladies that included Crohn’s disease  high blood pressure  an infected elbow  a torn tendon in his right knee  and a blood clot  Not even a broken leg could keep him in his wheelchair  however  when it was time to pay tribute at the interfaith service to those killed and injured in the Boston Marathon bombings “If you watched the service  you saw the struggle I had ” he wrote about the effort it took to stand at the pulpit  His blunt description of his frailty was characteristically unsparing  Mr  Menino recalled tucking his elbows back as his son tipped the wheelchair forward  “Biting my lower lip against a twinge of pain  grabbing the lectern for balance  I stood up  The enclosed pulpit hid the line connecting my catheter to the bag on my wheelchair ”Once on his feet  in clear pain and in an international spotlight as he delivered the most closely watched speech of his career  Mr  Menino exhibited the resilience he praised in the city he loved “This is Boston ” the mayor said  “a city with the courage  compassion  and strength that knows no bounds ” n n', '2014_865')",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

guy from Hyde Park ” he told a crush of reporters  nBut Thomas M  Menino is much more than that  to the more than 100 parents and children waiting for him at a Dorchester book signing Sunday afternoon and to residents across the city he helmed for more than 20 years  In the hours after his public disclosure that   the former mayor has received an outpouring of support and prayers From Grove Hall to South Boston  residents and officials alike wished Menino a speedy recovery  and said they were certain the man who will always be known as “mayor” would not back down from a tough fight  nMenino’s successor  Martin J  Walsh  said the people of Boston needed to pray for him “But I’m not going to sit here and give an obituary ” the current mayor said following a keynote speech he gave to the New England Food Show early Sunday afternoon  “Tom Menino still has a lot to give to this city ” During his appearance Sunday at a farmers market in Dorchester’s Codman Square  Menino struck an upbeat and defiant tone  calling himself a fighter who would conquer cancer just as he had previous health problems “I look forward to a healthy life” after treatment  he said  “I’m very confident on this  I’ll be back          I believe in myself  I believe in my doctors  and I believe in my faith  and I believe I have the ability to beat it back ”Menino’s appearance at the market had been scheduled before news of his illness broke  and was intended to help promote a children’s book by Dorchester author Kathleen Chardavoyne about his mayoralty Asked about the outpouring of support from Boston and beyond  Menino said he did not deserve it “Who am I  I’m just a guy from Hyde Park ” he saidTurning more serious  Menino added  “We’re a family city  We all know each other          When something happens to somebody else  they all rally  Look at what happened with the Marathon bombing and how we rallied then ”Menino appeared in good spirits  even joking about the book  “Goodbye  Mayor Menino ”“What an appropriate title that is ” he cracked Bostonians in attendance  many visibly worried  approached Menino to offer brief  quiet words of support  Some described family members who had overcome similar diagnoses  He then sat with a group of young children to listen to a reading of the book  giving them high fives and leaning in to listen intently as a little girl whispered in his ear Menino’s affinity for connecting with children was well known when he was mayor  Sunday afternoon  he said the only aspect of his diagnosis that concerned him was how his six grandchildren would take the news “They misinterpret sometimes the news ” he said  “You have to talk to them about it ”Asked if he felt sorry for himself because of a series of recent health problems  Menino said emphatically that he did not “I’m the luckiest guy in America ” he said  “I was lucky to lead this city for 20 years  The health things are a little bump in the road  but we get over them ”Earlier Sunday  at the St  John Chrysostom church in West Roxbury where Menino regularly attends Mass  emotional parishioners expressed grief over the cancer diagnosis and reflected on his importance to Boston “He made a great impact on Boston  especially with the spirit he had ” said 72 year old Hyde Park resident Mary Turley  “He loves this city  No matter what I disagreed with  I knew his heart was in the right place ”Parishioners also said Menino is a quiet member of the congregation who never seeks the spotlight  but is always ready to listen to the concerns of others “He isn’t one to make a big show of things ” said DeLane Anderson Jr  “I consider him to be such a good man  He does things in his own  humble way ”At the Roxbury Presbyterian Church Sunday  not everyone had heard the news before the service began  Concerned murmurs rippled through the congregation when the Rev  Liz Walker said during prayers  “Mayor Menino is fighting for his life ”Walker and other leaders of Boston’s religious community in attendance lauded the former mayor for his frequent attendance at their events and steady support of youth programs “He has always been and will always be a man of the people ” Walker said  “That’s why he stole my heart  Because you see so many political figures every once in a while  but Mayor Menino was everywhere — it was not a once in a while thing ”Walker said she most recently saw Menino when he attended a ceremony earlier this month installing her as pastor of the church  where he got an enthusiastic reception “I just want him to know that we are here for him  because he was always here for us ” she said In Grove Hall  an area on the Roxbury Dorchester border that Menino helped develop in the 1990s  residents reflected on the mark he left on the neighborhood Behind the counter of Grove Hall Convenience on Blue Hill Avenue  longtime employee Lucy Arroyo  63  said she remembers well what the area looked like before the Grove Hall Mecca shopping center opened across the street “He wanted to fix Grove Hall  to make it look better  because at that time  the area was ugly around here ” she said  “Now it’s a different place ”Menino was a strong advocate for the center  which opened in 1999  and the 5 000 affordable housing units that came with it Nearby  at Edward’s Barber Shop  Hyde Park resident Brenda Maria Mena  27  said she remembered meeting Menino as a 9 year old art contest winner at the Haley Elementary School in Roslindale For Mena and other residents her age  Menino’s long tenure as mayor spanned the majority of their lives  To them  he is an immutable fixture of life in Boston  Mena said she was speechless when she learned Menino has advanced cancer “He’s such a prominent figure for Boston ” Mena said  “I hope he recovers  and that his family stays strong  and that he stays strong ”At Boston’s annual St  Patrick’s Day breakfast  state Senator Linda Dorcena Forry  the event’s host  addressed the news of the former mayor’s illness early in the humor heavy event  She said this year’s iteration of the South Boston tradition would be dedicated to him and his recovery “Many of us woke up today and our hearts were heavy upon learning of the mayor’s illness  But you know what  that’s not what Tom Menino wants  He doesn’t want to turn on the TV and see our long faces ” she said She added the best way to help him take on his next challenge was to make him laugh For his part  Menino said at the Dorchester book signing he was glad to have missed the political event  which he compared to “a root canal without Novocain ”While the speakers at the breakfast — a roast  variety show   and concert in one — focused their remarks on jokes  some made reference to Menino’s diagnosis City Councilor Michael F  Flaherty  whom Menino handily beat in the 2009 Boston mayoral race  advised the former mayor to look at his cancer fight like it was a political contest “Treat this ailment         like an election ” he said  “If you do that  Mayor Menino  you’re going to survive and you’re going to do very well and you’re going to conquer this thing ”Walsh said he spoke with Menino on Saturday night and said his predecessor told him  “I’ve beaten this before ” The crowd applauded loudly After the breakfast  politicos lauded Menino’s strength City Councilor Tito Jackson said he knows Menino is a strong willed fighter “I know that he is too strong and too stubborn to be overcome by this ” Jackson said  “He has fought many battles  And he’s won most of them ”Treasurer Steven Grossman said Menino “is showing what Boston Strong is all about ”And state Senator Stanley C  Rosenberg said that the breakfast was infused with Boston’s affection for the city’s longtime chief “He’s loved by these people  he’s loved by the city of Boston

city’s residency requirement  a law frequently ignored and weakly enforced  according to a Globe analysis of payroll and property records Among them  the Police Department’s second in command  Superintendent in Chief William G  Gross  who lives in Milton  according to payroll records  t nBut he’s hardly alone  Managers in the city’s technology division and the Inspectional Services Department  high ranking school administrators  and the head of the school police  Eric J  Weston  also live beyond Boston’s border  So does Matthew A  Cahill  executive director of the Finance Commission  a city watchdog agency  nThe Globe identified at least 50 municipal employees living in the suburbs in apparent violation of the residency requirement  But there may be hundreds more violating the spirit of the law  if not the letter  Many School Department employees — nurses  psychologists  guidance counselors  and others — have been allowed to ignore the residency requirement and live in the suburbs In the four decades since the residency rule was introduced — it arrived at a time when the city was hemorrhaging middle class families — a simple idea has been overtaken by a contradictory patchwork of ordinances  state laws  and labor contracts  At times  tradition  as much as statute  has dictated application of the policy  allowing some employees to live in the suburbs because of the vagueness of the rules  nThe city’s newly elected mayor  Martin J  Walsh  saw firsthand the perils of trying to amend the residency rule when his plan to exempt select top officials from the requirement provoked a fierce backlash  Walsh said the Globe’s findings brought serious “concerns to light ” and he pledged that his administration would investigate individual cases and work to fix the residency policy  although he has not yet figured out how  he said The mayor said he was not prepared to terminate the employment of longtime municipal workers living outside the city  especially members of the police command staff  even though the law calls for firing employees who flout the residency requirement  t n“I’m not going to fire people in the city of Boston  but I am going to correct the situation as best we can ” Walsh said in an interview  “We have our legal department looking at it right now  and then we are going to have to take a deeper dive  How do we enforce the law  How is the law distributed  meaning who is exempt and who is not exempt ”The employees identified by the Globe were not exactly hiding where they lived  The city payroll office listed the employees’ home addresses in the suburbs  The Globe review — which involved analyzing employees’ home ZIP codes  date of hire  and union status — determined that the residency law has been arbitrarily applied and unevenly enforced “There seem to be so many exclusions and rules  There is no real pattern to residency that we can actually come up with ” Walsh said  “My responsibility as mayor of the city is to get  the residency law  under control and come up with a policy that people will understand and follow ” The ordinance has become so porous that only 43 percent of Boston’s nearly 18 000 employees are now required to live in the city  Still  even if they’re not required to live in the city  most do  According to the payroll  roughly two thirds of municipal workers call Boston home  Higher paid city employees are more likely to live in the suburbs  the Globe review found The inconsistency of the residency policy is perhaps most stark in schools  Joe Fidler is a night shift custodian who earns roughly $17 an hour cleaning the former Hyde Park High School  a building now occupied by two schools  With eight years on the job  Fidler is required to live in Boston  and he just moved with his wife and two children to Hyde Park from a three bedroom apartment in Roslindale because they could no longer afford the rent In the building Fidler cleans  10 teachers and other classroom instructors who have not worked for the city as long as he has live in the suburbs  according to payroll records  Almost all of the instructors are paid more than Fidler  according to payroll records  but they commute from Malden  Quincy  and other towns where property can be less expensive than Boston “Why should they be able to live outside the city and I can’t ” asked Fidler  who rents because he said he cannot afford to purchase a home in Boston  “We’re in the same school  What’s fair for one isn’t fair for the other ” nTeachers and other classroom instructors are exempt under state law from the residency requirement  but the statute does not specifically address other School Department employees represented by the Boston Teachers Union The School Department has not forced the issue  resulting in an inequitable system that disproportionately affects lower paid workers  Most other unionized city employees — including custodians who mop school hallways — must live in Boston for a decade before having the option of moving out of the city “A lot of teachers do live in the city  but I’d love to see more ” Walsh said  adding  “If I was a custodian that would probably bother me a little bit ”The residency requirement still has its staunch defenders  including Walsh  who said he favors residency in “99 9 percent of cases ” Another is Eileen Boyle  a longtime crusader for the residency policy who led a push to toughen the requirement in the 1990s  She credits the law for creating stable neighborhoods filled with municipal workers But Boyle expressed frustration that city officials have ignored violators for years “There’s a culture of don’t say anything and the department heads don’t do anything ” said Boyle  who serves on the Boston Residency Compliance Commission  a body created to enforce the law  “If your leadership doesn’t care  it’s not going to trickle down  I just feel so bad for the people who are following the rules ” nSome analysts argue that the residency law has outlived its usefulness in a city with a surging population and rising housing costs  Northeastern University economist Barry Bluestone said the policy would make sense only if the city was providing housing that allowed people to live in Boston at an affordable price “It seems to me a mistake to limit yourself to only those who can afford to live here or chose to live here ” Bluestone said  “It’s a little parochial to think we have to maintain our own population here and if you are not a Bostonian  you can’t work for the city  I think we should be thinking regionally ”Edward L  Glaeser  a Harvard professor who studies the economics of cities  said a resurgent Boston does not need a law to retain residents or boost demand for local real estate “The question for the policy ” Glaeser said  “is whether it delivers better government ”  nBig cities across the nation adopted residency policies in the 1970s hoping to combat urban flight  Boston was not immune from that phenomenon  as the city’s population shrank 20 percent over two decades  But Boston’s residency requirement has been  from the start  a convoluted remedy For example  top city officials and mayoral appointees have historically been given six months to move to the city  a courtesy Walsh recently extended to a year  But the legal foundation for the grace period is questionable  according to John McGonagle  who has served as chairman of the residency compliance commission since its inception “That’s kind of a mayoral amendment  It’s kind of evolved over the years ” McGonagle said  adding in an e mail  “My understanding of the residency ordinance  that  has been explained to us by corporate  counsel   is that this ordinance provides for no exemptions  delays  or ‘phase in’ periods for any employee ”The first residency law was passed in 1973 and required “each officer appointed by the mayor or elected by the City Council” to become a Boston resident within six months  Officers were defined as the police and commissioners  city auditor  and other department heads Three years later  the city adopted a sweeping ordinance requiring that all employees “shall be a resident of the City of Boston ”The two laws were “inconsistent” because of the six month provision  McGonagle said  and it appears that “each ordinance is operating independently of each other ”Initially  both laws were largely ignored and the requirement was diluted  The state enacted laws championed by unions that nullified the residency requirement for all teachers  paraprofessionals  principals  and other classroom instructions and their supervisors  In the early 1990s  Mayor Thomas M  Menino strengthened the city law  creating the Boston Residency Compliance Commission  He appointed McGonagle  his Hyde Park neighbor  as chairman  a post he has held as an unpaid volunteer for two decades  The get tough on residency push grabbed headlines  In one instance  a blind man with cerebral palsy who had worked for the city for 10 years was forced to resign After nearly a decade  the Menino administration softened  The residency requirement became a bargaining chip to help settle labor contracts  Now  all of the city’s unions except one have secured the right for employees to move out of Boston after 10 years on the job The commission has one paid investigator  and in the last 20 years  150 employees have been forced off the city payroll for living in the suburbs  That includes 69 employees caught living outside of Boston  81 others resigned before they could be fired  The commission is reactive by design and only responds to complaints  McGonagle said  It does not proactively hunt for violators  nThe senior members of many city departments live outside Boston  Take the Boston Fire Department  Of the 65 highest ranking members  only 14 live in Boston  With the exception of the fire commissioner  all top members of the department are members of the union  The union contract allows them to move to the suburbs after 10 years on the job Then there’s the police command staff  All 22 of the top ranking officers worked their way up through the union  meaning they could move out of the city after 10 years  But because they moved into management  they are out of the union  and therefore no long covered by the 10 year exemption in union contracts McGonagle described the police command staff as a “gray area” unique to the police department  Boyle  another member of the residency compliance commission  said she thought any nonunion employee “should be living in the city ” Vivian Leonard  Boston’s human resources director  agreed that nonunion employees must live in the city “You need to move back in ” Leonard said  “If you’re in the union and you get promoted to a nonunion position  you have to  Absolutely ”Walsh said having members of the command staff live outside Boston was “a concern of mine ”“If they are actually not in compliance with the residency requirement  I am not going to change my command staff ” Walsh said  “But I am going to fix the problem ” The School Department was “seeking clarity” on how the residency requirement pertains to Weston  the schools police chief who lives in Canton  and others  according to a department spokesman  Interim school Superintendent John McDonough said in a prepared statement that the residency policy is “the result of many years of complex regulations that have changed over time ”McDonough has lived in Boston his entire life  he said  and “as city employees  we are in a better position to serve our community when we ourselves are a part of that community ”The Finance Commission’s Cahill said his agency is unique because he reports to a state appointed board  although he is paid by the city  The residency requirement has never “been addressed either way for us ” said Cahill  who lives in North Grafton  Cahill said that when he did live in Boston  he felt harassed by police and other city workers he was paid to scrutinize as a watchdog “I tried it and it didn’t work well ” Cahill he said  “It doesn’t benefit us to live in the city ”Gross  the police superintendent in chief  declined an interview request through a department spokesman  Police Commissioner William B  Evans  a lifelong South Boston resident  said he selected his command staff based on experience and to add diversity to the upper ranks of the department “To be quite frank  I’ve been on this job for 33 years  The command staff for as far back as I can remember lived outside in the city ” Evans said  “I always thought there was no requirement for the command staff ” n•  n•  n•  n•  n', '2014_540')",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
330,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"('The first time Brian Simpkins was arrested on a charge of drunken driving — after ramming his Chevy pickup into a tree in Canton — he was just 19 The second time he was arrested — after he was found passed out in his car with the engine running in September 2012  a half empty can of Coors Light lying on the floor — he was a state trooper  charged with keeping the roads safe from drunk drivers   t nSimpkins  41  admitted that he started drinking beer after a softball tournament  went to a bar and drank some more  then went to another tavern and kept drinking before heading to the Wendy’s in Stoughton  where he was found asleep at the wheel  nHe was so groggy that when a state trooper asked him for his driver’s license  he handed over his Visa card instead But the Massachusetts State Police kept Simpkins  who earns roughly $130 000 a year  on paid administrative duty even after he lost his license for a year for refusing a breath test and couldn’t go out on patrol  And with no alcohol test results  a judge acquitted him of the criminal charges after tossing much of the other evidence on legal technicalities  Now  he’s back on patrol out of the Boston barracks  nSimpkins is one of at least 30 Massachusetts law enforcement officials who have been charged with drunken driving while off duty since the start of 2012  a Globe review has found  The crashes collectively killed three people and injured more than a half dozen others  Though some officers resigned or were placed on unpaid leave after the charges  a majority kept their jobs  sometimes after a short suspension  nThe drunken driving tally is almost certainly low because not every arrest is widely reported and officers sometimes let their peers off the hook  a practice known as “professional courtesy ” Massachusetts police departments have launched internal reviews at least four times in the last three years after learning that an officer or former officer was accused of drunken driving but was not arrested The Globe also found the vast majority of officers  like Simpkins  refused to take a breath test  making it harder to prosecute them criminally for drunken driving  And departments frequently went out of their way to accommodate them — keeping officers on the payroll even after they temporarily lost their licenses for refusing the test and could no longer do their regular duties  nIn addition  many departments tried to keep details of the drunken driving incidents involving their officers hidden when contacted by the Globe  Several departments  including Boston’s  refused to reveal the names of officers arrested for drunken driving  Others withheld police reports  photos of officers who were arrested  or other documents that are normally public after arrests The Globe’s findings saddened Ron Bersani of Marshfield  whose 13 year old granddaughter was killed by a drunk driver in 2003  inspiring “Melanie’s Law” to combat drunken driving    n“I think people in public service should be held to a higher standard  but that is apparently not the case ” said Bersani  grandfather of Melanie Powell  “It is enormously frustrating ” nPolice and advocacy groups alike agree that drunken driving is a national scourge  killing  10 000 people a year nationwide  And officers — just like anyone else — sometimes drink too much or misjudge their ability to drive  chiefs say  “Officers working the streets are human ” said Oak Bluffs police Chief Erik Blake  who was also president of the Massachusetts Chiefs of Police Association until last week  n nBut many expect more from police officers because they carry guns and are charged with enforcing the laws  including those barring drunk drivers from the roads  In addition  few know better than police the horrific toll of drunken driving accidents  as they are usually among the first to respond to crashes and see the injuries and deaths firsthand “If there is any group of people who would understand the impact of a drunken driving crash  it would be police officers ” said David DeIuliis  program director for Mothers Against Drunk Driving in Massachusetts  nThere’s on whether officers drink more than the rest of the population  but everyone acknowledges that some officers drink too much  Many of the largest police departments  including Boston’s and the Massachusetts State Police  have “stress units” to help officers struggling with alcoholism and other personal problems  n“It’s something in the culture ” said Sean Riley  president of   a Washington based national hot line to help first responders  which often gets reports of officers who have been accused of driving drunk  “We play hard  we drink hard ”There’s no complete database of drunken driving cases involving police officers  but a search of news articles by Bowling Green State University researchers  782 cases where officers were arrested from 2005 to 2010 for drunken driving nationwide  Still  that tally is probably only a fraction of the actual total because researchers did not spot every article and not every arrest is announced or picked up by the media   nSeveral departments contacted by the Globe said they do not have a specific policy on how to deal with officers accused of operating under the influence and instead make case by case judgment calls based on the circumstances and the officer’s past performance  n“Every single one of these cases has to be looked at on an individual basis ” said Colonel Timothy P  Alben  who oversees the Massachusetts state police  “I don’t think there is a blanket response the department can have to any one of them ”Some officers  including the   resigned after being arrested on charges of driving drunk  Others returned to duty after serving suspensions of between five and 60 days  In some cases  police wouldn’t say what  if any  action they took   nBut it appears agencies generally took stronger action in the most serious cases  involving deaths or repeat arrests  Even then  however  departments sometimes wait for the criminal cases to be resolved  a process that can sometimes take more than a year  nFor instance  state police have yet to decide on disciplinary action for a trooper involved in a fatal accident on the South Shore last fall  nIn that incident  John Basler was coming home coming from a party when he collided in Plymouth with the car of a mother and daughter returning from a Red Sox game  Both Susan Macchi  64  and her daughter Juliet Macchi  23  were killed in the crash  Plymouth police  did not disclose that a state trooper was involved and said they did not think alcohol was a factor   But hospital records later showed Basler  who had been at a party earlier that evening  had a blood alcohol level of 0 19  more than double the legal limit of 0 08  He now faces a  of charges  including two counts of motor vehicle homicide while operating under the influence The state police suspended Basler without pay after the charges were filed  But Basler  who pleaded not guilty  blamed the other driver  saying in a sworn statement that the collision “would not have taken place absent the fact that Ms  Susan Macchi’s Dodge Neon wandered over into my lane ” In other cases  officers have been fired or forced to resign after a second drunken driving arrest  nLowell police put Officer Eric Wayne on paid leave after he was arrested for drunken driving in July 2013 and refused to take a breath test  prompting his license to be automatically suspended for 180 days   nPolice eventually reinstated Wayne last June after he regained his license and the criminal case dragged on with no resolution  nBut two months later  Wayne allegedly drove drunk again —veering over the center line in Methuen  slamming into a Mercury Mountaineer  and killing the other driver  Briant Paula  26  of Lawrence  Paula’s sister also was injured in the crash  nMethuen police said Wayne lied about his last name  refused to give his address or driver’s license  and balked at taking sobriety tests or a breath test   nWayne resigned in September  just before he was indicted for manslaughter and motor vehicle homicide while under the influence of alcohol  The state also revoked his license  Had he not resigned  Lowell police said they probably would have put Wayne on unpaid leave  rather than firing him  pending the outcome of the charges   n“Without convictions in criminal cases  it’s difficult to remove an officer from the rolls ” Lowell Captain Timothy Crowley said Yet most drunken driving charges don’t result in a conviction  Prosecutors usually agree to dismiss charges for first offenders who agree to participate in alcohol education classes and other terms of probation  And some cases can be hard to prove  particularly when defendants refuse to take a breath test  Massachusetts is one of the few states where a refusal can’t be held against defendants in court  Of 22 officers who were asked to take a blood alcohol test  18 refused  Some of the officers who refused the test  such as Simpkins  were subsequently acquitted or had their charges reduced    nTo discourage people from refusing the breath test  Massachusetts enacted harsher penalties for a refusal under Melanie’s Law in 2005  Drivers normally face an automatic license suspension of 180 days — or longer for a subsequent offense That would ordinarily make it difficult for police to keep working — and potentially discourage them from refusing the test — because most officers need to drive for their job  nBut the Globe found at least 10 cases where police departments kept officers on the payroll when they lost their driving licenses for refusing the test  giving them paid leave or duties around the station instead  That includes three state troopers who were placed on restricted duty  including Simpkins  while their licenses were suspended  State police said the troopers were later disciplined for violating the department’s code of conduct but declined to reveal details of the punishment  which could have included a reprimand or brief suspension  nAlben  who oversees the state police  said he didn’t think it would be fair to fire officers or put them on unpaid leave when they lost their driver’s license for refusing to take a breath test  He said police have a right to refuse the test just like any other driver   n“You can’t expect that John Q  Private Citizen is going to give up his or her constitutional rights just because they happen to be a police officer ” Alben said  He also noted that law enforcement agencies  unlike many employers  generally hold workers accountable for arrests outside of work  n nSome officers are never arrested or even asked to take a breath test when they are accused of drinking and driving  nSeveral witnesses reported that Andover police officer Evan Robitaille seemed drunk after he allegedly crashed into a car on I 495 in Lowell last year and fled to a nearby gas station in his hobbled SUV One woman said Robitaille had trouble standing  A police officer said he sounded incoherent and “definitely intoxicated ”But instead of giving him sobriety tests  Lowell police dropped Robitaille off at a McDonald’s and arranged for an off duty Andover officer to give Robitaille a ride home  according to court documents  “It’s the ultimate professional courtesy ” said Bowling Green State University criminologist Phil Stinson  who conducted the national study of police arrests and suspects such incidents are frequent Indeed  it might be so common for police to receive special treatment that the Massachusetts Civil Service Commission questioned whether it was fair to punish a Pittsfield officer in a 2008 case for failing to report a traffic stop involving a fellow officer  “Every police officer who testified before the Commission testified that the routine and customary practice when a stop is made on a fellow police officer  is to show professional courtesy and not call in the stop ” read the commission  nRobitaille eventually resigned after an investigation led to his indictment for drunken driving  leaving the scene of an accident  and other violations  As part of a plea deal  prosecutors ultimately agreed to drop the drunken driving charge  — possibly because police never asked Robitaille to take sobriety tests at the scene  But Robitaille was placed on probation and ordered to put a device on his car to prevent him from drinking and driving in the future  A Lowell police officer also was reprimanded for giving Robitaille a ride  Similarly  a state trooper let Orleans police officer Travis Tebbetts off the hook in 2011 after 911 reports had him speeding and driving erratically in Dennis  Tebbetts admitted to downing eight beers  according to an   But instead of arresting him  the state trooper asked Orleans police to give him a ride home  A Yarmouth officer later told Orleans police it was “the most dangerous display of reckless driving” he had seen in his 16 years with the department and said he had heard reports that Tebbetts was a frequent drunk driver  After an internal investigation  Tebbetts was suspended for five days  but not fired  He has since left the department and was arrested for drunken driving in Brewster in August  nBut even when police try to punish officers for driving drunk or covering up such actions  officers sometimes fight back  In fact  one former state trooper is suing police for failing to make reasonable accommodations for his drinking problems  nState Police originally accused Adam Paicos of driving the wrong way down Memorial Drive in Cambridge in April 2012 — just weeks after he graduated from the police academy — but didn’t arrest him  After an internal investigation  the State Police fired Paicos for that and another incident related to alcohol But Paicos sued the department in August  arguing the alcohol problems resulted from a protected handicap — post traumatic stress disorder Paicos  a military veteran who said he began relying on alcohol after he returned from Iraq in 2009  contends he should have been given a year off to seek treatment for the stress disorder instead of being fired   “Such accommodation would not have presented a hardship ” the   Alben declined to comment on the suit Paicos is also fighting to land a police job elsewhere  Paicos successfully appealed to the Civil Service Commission after the Town of Maynard passed him over because of his problems with the state police  The commission  Maynard to place Paicos at the top of its list of future hires  but Chief Mark W  Dubois said he still won’t hire Paicos  nPaicos’s attorney  Daniel J  Moynihan  said Paicos could ultimately sue Maynard or other towns for refusing to hire him for alcohol problems resulting from PTSD   “I believe he’s being discriminated against ” said Moynihan  noting that Paicos has received treatment and not had any alcohol related incidents in two years In most of the drunken driving cases that the Globe reviewed  police put up roadblocks to getting information — refusing to release some information that is typically public  taking months to respond  or charging unusually high fees for documents The Massachusetts State Police have yet to respond to a request two months ago for reports on eight officers suspected of drunken driving except to say they will probably demand more than $1 000 for the records Boston police withheld the names of five officers who have been arrested since 2012 for drunken driving  saying the information was “protected ” even though it has identified on its  dozens of civilians arrested for drunken driving  One of the cases only became public after the victim expressed concern that the police department was trying to cover up the incident In that case  Richard Jeanetti nearly killed a young waitress after speeding through a stop sign and hitting two cars in Hyde Park in May 2012  Medical tests later found Jeanetti had a blood alcohol rate of 0 27  triple the legal limit  And his car’s “black box” indicated he was driving 68 miles an hour  more than double the speed limit for the area But police initially gave no indication in the  that Jeanetti was intoxicated  And Jeanetti wasn’t arrested  given a blood alcohol test  or even given a ticket for speeding or running the stop sign “It’s ridiculous how they handled it ” said Briana O’Neill  who was thrown from her car in the crash and sent to the hospital  “I felt they were trying to shove it under the rug ”  nBoston police Lieutenant Michael McCarthy said Jeanetti wasn’t arrested or given a breath test because he was taken to the hospital with injuries of his own that day  But McCarthy said the police immediately commenced a thorough investigation that led to the charges  Records show Jeanetti’s driver’s license was suspended 12 days after the crash  Last year  Jeanetti pleaded guilty to operating under the influence and agreed to resign as part of a plea bargain  Boston police wouldn’t say how Jeanetti would have been punished had he not resigned  But three other officers who were accused of drunken driving since Jeanetti’s crash  including one involving an accident  agreed to be suspended for 30 working days  though in two of those cases  officers only served 10 days of their suspensions with the rest set aside   nMeanwhile  O’Neill was injured so severely that she had to wear a neck brace for eight months and walk with crutches Even today  O’Neill said she still suffers pain and doesn’t have full range of motion in her neck  And she bears another permanent reminder  she got a tattoo with the date of the crash and the Japanese word for strength Said O’Neill  now 24  “An injury like that doesn’t go away ”  n', '2014_1053')",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
331,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"('Mayor Martin J  Walsh Wednesday defended the layoffs of eight longtime city workers  dismissing criticism that veteran employees were abruptly terminated  including two recognized in recent years for outstanding service Ellen Lipsey was honored with a 2012 Shattuck Award because she “worked tirelessly for historic preservation” as executive director of Boston’s Landmarks Commission  After 27 years  Lipsey had told friends she planned to retire in a few months  t nAs the Parks Department’s director of operations  Bernard P  Lynch received the same honor in 2013  The award  which celebrates exemplary service among city employees  cited Lynch’s “reputation as a firm but understanding leader” and described him as the “consummate employee” during 20 years with the city In an interview Wednesday  Walsh noted that the terminations affected eight people out of a municipal workforce of more than 18 000 “It’s public service  It’s tough  Unfortunately  sometimes your service comes to an end ” Walsh said  “I don’t want to sound insensitive  but you have to make changes ”Samuel R  Tyler  president of the Boston Municipal Research Bureau  said Walsh’s administration should have been more respectful of longtime employees  The research bureau is a fiscal watchdog agency funded by business and nonprofits  The bureau has honored municipal employees with Shattuck Awards for decades  In public service  Tyler said  the “corporate model of you’re dismissed and out the next day doesn’t work as well ”“This is a mayor who is thought of as a man of compassion ” Tyler said  “The stark firings are counter to that image  Particularly if you have people who are committed and they have done a good job ” nLipsey and Lynch were part of a group of dismissed employees whose average age is 54 and who had worked an average of 21 years for the city The mayor rejected the suggestion that the firings were politically motivated  He acknowledged there “will be more changes ” but said he was “not sure” if more layoffs were imminent Other terminated employees included Steven Gregory Dolan  who had worked for the city for more than 39 years  Another  Paul F  McColgan  had 32 years of service  A woman who answered the phone at McColgan’s house said  “It was sudden  that’s all I can say ”The mayor disputed a characterization of the layoffs in the Boston Herald  which quoted an unidentified Walsh aide who described the firings as a “Menino cleansing ” Thomas M  Menino  Boston’s longest serving mayor  left office in January after 20 years and died Oct  30  Walsh said the comment from his unidentified aide “bothered me ”“If I found out who said that  they’d be laid off because that’s nonsense ” Walsh said  “There’s no such thing as a ‘Menino cleansing ’ There are changes  Every administration makes changes  There are certainly plenty of people working around me every single day that Tom Menino brought into that building ”Political appointees not protected by union or civil service status work at the mercy of the election calendar  said Maurice Carroll  assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Poll  A new administration typically brings significant changes to the top of government “It would be surprising to me if they didn’t change ” said Carroll  who covered New York City Hall for decades as a reporter said  “A guy brings in his own people to do his own stuff  A president does  governor does  so why shouldn’t the mayor ”In Boston  Tyler has worked for the research bureau since 1972  spanning four mayoral administrations  There have been significant staffing changes between administrations  Tyler said  but many left of their own accord  Menino dismissed some employees initially  but he knew many people in City Hall because of his time as a councilor “There really wasn’t this kind of situation — public firings  if you will ” Tyler said Walsh took office in January and brought a new wave of employees to City Hall  but it has been difficult to determine how many workers have been purged from previous administrations  The Globe filed a public records request Aug  12 asking for details about city workers who have been fired  Walsh’s administration did not provide the information until Wednesday evening The records show that since Walsh took office  150 workers have retired and 288 permanent employees have resigned or been terminated Employees have been let go as individuals or in small groups  In March  Walsh fired 14 employees at the Boston Redevelopment Authority  That remains the most significant staffing shake up of his administration In the most recent round of layoffs  five of the eight employees were hired by Menino  Two dated to the administration of Kevin H  White  who left office in 1984  and one was hired during Raymond L  Flynn’s tenure At least six of the workers made modest political donations to Menino  according to records filed with the state Office of Campaign and Political Finance  Several had helped with Menino’s campaigns  but none were high ranking political operatives  Lynch  from the parks department  lives in Hyde Park and was a friend of Menino’s Several of the fired employees volunteered for Walsh’s mayoral rival  former councilor John R  Connolly  At least three donated money to Connolly  records show  but not large amounts All eight fired employees had one thing in common  None donated to Walsh’s campaign during last year’s race for mayor  according to records  Walsh said the layoffs were “not about politics ”“If it was about politics  these layoffs would have occurred back in March ” Walsh said  adding  “There are people that worked for John  Connolly  in my administration ”',

332,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"('For some bike share programs in North America  it was a winter of discontent In January  Montreal’s bike share program Bixi filed for bankruptcy  Then  last month  reports surfaced that the operators of New York’s Citi Bike had asked for tens of millions of dollars in aid from the City of New York  nBut in Boston last week  Hubway opened for its fourth season with a rosy financial prognosis  a fresh contract between the City of Boston and bike share operators  an expectation that the system will continue turning a profit  and plans for 10 new stations “We’re in a very  very solid financial place ” said Nicole Freedman  director of the city’s Boston Bikes program  “We’re in a position to fund expansion ” nSome have attributed Hubway’s success to its more conservative choices — closing for winter and launching with a compact system that spread cautiously — as well as its dependence on both public and private money “Bike share systems in Boston  Denver  Chicago  Minneapolis  and Washington  D C   all of which started relatively small and relied on public sector funds  were able to launch with success  iron out kinks  stabilize  and expand quickly ” said Mia Birk  Hubway Bike Share vice president Now  Boston will pay a lower rate for bike share operations with a new contract that stands to allow the city to collect larger profits Previously Boston divided the costs of operating the system 50 50 with Alta Bicycle Share  the contractor that operates and maintains the system’s bikes  stations  software  and memberships  Boston uses public grant money  along with private sponsorships  to pay the city’s share without dipping into municipal coffers — and up until now  Alta and Boston have split the profits in half  It was a risk sharing model favored by former mayor Thomas M  Menino  who was wary of placing the city on the hook if forays into bike share fell flat  Freedman said Now  Boston will pay Alta for the full operations cost  but in turn  the city will take all of the profits from membership fees and advertising — a sign that city officials are confident in the bike share program’s continued profitability  And the city is getting Alta’s services at a new  lower rate  Boston will pay the company about $70 per bike dock per month for maintenance and operations  about a 30 percent reduction from previous operation rates  and well below the average price for other bike share systems  such as the $111 rate paid by Capital Bikeshare in Washington  D C The cities of Cambridge  Somerville  and Brookline — some of which use municipal dollars to help pay their share — are considering whether to switch to Boston’s funding model Hubway’s diversified funding approach has been championed by some as the most stable option In January  Bixi  the company that operated bike shares in Montreal and Toronto and also manufactures bike share equipment  filed for bankruptcy protection  The City of Montreal  which is owed about $30 million from Bixi  has seized the company’s Montreal assets  The City of Toronto has taken over its own bike share operations And New York’s Citi Bike — widely touted for being funded entirely through private sponsorships and membership fees — is now seeking tens of millions of dollars from the City of New York to maintain and expand operations  according to   Citi Bike  also operated by Alta  has proven popular with residents  but a faulty software system and sparse winter ridership  “As with any new industry  there are challenges ” Alta officials said in a statement  adding that the challenges are fixable “and we are working diligently to fix them ”But some  such as Caroline Samponaro  senior director for campaigns and organizing at Transportation Alternatives  a New York City transit advocacy group  think that Citi Bike should adopt Hubway’s model  incorporating corporate sponsorships and public money Starting the system without public funding was necessary in a city where naysayers threatened to prevent the bike share from getting off the ground  she said  But  she continued  government funding is now necessary to ensure stations spread evenly across the city’s neighborhoods “It’s a new thing to think about bike share as a public transit system  but now that’s where we are  and it’s important to bring some amount of subsidy so our program can grow to a scale that’s equitable ” Samponaro said Encouraging an equitable distribution of bikes and stations is also a problem in Boston  where large swaths — East Boston  Dorchester  Roxbury  Mattapan  and Hyde Park — have few or no stations This year  Cambridge embarked on a pilot to test how the system would fare during the winter  Emily Stapleton  Hubway general manager  said ridership in Cambridge was 15 to 20 percent of regular season averages  And there were no Hubway crashes through the winter — a sign of success  said Cara Seiderman  Cambridge’s transportation program manager “It was a very tough winter  and counter to what you might expect  we were very happy about it ” Seiderman said  “It gave us the opportunity to do exactly what we wanted to do with this pilot  figuring out what happens when you have cold and difficult winter ”Still  Cambridge officials have not decided whether year round service will be permanent  Likewise  Freedman said a decision has not been made on whether Boston will experiment with an all seasons operation  With fewer winter riders  she said  each ride becomes more expensive  and that is money that could also be used to expand the system into other neighborhoods  Instead of going year round  she conjectured  the off season could be shortened to just January and February “It really comes down to cost and benefit ” Freedman said  “And if we have a limited amount of money  how do we use that money ”', '2014_589')",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

punch  People winced in pain as news ricocheted from barber shops to boardrooms  dry cleaners to pizza parlors “I just closed my door and sat there and cried ’’ said Marie St  Fleur  a former state representative who later served in Menino’s Cabinet He died just 297 days after walking out of City Hall  It has been more than a century since a Boston mayor passed so soon after leaving office  None served longer than his 20 years “When people think of Boston  they think of Mayor Menino ” said Maryanne Snow  who clutched her chest outside Faneuil Hall when she heard he was gone To many Bostonians  Menino had seemed invincible  a fighter who repeatedly survived serious illnesses  As his health failed  Menino pushed to keep up his relentless pace  He began walking with a cane but not without panache  His walking stick was a baseball bat outfitted with a curved maple handle His death brought politics to a standstill  Days from the Nov  4 election  gubernatorial candidates canceled public appearances  President Obama described him as “bold  big hearted         the embodiment of the city he loved ”His successor  Mayor Martin J  Walsh  held a somber press conference on the steps at City Hall  where behind Walsh stood scores of stone faced lawmakers  city officials  and government workers who got their start on “Team Menino ”Governor Deval Patrick recalled his last bedside visit with the mayor Sunday  when Menino could barely speak  Days earlier  the mayor gave the governor memorable advice “Don’t let the knuckleheads get you down ” Menino told him  according to Patrick People all over the city knew Menino  who famously and prodigiously made a point of meeting ordinary residents They knew him best in his native Hyde Park  Judy Pais has lived across from the Meninos for more than 35 years  After Pais’s father died  the Meninos sent over two turkeys with all the trimmings and cut a trip short to return for the funeral Pais recalled the mayor rising early after storms with a snow blower to clear the sidewalks up and down Chesterfield Street “What other mayor gets out there with a snow blower ” Pais said  “He was a regular guy  He really  really was ”They knew him at the DryDock Cafe  an unassuming restaurant in the Seaport District that his presence helped make into a place for power lunches  Owner Cathy Spiropoulos sometimes saw him three times a week because  she said  “he liked to help out the small person ”In the North End  his longtime barbers — Gino Colafella and Johnny Cammarata — recounted a story that has become barbershop legend  Cammarata gave Menino his first mayoral haircut circa 1994  and Colafella last took scissors to his thinning hair on Oct  4 “When he started with us  he had a full head of hair  He’d say  ‘Can you thin it out ’ u2009” Colafella said  “Then later  he’d say  ‘Don’t cut too much ’ u2009”The hulking edifice of Boston City Hall seemed almost to sag as red eyed secretaries  janitors  and parking clerks whispered the news  Sitting at a parking ticket payments counter  Menino’s former scheduler  Joanne Wallace — her eyes the same color as her red sweater — could barely get the words out “He was an unbelievable guy ’’ said Wallace  who juggled Menino’s nonstop schedule from 1993 to 2011  “He was like a father  He was amazing ”Janitor Rocco Addessa  who has cleaned City Hall for two decades  teared up as he talked about his “old boss ”“He would whack me over the head with his cane  but he was just joking around ” Addessa said  “He was always joking with me ”Meredith Weenick first met Menino in a job interview 12 years ago as a freshly minted Harvard MBA “The interview was brief  direct  and to the point ” said Weenick  a Texan who rose to become the city’s chief financial officer  “He asked me only a handful of questions that were all about me proving how much I cared about Boston because that’s the only thing he cared about ”At Santarpio’s Pizza in East Boston  the staff mourned  Menino often came by for lunch with co workers or his wife and his grandchildren  He loved the barbecue and the pizza  and often took a pizza to go for his son Tommy  a police officer  Often  his waiter was Tony Costanzo  63  a server for more than 30 years Costanzo said Menino always graciously posed for photos with constituents  Other people made Menino happy  Costanzo said  even if they interrupted his lunch  Usually  Menino showed up smiling  but if something was troubling the mayor  “you could read it in his face ”In those moments  Costanzo said  he would greet Menino and then slip away to change the music on the sound system “If you played Frank Sinatra songs  he would smile from ear to ear ” Costanzo said In Dorchester  Menino made an annual Christmas Eve pilgrimage to Bowdoin Street  walking the heart of a neighborhood that struggled with episodic violence  It made a difference  the Rev  Richard “Doc” Conway  a priest at St  Peter Parish  said in an interview “Where are you going to spend your time if you’re going to go out on Christmas Eve  Are you going to go up on Beacon Hill or are you going to do it here ” Conway said  nJose Araujo remembered Menino’s presence 11 years ago when he opened Computers for All on Geneva Avenue   n“He worked all his life  and he couldn’t enjoy his retirement ” Araujo said woefully  “He should have taken off a little earlier  Poor guy ”On Bowdoin Street  Nicole Lewis has three photos from Menino’s visits stashed in a folder behind the counter of the dry cleaner she and her husband have operated for 27 years  Lewis cannot recall seeing a politician in the neighborhood before Menino took office in 1994  But soon  the sight of the mayor became expected “It became a routine ” Lewis said  “He was a good man ”Others recounted Menino in Brighton  Roxbury  and Mattapan  where members of Boston’s black community gathered to pay tribute to the life of a mayor who championed their causes as his own But for many  Menino’s impact was personal  In 1988 when Menino was a councilor  a 22 year old City Hall security guard named Thomas Tinlin caught his eye  Menino began pushing Tinlin to finish college  The day after winning his first election as mayor  Menino called  “I want you to come work for me ” Menino told Tinlin  “but you have to go back to school ”Tinlin earned a bachelor’s degree  then a master’s in public administration  He rose to become one of the longest serving transportation commissioners in Boston history “I don’t know where I would be if Tom Menino hadn’t come into my life and taken a shine to me ” said Tinlin  who is now chief of operations and maintenance for the state’s roads and highways  “I see him everywhere in my life ”As Thursday wore on  Angela Menino returned to the home in Hyde Park that she had

Park  The energetic crowd was diverse  a mix of men and women from a variety of racial  ethnic  and geographic locations And they were Republicans  n“See  See  See ” said Rachel Kemp  the only black woman elected to the Massachusetts Republican State Committee  pointing in jest to the African American  Cuban American  and Haitian American activists in the room Tuesday It was the latest of several recent rallies meant to energize the base for the upcoming election and for Saturday’s party convention at Boston University  where Republicans will gather to nominate candidates for statewide office  nWhat happened during this pre convention rally is the embodiment of the party’s quest to expand its base in a state where registered Democrats outnumber Republicans more than 3 to 1  nTo expand their support  Massachusetts Republicans are reaching out to voters in urban areas and in general to people of color  letting them know there is a place for them in the Grand Old Party  Their pitch  the economy and the disproportionate effect of unemployment among minorities  which according to the Boston Foundation was as high as 33 percent in parts of Roxbury in 2010 “It’s no secret that the reason we lose on Election Day is because we lose in urban cities ” Kirsten Hughes  chairwoman of the Massachusetts Republican Party  said this week before grabbing the microphone to fire up the crowd at the pre convention rally  “It’s not rocket science  We have to go to places we haven’t typically gone ”So the state’s Republican leaders are focusing their outreach on the voters who they say have been failed by the Democratic Party’s policies  while trying to avoid getting mired in the racial and ethnic quagmires plaguing the more right leaning faction of the national party But when a national leader steps on the third rail of cultural politics by saying something contentious about race  poverty  or some other social justice issue  much like Wisconsin congressman Paul Ryan recently did  black and Latino Republicans in Massachusetts say their outreach efforts become that much harder Ryan  the 2012 vice presidential candidate  said in a radio interview  “We have got this tailspin of culture  in our inner cities in particular  of men not working and just generations of men not even thinking about working or learning the value and the culture of work ”Dana Gonsal said he became a Republican five years ago  in large part to ensure that there was a black person in the room to push back against such comments  How can the party become inclusive and culturally attuned if it there are not many people of color present to hold it accountable  he asked “If we’re not in the room  we’ll never be heard ” said Gonsal  who is the Republican chairman of Ward 18  a massive swath of the city anchored by Hyde Park and Mattapan and teeming with residents from Haiti and other Caribbean nations as well as voters of Polish  Italian  and Irish heritage  “You can’t leave it the way it is  You can’t be marginalized  Sometimes  we need to step up to the plate ”He talks about the party of Lincoln and abolitionists  He talks about fiscal responsibility and job creation  He talks about the party as it existed before a Democratic president signed the Civil Rights Act of 1964  which solidified black voters as a Democratic bloc Gonsal said his wife “thinks I’m crazy for being a Republican  but she’s starting to understand ”That wincing reaction is something Robert Fortes said he has become familiar with while campaigning as a black Republican in communities of color  “What’s it like to be a Republican in Boston ” Fortes asked the crowd at Tuesday’s preconvention rally after gubernatorial candidate Charlie Baker pulled him to the microphone to say a few words “Rough ” he answered as Alex Veras  a member of the Massachusetts chapter of a group called the Café Con Leche Republicans  called out  “Tell us how you really feel ”Fortes  who worked in the administration of Governor Mitt Romney  said later that the current political climate creates “an added layer of toughness” in what is already an uphill battle when campaigning for Republican candidates “The biggest response       is  ‘What are you talking about  I support President Obama  I support Deval Patrick ’ ” he said With two black Democrats occupying the seats of power at the White House and the Corner Office of the State House  Fortes said  Republicans have a hard sell with African Americans who support both Obama and Governor Deval Patrick overwhelmingly “You have to get beyond that ” he said  “When you are talking about issues such as charter schools  issues such as jobs  the high unemployment rate of African American males especially  and when you point out who’s been in charge and how a different

before being elected to the State Committee in 2012  And in the decades since registering as a Republican  she said there has been a deterioration of discussion among people of differing viewpoints The persistent need to be right has replaced political persuasion  she said “Dialogue  that’s what’s missing ” said the Dorchester resident  who works in financial services  “Everyone needs to put their piece of the puzzle on the table in order to create the type of United States we’re looking for ”She said she cringes at the way Republicans have put themselves in a position of “always saying no when in fact it’s no  but ”When Republicans in elected office do not fully explain why they reject a bill  like the one extending emergency unemployment benefits  she said it reinforces the narrative that the party does not care about those in need “It comes back as you people don’t care  and I say  ‘That’s not true ’ and I have to find an explanation that extends beyond the word no ” she said  “We have to be able to excite  educate  and then engage  Those are the things we must do  regardless of color  That’s how we are moving to capture more people of color and others in our urban demographic ”The state Republican Party  she said  must do a better job of engaging voters beyond its base  This summer  she said the Massachusetts party is launching a campaign tentatively called “I’m your neighbor” to show the diversity within the party  to show that not all Republicans are wealthy  middle aged white men The campaign will also help reveal some people’s inner Republican  she quipped  adding  “There are a number of small businessmen who are really Republicans but don’t know it  Why do you start a small business  Social mobility  wealth creation  and limited but effective government ”That is the real message  she said', '2014_215')",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Grille in Hyde Park  They headed for the bar and  without a word  the woman stopped just far enough away that the guy could draw the stool back for her They looked up at the TV and the guy said  almost to himself  “Tommy ” t nPaul Brennen  74  knew Tom Menino because they both grew up in Hyde Park  Menino was three grades behind him  Brennen and his partner  Chereel Stafilopathis  watched the blanket coverage of the former mayor’s death intensely  as if it was about someone they cared deeply about  because it was “He grew up on Hyde Park Ave   in a place we called The Island ” Brennen said  “It was the Italian section ”It was also part of the bigger neighborhood known as Readville  which is in itself a smaller part of the section of Boston known as Hyde Park  Before that  they called Readville the Plains or just Low Plains  Before the Civil War  it was actually part of Dedham  not Boston Brennen’s great grandfather came over from Liverpool and wasn’t here long before he found himself drafted into the Civil War  fighting to preserve the union of a country he hadn’t even figured out yet  He went to Camp Meigs in Readville  which was a pretty remarkable place because among those who trained there was the 54th Massachusetts Infantry  the all black unit that fought the Confederacy with a ferocity like no other Readville helped give birth to the very idea of integration in the United States armed forces  one of the first places it was tried  with white officers leading the 54th But almost a century later  when Paul Brennen and Tom Menino were growing up  when an Irish guy married an Italian girl  as Brennen’s father did  people would call it a mi  marriage “I grew up in Corriganville ” Brennen explained  noting yet another subsection in Boston’s most remote neighborhood  “from Dana Ave  down to Truman  I went to Boston Tech  I knew the mayor back then  He was with a crew that used to hang at Dana and Hyde Park Ave ”  nAside from living in the same neighborhood  the other thing Paul Brennen shared with Tom Menino was the sting of being teased and insulted for being Italian “I was half Italian and half Irish  but for some reason some of the Irish kids only looked at the Italian side of my family ” he said  “I got in my first fist fight when a kid called me a guinea  I was 6 years old ”Tom Menino told me a similar story years ago  It was for him  as it was for Brennen  a searing memory  creating in both men a visceral hatred of hatred  whether it was inspired by someone’s ethnicity  color  religion  or sexual orientation “Tom was always very principled ” Brennen said Brennen remembers when Menino lost his job at an insurance company after he took part in efforts to form a union “That’s when he started driving for Joe Timilty ” Brennen said  “That was really the start of his political career  Tom made it happen with hard work  And he never forgot where he came from ”  nBrennen’s career went in a different direction  Like Menino  he got his degree from University of Massachusetts Boston  He ended up working for United Engineers  Back in the mid 1970s  he was waiting for his new administrative assistant to arrive  and when she walked in the door he wasn’t sure it was her  She didn’t look like a Stafilopathis “I was once married to a man from Greece ” Chereel Stafilopathis was saying  “But I am from Honduras originally ”In those early days  sharing work space  working together  Paul and Chereel felt something “There were definite romantic feelings ” Paul remembers Boston was reeling from the violence and unrest that accompanied the desegregation of its public schools  But that isn’t what stopped the budding interracial romance “He moved away ” Chereel said  “He got a job in Philadelphia ”Years went by  Paul remembers rejoicing when Tom Menino won the election in 1993 “I never thought an Italian would become mayor of Boston ” he said  “It was a wonderful feeling ”Chereel  meanwhile  had moved on  taking a pay cut to become a social worker She likes to think of herself as the Tom Menino of social workers  “because the buck stopped with me ”“At one point in my life  I needed services  and I was not treated well ” she said  “I made a vow that if I was ever in that position  I would never let anyone leave feeling the way I did that day  They wouldn’t be debased  If I couldn’t help them  I’d find someone who could  Tom was very much like that  He wouldn’t pass the buck  If he couldn’t help someone  he found somebody who could  That’s how he was as mayor ”About 15 years ago  Paul and Chereel came back into each other’s orbits  This time  they didn’t wait for one or the other to leave again  They’ve been a couple ever since  Wherever they go  from Fairmount Avenue to Commonwealth Avenue  no one bats an eye  Why would they “Tommy made the city better on that front  no doubt  He set a tone on treating everybody the same  Everybody ” Paul Brennen said  “It goes back to when we were kids  No one should be disrespected because of who they are  Tommy got that  Intuitively  In his gut ”He smiled at Chereel and they shared dinner at the bar  watching everybody on TV talking about how their dead friend treated Bostonians the same — no matter where they were born  no matter where they prayed  no matter who they loved — and the old couple nodded as they ate because they knew it was all true  n', '2014_1267')",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

with six siblings  would help her “be my own person ” But  she said  “it’s really hard finding a job ” nEnter Mayor Martin J  Walsh  who is pressing Boston employers at every turn to hire more of the city’s teenagers as he aims to significantly increase the number of young people who can find jobs this summer Walsh’s target  major employers who don’t provide summer jobs for teens  nBy the time school ends  Walsh said in a recent interview  he hopes to have enough commitments from Boston businesses to put more than 10 000 teenagers to work  beating the record of his predecessor    who as mayor made the city’s summer jobs program a national model “If we can get to 12 000 kids working for the summertime  both public and private  that’s a big number ” Walsh said  “I’m aiming for that  I’m pretty competitive  I would like to hit that goal ”Walsh’s efforts come as economists describe the nation’s teen job crisis as a problem of Great Depression proportions  Nearly five years after the recession ended  the unemployment rate among teens nationwide remains above 20 percent  compared with less than 7 percent for all workers A big part of the problem for young people  economists say  is a still weak job market is forcing many older workers to take lower paying jobs once done by teens A   a Washington think tank  found that teens are squeezed out of the job market in record numbers  Over the past decade or so  the percentage of working teens in the United States plunged by nearly half  to just 24 percent in 2011 from 44 percent in 2000 Even in Boston  which has one of the nation’s most active and best funded youth employment programs  only 1 in 3 teens had jobs  according to the study Walsh and youth advocates say local businesses have to do more  Only about one third of Boston employers participate in the city’s summer jobs program “The private sector really needs to step up ” said Dan Gelbtuch  a community organizer for the Youth Jobs Coalition  an advocacy group Economists say that summer and part time jobs play an important role for teens and the broader labor market because they can provide the experiences  skills  and sense of responsibility that help teens succeed over the course of their working lives The Brookings study found that persistent lack of a paying job can lead to prolonged joblessness  Teens who had paid employment in one year were more likely to work the following year  the study found  while those who could not find jobs one year were likely to end up unemployed the next David Campbell  17  of Hyde Park  said he has been looking for a summer or after school job for more than a year  He said he has applied for scores of jobs at grocery stores  restaurants  and retail stores  but has yet to be contacted for an interview He said he needs the money to buy clothes and shoes and to pay a portion of his cellphone bill “Heard back from zero ” the high school football player said  “I just want to get a job  It doesn’t matter where  as long as I get one ”The city under Menino allocated $4 3 million to hire teens for jobs in parks and other city services  and Walsh said he will propose funding the program at the same level this year  The state has committed to allocating more than $9 million to support youth jobs programs statewide Youth groups and community organizers  meanwhile  are advocating more fiercely for increased participation of the business community  Last year  the Youth Jobs Coalition identified 300 companies with more than 100 employees that don’t hire teens during the summer  including the Uno restaurant chain  Big Four accounting firm Ernst   Young  and private equity company Bain Capital Those companies did not respond to requests for comment Employers who participate in the city’s summer jobs program  such as John Hancock Financial  State Street Bank  and Fidelity Investments  say the effort helps them give back to the community John Hancock employs about 20 young people in summer jobs at its headquarters and pays to put another 630 to work at area nonprofits  from Artists for Humanity to Boys   Girls Clubs “We always try to help  as a corporate citizen ” said Tom Crohan  an assistant vice president at John Hancock  “Teens get a meaningful experience learning new skills  making money  and supporting the important work of a community organization ”Walsh’s office did not disclose how many commitments it has collected from employers willing to provide summer jobs  But the mayor said he raises the subject in every meeting and speech with business leaders Menino typically ended his annual speech at the Boston Municipal Research Bureau to business leaders with a plea to hire the city’s youth in the summer  Walsh  who as a teen worked at the Andrew Square

wider  They had started on the same red line in the gymnasium  then edged forward or backward depending on how they answered such questions as whether they had been targeted by racial slurs or had known someone killed by violence  By the end of the exercise  most white participants wound up at the front of the gym  and most black attendees toward the back   n“How does it feel to be where you are ” a facilitator asked What unfolded next was a frank discussion about race and racism  with participants pondering the role skin color may have played in their lives  Not exactly the kind of discussion they would broach during chance encounters on the schoolyard or at the PTO bake sale In a school system where race remains a highly sensitive topic 40 years after desegregation polarized the city  Roosevelt is among a growing number of schools tackling the issue head on  holding a series of “race dialogues” with small groups of parents and teachers  The program  which started four years ago with the YWCA  aims to bridge an unspoken  and often unintentional  racial divide  Organizers hope the talks will build a more cohesive community that will lead to greater involvement by all parents  reduce gaps in achievement among students of different backgrounds  and instill more trust in schools For many parents who grew up in Boston  stepping inside a city school can bring back painful memories of court ordered busing  n“Race is such a key issue in BPS ” said Becky Shuster  a Roosevelt parent who is white and one of the creators of the talks  “The issue of race infiltrates every aspect of our community  from the challenges of the achievement gap to the school assignment process to our values ”So far  dialogues have been held in five Boston schools  including Curley K 8 in Jamaica Plain and Gardner Pilot Academy in Allston But more schools should have the talks  said Carroll Blake  executive director of the school system’s achievement gap initiatives  adding that they hold great potential in eradicating racism About 83 percent of students in the Boston public schools identify as black  Hispanic  or Asian  only 13 percent are white “When you talk about race  people get nervous or scared  it’s like opening a Pandora’s box ” Blake said  “But when we don’t talk about it  it’s like the elephant in the room ”In a school system that has seen an infusion of families from dozens of countries  the quiet divide among parents has moved considerably away from the classic black and white paradigm that dominated the busing crisis  requiring a more complex solution  Parents not only have to bridge numerous cultural  religious  and economic differences  but also in many cases language barriers Parents and administrators at the Mendell Elementary School in Roxbury picked up on this awkward divide a few years ago  as more middle class families  largely white ones  sent their children to the school  The new parents  fired up to help boost the school’s fortunes  revitalized the parent council  started new afterschool clubs  and hosted fund raisers Yet they struggled to get much participation from parents of the other children  Principal Julia Bott  who had created a family engagement team to get all parents involved  decided to give the race dialogues a try The talks led to subtle changes at the school  such as parents of different backgrounds making more of an effort to talk with one another on the schoolyard  parents said “We got to know people we didn’t know before ” said Jennifer Rodine  co president of the parent council  “It’s natural for people to talk with people they know or share the same language  That shifted after the dialogues ”Across Boston  schools experiencing the most pronounced but silent divide among parents are those in neighborhoods undergoing gentrification  While middle class families can bring more energy and resources to the schools their children attend  their efforts can come with unintentional downsides  said Susan Naimark  who teaches at the Graduate School of Education at the University of Massachusetts Boston and who wrote “The Education of a White Parent  Wrestling with Race and Opportunity in the Boston Public Schools ’’“We want middle class families to use the schools  but often what happens is those parents become the ones who are the most active  who do the big fund raising  and decide where the funds go ” said Naimark  a former Boston School Committee member  “The more active that group becomes  the more other groups feel alienated ”For many black parents who grew up in Boston  scars from segregation may keep them away from schools — places in their childhood perceived as unwelcoming and that in many cases offered a substandard education  experts said  In other cases  some immigrant groups come from countries where volunteering at a school is not part of their culture But these parents often are involved in their children’s education in other ways  such as helping with homework or stressing the importance of school Michele Brooks  assistant superintendent of Boston’s Office of Family and Student Engagement  said she hears from schools all the time seeking advice about how best to create a more cohesive community among parents  “We have made progress  but we still have a lot of work to do around this ” she said In the talks  facilitators encourage parents and teachers to talk openly without fear of offending anyone   n“Just put it out there and we will fix it ” Rosa Hunter  a facilitator  told the Roosevelt participants before the gym activity After the last question was asked inside the gym  many participants appeared at ease discussing their ending places  White participants tended to express guilt for being out front  while black participants expressed frustration about being further behind “I felt a little uncomfortable the more separated I got from the people I’m close to ” said one mother  who is white  “We live on the same street  We go to the same school  Our kids play together  We belong together ”But another mother  who is black  said that “no one should feel guilty ”“I’m striving to get the same things for my kids ” she said Shuster  director of training at the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination  pushed for the dialogues at Roosevelt about four years ago  gaining the backing of then principal Emily Glasgow  At the time  all leadership positions on the parent council were held by white parents Since then  about 70 Roosevelt parents have participated in the dialogues  which are credited with helping to diversify the ranks of the parent council’s leadership  Dacia Campbell  who is black  said she doubted she would have thought of joining the council and becoming its co president had she not participated in the talks four years ago “Parent councils are not traditionally made up of people of color  and you wonder if they might be cliquey ” Campbell said  “When I found out that was not the

shift in the city’s economy to knowledge based industries such as life sciences and technology has provided new business opportunities for boutique manufacturers that use 3 D printers and other sophisticated equipment If only those companies had a place of their own in Boston  t nThe rapid redevelopment of former industrial areas such as the Seaport District has left Boston with less than 5 percent of its land zoned for just industrial uses  Now  at an abandoned rail yard on the outskirts of the city  officials hope a new project will help them lure industry back to Boston The “Yard 5” development is a group of low slung buildings that will be built on former MBTA land in Hyde Park that will offer studio sized industrial workspaces  each from 4 000 to 7 000 square feet  to as many as 51 businesses  The developers expect to receive the go ahead from City Hall soon  and already Boston officials are shopping the Yard 5 units to prospective tenants around the country  telling companies that the development shows Boston is serious about restoring its industrial sector “We want to bring manufacturing jobs back to the city ” said John Barros  Boston’s chief of economic development  “If we’re not paying attention to those types of jobs  our economic ecosystem is weaker  and we’re not as attractive to these companies and institutions ”Yard 5 will consist of five one story light industrial buildings and a three story office building  The studios will have robust high voltage electrical systems  high ceilings  loading docks  and other features prized by industrial businesses “Most of the manufacturing and industrial businesses in Boston own or lease functionally obsolete facilities  and have to rehab them at great expense to stay there ” said Matthew O’Connor  vice president at First Highland Management and Development Corp   the Yard 5 developer  “This is a rare opportunity to have a modern facility with a Boston address ”Work on the 21 acre site  the subject of an intensive environmental cleanup by the MBTA in 2011  is scheduled to begin next March  Two buildings will be erected next year  construction of the remaining buildings should begin in spring 2017  First Highland  which already operates the Boston Dedham Commerce Park nearby  said the project would create 100 temporary construction jobs O’Connor expects to draw a diverse mix of small businesses  from medical device makers and robotics companies  general contractors  and other building trades  He thinks the project’s modest sized units and location across from the Readville commuter rail station will be particularly attractive to companies that do “smart” industrial work  such as product development and prototypes  and are trying to hire young people from local universities who want to live in the city “Yard 5 is on a micro scale  and that’s appealing ” said Kevin Hanna  a principal at real estate firm Cassidy Turley who specializes in industrial and commercial properties  “For people trying to develop products  being able to perfect it locally where the brainpower is — that’s very interesting ”In First Highland’s pitch to city regulators  the company suggested the project’s modular  customizable units could be ideal “makerspaces ” These are workshops shared by a rotating cast of artisans and inventors who pay membership fees to use the space and equipment  Others in the region are thriving  In Somerville  the nonprofit Artisan’s Asylum has attracted a roster full of small manufacturing firms whose employees “hack” bicycles  tinker with robots  and brew beer in its warehouse space “The makerspace movement is real  and if you don t have light industrial space for them  you’re going to lose those businesses ” Barros said  explaining that a recent visit to Industry City  a campus of historic warehouses in Brooklyn that have been converted into industrial space for startups and artists  had left him feeling jealous  “We’d be foolish not to include them in our planning ”But some involved in the makerspace movement are doubtful that Yard 5 will be a fit for these business  a makerspace  they argue  doesn’t start with empty buildings  but a community of tinkerers “What startups need is not space  It’s knowledge and connections more than anything ” said Rich Breault  founder of Lightspeed Manufacturing  which collaborates with the MassChallenge accelerator program to help young companies manufacture products  “I’m sure there are economic advantages to being down there from a cost standpoint  but where’s the advice  support  and guidance  It’s all about the community and building a team ”Breault suggested Yard 5 would be a better fit for more mature startups that have completed a round or two of fund raising and have a well developed product  He worried that the somewhat remote location of Yard 5 — in a far corner of the city with few of the restaurants and street life the startup community thrives on — could be a turnoff Yard 5 may eventually seem less removed if more frequent light rail service  expected to begin at Readville station in 2018  comes to fruition  n“It’s a lot about the talent and demographics ” said Hanna  the broker  “I’ve seen plenty of similar developments succeed in the suburbs  but young people want to live in the city ”First Highland  Hanna said  “could be onto something ” n', '2014_524')",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hyde Park  where mourners crowded his childhood church for a funeral that offered an intimate glimpse of the man who led Boston’s renaissance Menino chose simplicity even in death  eschewing a majestic service at a cathedral for a Mass at the modest brick church where he was baptized 71 years ago  Luminaries crowded the wooden pews of Most Precious Blood Church  Vice President Joe Biden and basketball legend Bill Russell  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and baseball slugger David Ortiz  t nEulogists rhapsodized about the major accomplishments in Menino’s unprecedented 20 year run as mayor  He was the champion of the underdog  the master of fixing potholes and other nagging problems of urban life  and the healer who helped soothe Boston’s racial strife and make the city more welcoming But after four days of public anguish since his death  the Mass offered views of Menino that most of Boston rarely saw in his five terms as mayor The funeral was a look inside his home on Chesterfield Road  as Mitchell B  Weiss recalled eating tripe and agreeing to serve as the mayor’s chief of staff  It was Governor Deval Patrick describing Menino’s “famous eye roll — that  ‘gimme a break ’ whenever he thought the comment or situation was ridiculous ” It was the crack in the voice of his 15 year old granddaughter “We all called him Papa ” Olivia Fenton said His 16 year old granddaughter  Samantha Menino  recounted that she thought he would be mayor forever unless he was carried out of office kicking and screaming  She relished her grandfather’s position “Every time it snowed out  I called Papa to make sure he knew school needed to be canceled ” Samantha Menino said  eliciting laughter from the crowd  “He reminded me that children in Boston relied on school lunch and if they didn’t go to school  they wouldn’t have a warm place to stay ”The day marked a distinct point in the long arc of Boston’s history as the city bade farewell to its longest serving mayor  Menino held office for 20 years  five months  and 25 days  He left in January and died of cancer less than 10 months after walking out of City Hall The governor recalled asking for Menino’s support as a political neophyte with few volunteers and no money  “No ” Menino said — because he was already committed to someone else  But then the mayor spoke to Patrick for an hour at a time when the future governor was a political nobody “Tom Menino  thank you for being my friend ” Patrick said  “for making time for the meek as well as the mighty  for coaching this newcomer as you have so many others  and for the exceptional example of honest public service not just as the job you did  but the man you were ”Bill Clinton paid his respects at Faneuil Hall before Menino took his final ride home to Hyde Park  It was a crisp  sunny day  fitting for a send off for a mayor who once joked he could control everything but the weather Thousands lined the city’s streets as Menino’s casket passed touchstones in his life  City Hall  where he worked for 30 years  Fenway Park  where he held season tickets  Bowdoin Geneva  the Dorchester neighborhood he visited each Christmas Eve  and Roslindale Square  where he made good on his first campaign promise to reinvigorate the business district When the procession reached Most Precious Blood  the church overflowed with 700 people in the nave and 300 more in the basement  At least 10 priests crowded the altar  including Cardinal Sean P  O’Malley The audience included lawyers and community activists  business executives and police officers  social workers and religious leaders Mostly  it was Menino’s family  That included relatives — his wife  Angela  and siblings  children  and grandchildren — and his City Hall family  The mayor’s political organization “Team Menino” sprang back to life in the last few days to ensure a fitting farewell for the mayor  In his eulogy  Weiss spoke directly to his former boss as he recounted the effort “Team Menino loved you and they called again and again over the last four days to say  ‘What can I do to help ’ u2009” Weiss said  “A machine  the outsiders called it  But how could it be  It had your big  beating heart ”Humor leavened the pain  Weiss said he could still see Menino in his dining room  pestering his 2 year old daughter  Hannah  for ice cream “I can still see her shaking her head  ‘No ’ u2009” Weiss said  pausing for effect “It’s a good thing ” he continued  “she didn’t need building permits ”The church erupted in laughter  a welcome balm for a congregation bathed in grief  But the levity did little to mask Weiss’s grief that Menino died so soon after leaving office “He wasn’t supposed to be here yet ” Weiss said  “He was supposed to have more time  Not more time to relax  but more time to be in the mix of things  He always wanted to be in the mix of things ”Menino’s successor  Martin J  Walsh  said the former mayor had “gone to fix potholes in heaven ”Walsh recalled that when Menino took office in 1993  urban flight had decimated Boston  In his first speech as elected mayor  Menino appealed to people who were thinking of moving out of the city  Menino said their decision mattered to him personally  Menino promised  Walsh said  to dedicate his time as mayor to giving them a reason to stay “The truth is ” Walsh said  “he dedicated his life to giving us a reason to stay ”In his homily  the Rev  John J  Connolly Jr  opened a window into Menino’s spiritual life  The priest held up two dog eared prayer books that he said Menino used so frequently that pages fell out Connolly recalled a prediction Menino made in high school when a nun asked him what he wanted to do with his life  “I’m going to build bridges ” Menino told the nun “The bridges he built between and among the neighbors and neighborhoods of this city and peoples near and far are perhaps his most worthy monument ” Connolly said Throughout the eulogies and songs  Angela Menino remained resolute in the front pew  She had been married to Menino for 48 years  Patrick addressed her directly “Angela  I know your heart is broken  He told me once that his favorite thing in the world  even better than shopping  was to be home with you for dinner ” Patrick said  “It seems especially sad that he would be taken just at the point when you got his undivided attention ”Outside the church  Dianna Valentin Grullon dabbed tears with a blue scarf “There is not going to be another one like him ’’ she said  “I miss him much already  He’s a good human being ”The casket was draped in a baby blue City of Boston flag and hoisted out of the church by uniformed police officers  for one last trip to Fairview Cemetery A vocalist and keyboardist  standing outside the church where they were framed by fluttering flags  performed Frank Sinatra’s “My Way ” The song held special meaning for “Team Menino ”When he became acting mayor on June 12  1993  they held a celebratory block party on Chesterfield Road  and Menino

things ” who had wrought major change in the city He also spoke about Menino’s “agenda for racial healing” and drive to make Boston a “welcoming place for people of color and immigrants ”Patrick  who

death of Boston’s longest serving mayor  nDuring the nearly 10 months he spent outside of City Hall  the 71 year old Menino maintained a hectic schedule  even after being diagnosed with cancer It was vintage Menino  If he was in pain  he rarely showed it Still  those close to the former mayor said Friday  the final months of his life were among the most difficult  defined by his treatment for cancer and his withdrawal from 18 hour days as mayor that had been like oxygen to him “It comes to that point that you just can’t do what you were doing 10 or 20 years ago ’’ said Kevin Phelan  a friend and real estate developer  “That’s a painful  painful day of reflection  My gut is that he went through a lot of that ”“He kept the health issues very close to the vest ” Phelan said  “He didn’t want sympathy ”Instead  the mayor was on the move  attending family events  public speeches  and various causes “This was not retirement ’’ said Katharine Lusk  executive director of the Initiative on Cities  which Menino founded at Boston University after leaving office  “He did not have a seven day a week schedule  But he had a five day a week schedule ”He took up driving again for the first time in a long time  and learned to use an iPhone  mastering the popular game Candy Crush  He relied on his Louisville Slugger cane or a wheelchair to get around “He was in good spirits ’’ said his biographer Jack Beatty  who wrote “Mayor for a New America ” “He had a little monitoring device for the chemotherapy  But he was always joking       and accepting the good natured ribbing from his friends  his staff  and his wife ”Menino seemed to thrive from the adulation of the public  including many who sought him out for counsel  BU students flocked to Menino for insight into what it is like to run a big city for two decades  Struggling mayors from other cities sought his help  Old acquaintances turned to him for life and career advice  He kept in constant contact with his old aides at City Hall  some were at his bedside when he died Usually  he would ask them  “What’s going on ”Menino mustered enough strength to travel to New York in mid October for a book party  He was last seen at a public event Oct  16  a book signing at BU  He looked tired  some in attendance said  but patiently signed his book for students  friends  and faculty waiting in line “He had something personal to say to everybody who was there  It was really extraordinary ’’ said professor Anthony Janetos  who directs BU’s Frederick S  Pardee Center for the Study of the Longer Range Future  which worked with Menino’s initiative Later that day  Menino was admitted to Brigham and Women’s Hospital Friends and observers said Menino’s last 297 days were lived with new purpose  After a family trip in January  he returned to Boston  recalibrating the adrenaline of public office  There were things to do  even as his body failed him At the annual Martin Luther King Jr  breakfast in January  Menino walked to the stage to accept an award for his dedication to public service  Governor Deval Patrick was among those who helped Menino up some stairs to the stage  He gingerly made it to the microphone  He was not deterred  speaking of Boston’s turnaround as a diverse and understanding city About a month later  Menino joined the board at Blue Hills Bank in Hyde Park  Initially  he was not thrilled that the bank had changed its name from Hyde Park Savings Bank  but Menino came around  He attended monthly board meetings and even called prospective customers as the bank expanded  said Bill Parent

Anselm College in New Hampshire  He visited Red Sox spring training in Florida He joined some 2 500 people at the Hynes Veterans Memorial Convention Center during the April 15 remembrance of the Boston Marathon bombings  A day later  Menino traveled to New Orleans to deliver the keynote speech at a preservation conference  Menino also visited with Mayor Mitchell Landrieu and his department heads Menino kept things light as well  He teamed with Eliot Tatelman  chief executive of Jordan’s Furniture  on one of the chain’s iconic commercials “I called him up and I knew he wasn’t feeling well  and I said to him  ‘Wouldn’t it be great for you to let the public see you in a Red Sox uniform ’ ’’ Tatelman recalled Menino agreed and arrived at Fenway Park in a wheelchair  He then got up and moved around  One spot shows Menino and Tatelman conducting a conversation by exchanging baseball signs  Another seemingly shows Menino clubbing a homer with his cane  Menino refused payment for his cameos  Instead  Tatelman said he gave Boston’s stylish mayor two dozen fancy ties Menino made time to return to Dorchester’s Bowdoin Geneva neighborhood in mid May and was honored with his own bench outside the St  Peter Teen Center At BU  Menino worked on a survey of 70 mayors by his Initiative on Cities  which aims to pinpoint priorities and challenges in cities  Menino teamed with Lusk  the initiative’s president  and assistant professors Katherine Levine Einstein and David Glick Glick said that at times he sensed the mayor’s legendary impatience as he injected a sense of urgency into academia  Menino held meetings on Fridays  even in summer  when colleges campuses settle into a somnolent pace “He normally dressed like the mayor at work ’’ Glick recalled  “One Friday afternoon in the summer  he was wearing sneakers and a polo shirt  He jokingly told me  because I often dress like that — that he was now dressing like an academic ”Einstein said she was initially intimidated to meet with Menino and chose to wear a work dress instead of the normal summer casual fare Menino pushed the professors to include questions in the survey about the environment and sustainability  He urged them to ask mayors to differentiate between their policy priorities and issues on which they were willing to spend political capital  He never let on that his illness was wearing on him “You would have no idea  at least in my professional interaction with him ’’ Glick said  “He was very engaged  working a pretty aggressive schedule ”On Oct  4  Menino drove himself to visit his barber at Johnny   Gino’s in the North End  He took the only seat by the massive store window  next to a picture taken 20 years ago of his first haircut there as mayor At the book signing two weeks ago  Menino looked tired  the cancer raging “It had been a long week  but he just      ’’ said Lusk  breaking midsentence to weep  “Everyone whose book he signed felt so special ”Phelan said chemotherapy took its

economy and shape the skyline and the very identity of the city he loved through an unprecedented five consecutive terms in City Hall  died Thursday  He was 71 and was diagnosed with advanced cancer not long after leaving office at the beginning of this year “Visionaries don’t get things done ” he once said  crisply separating himself from politicians who gaze at distant horizons and imagine what might be  Leaving to others the lofty rhetoric of Boston as the Athens of America  he took a decidedly ground level view of the city on a hill  earning himself a nickname for his intense focus on the nuts and bolts of everyday life  the urban mechanic  t nAn old school politician whose own smarts owed more to the streets than the college classroom  Menino nonetheless helped turn Boston into a hub of 21st century innovation  recruiting high tech companies to the sprawling South Boston waterfront one minute  then cutting the ribbon at a neighborhood burrito shop the next  “No man possessed a greater love for our city  and his dedicated life in service to Boston and her people changed the face of the city ” said his successor  Mayor Martin J  Walsh  “With sheer determination and unmatched work ethic  he took a city that is not as big in size as we are in stature and put us on the world stage as a national leader in health care  education  innovation  and the nitty gritty of executing basic city services ”“Because of his leadership ” Walsh added  “Boston is a better place today ”Dot Joyce  Mr  Menino’s longtime spokeswoman  said in a statement that “just after 9 a m  this morning the Honorable Thomas M  Menino passed into eternal rest after a courageous battle with cancer  He was surrounded by his devoted wife  Angela  loving family and friends ” In a statement Thursday  President Obama said Mr  Menino was “bold  big hearted  and Boston strong ”“Tom was the embodiment of the city he loved and led for more than two decades ” Obama said  “As Boston’s longest serving mayor  Tom helped make his hometown the vibrant  welcoming  world class place it is today  His legacy lives on in every neighborhood he helped revitalize  every school he helped turn around  and every community he helped make a safer  better place to live ”A few weeks into Mr  Menino’s summer tenure as acting mayor in 1993  when some pundits fancied him a temporary caretaker  he offered a seemingly modest ambition  “I want to help people  help one individual a day  Just to make their life a little bit better ”His landslide election that fall to a first full term inaugurated a 20 year run as mayor  Deftly managing the city’s finances  Mr  Menino guided Boston’s commercial growth through roller coaster peaks and dips in the national economy  largely allowing the city to avoid the massive budget cuts that plagued other urban centers in the throes of the 2008 2009 downturn  nThroughout his years as mayor  development accelerated as the city added millions of square feet of new buildings  Wielding the power of his office  Mr  Menino could make development deals flourish — or shatter them just as swiftly  Known for his micromanaging  which at times drew criticism  he once intervened to personally approve the design of a Back Bay tower’s crown like peak For constituents  Mr  Menino was the perennial mayor in their midst  a constant presence at neighborhood events  More than half of the Bostonians who responded to a 2008 Globe poll said they had met him personally  Anyone who watched the mayor stroll through neighborhoods from Bowdoin Geneva to West Roxbury might think that figure far too low  nMr  Menino’s health had declined in recent years  and he was hospitalized with a broken leg three days before the bombings occurred at the 2013 Boston Marathon  Checking himself out against his doctor’s advice  he attended the first news conference and three days later pushed himself out of his wheelchair to stand at the pulpit and speak at an interfaith service  “We are one Boston ” he said that day  “No adversity  no challenge  nothing can tear down the resilience in the heart of this city and its people ”A politician with a flashing temper  whose skin could be as thin as his victory margins were thick  Mr  Menino was Boston’s first mayor of Italian descent  After that first landslide in 1993  his reelection margins never dropped below 15 percentage points and were as high as 49 points  His time in office also straddled a significant demographic shift when the number of white residents in the city fell below 50 percent  and as Boston changed  he built a vaunted Democratic political machine  A protégé of Joseph Timilty  a former city councilor and state senator  Mr  Menino landed his first government jobs with his mentor’s assistance and knew firsthand how to use patronage Reaching beyond his solid base  Mr  Menino courted disparate constituencies that other candidates ignored or paid too little heed  such as African Americans  gays and lesbians  and conservatives in East Boston “If  100 years from now  they look back at my election  I hope what they see is the beginning of a century of inclusive politics ” Mr  Menino said in January 1994 at Faneuil Hall as part of his first State of the City address  “Throughout my whole career I have tried to be an open door to people left out of the mainstream  As mayor  I intend to continue that ”Robert E  Travaglini  a former state Senate president who served with Mr  Menino on the City Council  said that “Tommy Menino always followed his instincts and did what his heart and his head told him to do  For years  people were overlooked and underserved  He focused on those portions of the population  and he championed their causes  and they responded ”Stung as a boy by disparaging treatment from teachers dismissive of his Italian American heritage  Mr  Menino stressed in his first mayoral campaign that he would “not tolerate racism  I will never tolerate people being discriminated against ” He opposed bias of any kind  and few gestures were as potent as his decision early on to march in the city’s gay pride parade  while shunning South Boston’s traditional St  Patrick’s Day parade because it banned groups advocating for lesbian and gay rights  Years later  when the state began permitting same sex marriages on May 17  2004  Mr  Menino was waiting at City Hall to greet Julie and Hillary Goodridge  who were first in line  As lead plaintiffs  they had lent their name to the state Supreme Judicial Court case that legalized gay marriage six months earlier  n“Tom Menino personally experienced the injustice of prejudice ” Travaglini said  “He watched it with his family  with his parents and his grandparents  He experienced it politically  And it had a lasting impression  nUS Senator Edward J  Markey said that “in every neighborhood across this city  Boston will mourn today after losing this great mayor  but we will fill that void with the love and respect we have for the life and the legacy of Tom Menino  Boston loves Tom Menino because Tom Menino loved Boston with all of his heart ”Mr  Menino was City Council president when President Bill Clinton appointed Mayor Raymond L  Flynn ambassador to the Vatican  “Go out and get some new suits  you’re going to be acting mayor ” he recalled Flynn telling him when the ambassador discussions were afoot  On July 19  1993  Mr  Menino was sitting in his council office when an aide appeared at 4 20 p m  to say Flynn had formally resigned  The council president automatically succeeds a mayor who departs in the middle of a term  That night  Mr  Menino and his wife  Angela  danced at a Hyde Park block party to “My Way ” a favorite tune that became a de facto theme song — played again as the Meninos walked into Faneuil Hall on March 28  2013  when he announced he would not seek a sixth term “For 20 years  Boston has been lucky to have Tom Menino in the mayor’s office ” the Globe’s editorial board wrote the next day  “The city has improved in almost every respect  Menino wasn’t personally responsible for every positive development — many cities enjoyed the benefits of lower crime rates and a return to urban living — but he guided the changes with impressive political skills and finesse ”Nearly two decades earlier  after Mr  Menino was elected Boston’s 53d mayor on Nov  2  1993  Clinton called with congratulations  “Thank you  Mr  President  for making the mayor ambassador ” Mr  Menino said  nPlain spoken sentiments were a trademark of Mr  Menino  who often was famously tongue tied and prone to malapropisms  His swallowed words may have inspired the painful “Mumbles” nickname he wished would fade  but voters didn’t seem to mind  perhaps sensing in his labored language the wisdom of a common man who had done uncommonly well “Like people who give great speeches are great public officials  I mean  just look at the officials who give great speeches — they haven’t done a thing in their career  but they just look good or sound good ” Mr  Menino told the Globe in July 1993  “I’d like to see what they’ve done in their careers  What’s their record  Who have they helped ”While serving as acting mayor  he noted that a neighborhood newspaper headline had called him “Action mayor Tom Menino ” and said that if elected he would try to live up to the typo  Before facing voters that fall  he froze water rates  worked to bolster the city’s community policing effort  earmarked $1 million for housing for the elderly  and set aside $500 000 to fund summer jobs for youth  that last item a policy initiative to which he returned year after year  “It was the beginning of something big ” he later recalled  nHe handily defeated state Representative James T  Brett in November  ending a run of Irish American mayors that stretched back decades  Mr  Menino received 64 4 percent of the vote to Brett’s 35 6 percent  one of Boston’s largest mayoral victories in the latter part of the 20th century  Though hard fought  the campaign was largely amicable  and even after the candidates preserved a strong relationship As he easily was reelected four times  Mr  Menino kept up a punishing pace  rising early to crisscross the city  Kevin H  White  the four term mayor who preceded Flynn  pioneered little city halls in outer neighborhoods  At times  Mr  Menino seemed to embody them  White and Flynn both yearned for the national stature of higher offices  For Mr  Menino  being mayor was a calling of the highest order On that November 1993 morning after he was first elected  the difference from the day before was apparent  “When you’re acting mayor  some people return your phone calls ” Mr  Menino said  “When you’re mayor  everyone returns your phone calls ”And everyone around him quickly learned that no cog in the vast machinery of city government was too small to escape his attention  En route to the office each day he called subordinates to report on what needed fixing or sprucing up  a pothole here  a broken streetlight there  an abandoned car that needed towing  a neighborhood park in need of mowing  Except for his ever present finely tailored suits  Mr  Menino was more workhorse than showhorse  earning his “urban mechanic” nickname neighborhood by neighborhood  street by street “I didn’t learn anything sitting in this room ” Mr  Menino told the Globe in July 2013  in his fifth floor City Hall office  “I’d rather be out there  talking to the people  This job  my legacy  is about the people ”For two decades  until his final December  Mr  Menino spent Christmas Eve touring the streets of the Bowdoin Geneva neighborhood  initially on foot and later by SUV when his health declined  “I’ll never say goodbye ” he said last December as he met once more with people  pastors  and business owners in a neighborhood that has seen more than its share of violence  gangs  and drugs  “I’ll be back here next year  the year after  and the year after  Not as mayor  but as a person who cares about what’s going on in the neighborhood ”Cardinal Seán P  O’Malley said it was “a blessing for me to have known Tom and Angela since the time I arrived in Boston and to share in their faith and their good works  They always held providing support and assistance for people in need as a priority ”Some criticized Mr  Menino’s unstinting devotion to minutiae  saying it diverted him from larger issues  In 1996  for example  he said voters should “judge me harshly” if he failed to improve the education system  Graduation rates remained comparatively flat through much of his tenure  only rising in recent years  and city schools also experienced persistent racial achievement gaps  Still  he appointed two longstanding Boston Public Schools superintendents  providing much needed stability for a school system that was shaken by the busing crisis and an extended period of short term superintendents  Beginning in 1995  Thomas Payzant served nearly 11 years  Carol Johnson was in the job six years until retiring last year  nNo stranger to the academic challenges children face  Mr  Menino was a C student at St  Thomas Aquinas High School in Jamaica Plain and resisted his father’s insistence that he pursue higher education  “When I’d get after him to go to college  he’d say  ‘Truman never went to college ’ u2009” Mr  Menino’s father  Carl  who died in 1989  said in a 1983 WGBH TV documentary  adding  “He told me that a thousand times ”Only after being elected to the City Council in 1983 did Mr  Menino take to heart a mentor’s advice that he needed a college education if he wanted to advance  He graduated at 45  through a program that gave him a chunk of credits for serving as a city councilor  By that measure  when a bachelor’s degree at last arrived  he essentially had majored in being Tom Menino Though not averse to being addressed “mayor ” he remained a man of his neighborhood  often leaving phone messages identifying himself simply as Tom or Tommy  In his memoir “Mayor for a New America ” which was written with Jack Beatty and released Oct  14  he wrote about his beginnings in Hyde Park  the southernmost section of Boston that most politicians considered “the sticks ”Born Dec  27  1942  he was the oldest of three children  Mr  Menino’s father was part of the machinists union and worked 35 years at a Westinghouse plant  where he helped the future mayor land a summer job during high school  “By then my dad was a foreman ” Mr  Menino wrote  “I noticed how he heard the men out  It was his way of showing respect  That was my first lesson in politics ”Mr  Menino’s mother  Susan  “was a Mother Teresa to new immigrants in Hyde Park ” he wrote  The Meninos lived on the first floor of a two family house on Hyde Park Avenue and his paternal grandparents  immigrants from a village in southern Italy  lived upstairs The family owned an apartment building next door  where new immigrants cycled through every few years until they saved enough for a place of their own  Fluent in Italian  Mr  Menino’s mother helped them with bills  schools  and job applications  “every stage of their journey to America ”“I was 21 when she died with my 6 year old brother  David  in her arms ” he said  adding that his father’s grief “was total  like his love ” He wrote that his mother “was the strongest influence on my life ” inspiring his compassion for Boston’s newcomers and those struggling to succeed Mr  Menino noted in his memoir that he faced his own struggles at school  where “because my teeth and lips would not cooperate  I talked out of the side of my mouth  mumbling decades before I was called ‘Mumbles ’ u2009” Teachers tended to ignore those not at the top of the class  That indifference stayed with him  and once he was mayor  Mr  Menino insisted on handing out awards to more than just the students who fared best on tests  though he conceded that his early parochial school education had at least one advantage  “I had 12 years of nuns who used to use their sticks on me ” he told the Globe in 1993  “If they did that today  you’d have more court cases  but it was good discipline ”In his memoir  Mr  Menino wrote that Harry Truman was his “political hero  I hung his portrait behind my desk at City Hall  A plain spoken man of the people ” Through David McCullough’s biography  a favorite book of the mayor’s  he learned that the former president “was also a scholar of Greek and Roman history  The public library was his college ”The public itself was Mr  Menino’s university as he climbed from his Hyde Park neighborhood to City Hall through a series of jobs  meeting little success until he found a home  and key mentors  in politics  He cleaned furnaces in a factory  took hot dog orders at Simco’s on the Bridge in Mattapan from 3 p m  until 2 a m   and then was hired as an insurance salesman for Metropolitan Life  a job for which  by his own account  he was supremely unsuited  except perhaps for the always presentable suits he wore Mr  Menino wrote that he took his sartorial cues from his father  who on Sundays “wore only the best  down to his silk shorts and cashmere socks ” The mayor was a regular at Filene’s Basement  shopping there three or four times a week until the store closed  He once estimated that he owned about 400 ties  75 to 80 shirts  numerous suits  and several blazers  “I need every piece ” he said with a smile  nWorking for Metropolitan Life  meanwhile  meant he had a respectable job when he met Angela Faletra as they played tennis on adjoining courts in Hyde Park one day and her errant shots kept angling his way  Their first date was that night  “She was pretty  bright  funny  and compassionate ” he wrote  “A Roslindale girl  but you can’t have everything  I’ve often been asked if becoming acting mayor of Boston wasn’t the luckiest break of my life  No  I reply ”They married in 1966  a few years after that first meeting  Fiercely devoted to the man she called “my Tommy ” Angela Menino kept working throughout their marriage  long after their two children  Susan and Thomas Jr   were grown and she could have set aside her accounting job at John Hancock Financial Services  “Work gives me my own identity ” she told the Globe in 2004  “Angie is the real thing ” Mr  Menino added in the same interview  “She doesn’t have to work  She could have a driver  and somebody to clean the house  But she’ll never give it up ”As his emissary of sorts  she served on several boards while advocating for children and the elderly  women  and the homeless  and she helped keep Mr  Menino grounded in who he was and where he was from  “She watches out to make sure Tom Menino stays Tom Menino ” David A  Passafaro  the mayor’s former chief of staff  told the Globe in 2005 Not long before Angela met Mr  Menino  he found himself drawn to John F  Kennedy’s presidential campaign  “In 1960 you couldn’t live in Massachusetts and be Catholic and ignore politics ” he wrote in his memoir  Mr  Menino skipped a night school class to attend Kennedy’s election eve speech at Faneuil Hall  and he joined the adoring crowds chasing JFK’s limousine along cobblestone streets  “waving my arms like a madman while running for all I was worth ”“Tom Menino was an extraordinary leader and a wonderful friend ” said Victoria Reggie Kennedy  the widow of US Senator Edward M  Kennedy  “He and my husband Ted had a great relationship  built on mutual respect  trust and love of the City of Boston ”In the early 1960s  Mr  Menino met Joseph Timilty  who wanted to be a city councilor  Mr  Menino worked to help elect Timilty  who repaid the favor when the future mayor lost his job at Metropolitan Life while trying to organize a union  “He got me ‘on’ at the Boston Redevelopment Authority ” Mr  Menino wrote  Meanwhile  Mr  Menino remained a key part of the campaign apparatus as Timilty moved from the City Council to the state Senate  and then took on Kevin White in the mayoral contests of 1971  ’75  and ’79  “I was Joe’s ‘body man ’ u2009” Mr  Menino recalled  “I saw him the first thing in the morning and the last thing at night ”The political training proved invaluable as Mr  Menino found he had a gift for sweating the behind the scenes details of planning and executing campaign events  which he put to use while helping run Pennsylvania field operations for Jimmy Carter’s presidential campaigns in 1976 and ’80  “I was paid peanuts for my work ” he wrote of those early years  “I would have paid to do it ” As a Timilty operative  Mr  Menino also learned about the perils of patronage when “Kevin White fired me from the BRA ” Timilty intervened again  Using his influence as a state senator  he “got me a job on one of his committees ” Mr  Menino wrote Years later  when Mr  Menino was mayor  Timilty was convicted of conspiracy to commit fraud and sentenced to four months in federal prison  “The contrast in our fortunes was painful to me ” Mr  Menino wrote By becoming mayor  the protégé achieved what his mentor could never accomplish in the White era  Mr  Menino’s first step was the City Council  a goal that seemed implausible  “I was the shyest person in the neighborhood ” he told the Globe in 1993  just after becoming acting mayor  “I was very  very shy  When I decided to run for office people in the neighborhood couldn’t believe it ” He won that first election after the City Council expanded from all at large seats to a combination of at large and district seats  Announcing his candidacy while standing in the backyard of his childhood home on Hyde Park Avenue  he ran in the district covering Hyde Park and slices of other neighborhoods  Angela at his side  he campaigned “ u2009‘the Menino way ’ one door  one vote at a time ” and won handily On the City Council  he sought the chairmanship of the newly formed Ways and Means Committee and established a reputation as a workhorse  intimate with the details and reach of the powerful panel that controlled the city’s budget  Rarely did Mr  Menino consider stepping away from city politics  In 1986  he flirted with a run for Suffolk County sheriff  but decided against it   and in 1992  he announced a bid for the soon to be vacant 11th Congressional District seat  only to see it evaporate in redistricting During those years he also picked up a new  valuable mentor in Gerard Doherty  who had chaired the Democratic State Committee and was a longtime Kennedy campaign operative  It was Doherty who told Mr  Menino he needed a college degree if he wanted to be mayor  so he enrolled at the University of Massachusetts Boston at the same time his daughter  Susan  was at the Amherst campus Mr  Menino reached a key stepping stone to the mayor’s office when he wove together a coalition of moderate and conservative councilors to be elected City Council president at the beginning of 1993  defeating Maura Hennigan in a 7 6 vote on the first ballot  That set the stage for his ascension to acting mayor a few months later when Flynn left to be ambassador to the Vatican  “I had to be mayor to be elected mayor ” Mr  Menino wrote  “That was my strategy ”Once elected  he proceeded to shape the look and feel of Boston as perhaps no other mayor had in the past  His intimacy with the city ranged from obscure budget details to the placement of fire hydrants  so developers knew the success of high profile proposals for highly visible projects often hinged on pleasing Mr  Menino For example  when the late Edward Linde was chief executive of Boston Properties Inc   he wanted to construct a 36 story building next to the Prudential Tower  “Guys  flat roofs don’t make it ” Mr  Menino said as he looked at the architectural drawings  Linde and his architect tried again  bringing a set of miniature proposed roofs to City Hall and setting each one atop the model of their planned tower  Linde later recalled the mayor’s reaction to one that looked like a crown  “He said  ‘I think this one would be great ’ u2009” Today  111 Huntington Ave  is among the most recognizable buildings in the city’s skyline At different points  Mr  Menino found himself at odds with the city’s public sector unions  with contact negotiations sometimes becoming rancorous  deeply personal affairs  Noting that one Fire Department captain had published a letter to the editor in the Globe with the phrase “we die for you ” an exasperated Mr  Menino wrote in his memoir  “Give me a break  Try negotiating with a union whose members die for you ” Revitalizing South Boston’s seaport turned a faded industrial waterfront into a booming district with an art museum and high end restaurants  a sprawling venture that took most of his tenure to realize  Mr  Menino also helped guide significant projects to outlying areas  including a $500 million New Balance development in Brighton and a $115 million municipal services building in Roxbury’s Dudley Square “Mayor Menino oversaw both the physical transformation of the city skyline and the transformation of our workforce and economy to one that is a leader in today’s global economy ” said Paul Guzzi  president and CEO of the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce  “He leaves behind a world class city that is thriving and poised for continued success ”Chief executives of major cities often want to leave a defining development  For Kevin White  it was Quincy Market  Mr  Menino envisioned a 1 000 foot skyscraper in the Financial District  which he said would be “a stunning statement of our belief in Boston’s bright future ” It was never built  nOther challenges also proved vexing  Race remained a measure for success  or lack thereof  in the city’s schools  And while graduation rates increased incrementally  that was enough to draw praise  “This is a school system that has improved substantially ” Samuel Tyler  president of the Boston Municipal Research Bureau  said in 2013  “That’s not to say we solved all the problems by any means  There’s still a lot to be done with the achievement gaps among racial groups ”Mr  Menino was more successful presiding over what became known as the Boston Miracle  In his early years as mayor  police stepped up outreach to neighborhood groups and church leaders to try to quell gang violence  Homicides plummeted from 98 in 1993  when Mr  Menino became acting mayor  to 31 in 1999  Violent crime rose again  but not to the levels of the late 1980s and early 1990s  and by the end of his tenure the number of homicides dropped four consecutive years  to 40 in 2013  Several years ago  he also joined with Mayor Michael Bloomberg of New York to cochair Mayors Against Illegal Guns  a nonprofit coalition that pushed for more gun controls “Whether it was tackling illegal guns or reviving neighborhoods  Tom was never afraid to take on tough issues ” Bloomberg said  “Tom was at his best when his city needed him most  In the aftermath of the Marathon bombing last year  he was steady as always  showing the same determined leadership that made his career in public service one of Boston’s most important and most influential ” As years passed  Mr  Menino consolidated power  becoming a strong political boss not to be crossed during his second decade in office  Still  programs that spoke to core beliefs forged early in his leadership remained in place  Finding summer work for youth — the initiative that helped lift his first mayoral bid — became an annual preoccupation as he tripled the number of participating private employers to 300  “He was obsessed with summer jobs with kids  because he saw that as a positive for the kids ” said Kevin Phelan  a commercial real estate executive and an ally of the mayor  “He’d lean on anybody and everybody that he knew to hire a kid or two or five or 25 for the summer  Every time you go to a meeting or a public event from January to May  it’s  ‘Well we’re up to 7 000 summer jobs  Last year we did 10 000  How’re we going to get another 3 000 ’ ”Funeral plans were not complete for Mr  Menino  whose survivors include his wife  Angela  his daughter  Susan Menino Fenton of Dorchester  his son  Thomas Jr  of Hyde Park  his brother  David of Hyde Park  his sister  Carolyn Phipps of Quincy  and six grandchildren “Tom Menino and I shared more than the title of being Mayor of Boston ” said his predecessor  Raymond Flynn  “Yes  we sometime disagreed about issues  but we never had a difference of opinion about our respect for each other and our pride in making Boston a great city ”Flynn added that “the day I left City Hall to become US ambassador to the Vatican  I said  ‘The City is in good hands ’ Today  Tom Menino is in good hands ”Last year  Harvard University awarded Mr  Menino an honorary doctorate  saying he had “shepherded the cradle of the American Revolution into the 21st century ”“I’m going to start wearing a bow tie pretty soon ” he joked to The New York Times “He was a strong and true friend of education  and he knew how much the pursuit of education and research means not only to Boston but to the larger world ” said Drew Faust  Harvard’s president  “All of us can learn from his powerful and humane example ” nIn his memoir  Mr  Menino settled a few scores  and he also listed many of his best known verbal gaffes  as if to defuse for the ages the running side narrative of his three decades in public office  reminding readers that he began his first mayoral speech in 1994 with the declaration  “I’m not a fancy talker ”More important to Mr  Menino were lists like the one detailing the way he dealt with gender inequity at City Hall  Along with appointing the first women as mayor’s chief of staff and campaign manager  “I appointed Boston’s first woman police commissioner  first woman corporation counsel  first woman director of the Boston Redevelopment Authority ” he wrote  City government gave its employees four hours off annually for cancer screening  and “when my public health commissioner told me how many African American women suffered from breast cancer  we fitted out a van to conduct mammograms and parked it in front of beauty parlors in minority neighborhoods  Thousands of women gained years of life from preventative care ”His own health suffered sporadically through the years  “I’d had a bout with a rare cancer ” he wrote in his memoir  adding a list of other maladies that included Crohn’s disease  high blood pressure  an infected elbow  a torn tendon in his right knee  and a blood clot

his elbows back as his son tipped the wheelchair forward  “Biting my lower lip against a twinge of pain  grabbing the lectern for balance  I stood up  The enclosed pulpit hid the line connecting my catheter to the bag on my wheelchair ”Once on his feet  in clear pain and in an international spotlight as he delivered the most closely watched speech of his career  Mr  Menino exhibited the

staff  t nBut the 48 year old entrepreneur has another story to tell  one that few have heard  The Boston native got a chance to reboot her life nearly two decades ago thanks to a Quincy shelter that gave her and her two small children a place to live “It was the best break I ever had ” Mendes said recently  “I was able to save money  reestablish my credit  and come to Newbury Street ”Mendes is now trying to help other struggling women to get the kind of support that she did  She is staging a gala show of hair styles  featuring several Newbury Street salons  and donating part of the proceeds to a daytime shelter in the Back Bay for poor and homeless women  The first Newbury Street Hair Show will be held Sunday at the Taj Hotel Boston  Mendes hopes the event raises as much as $10 000 for  “She is truly an American dream story  she really is ” said Cheryl McCallion  chief of anesthesiology at Signature Healthcare Brockton Hospital  a client and friend for more than a decade who drives from Dover to have her hair done by Mendes  “She wasn’t presented with a lot of opportunities yet she made it happen ”Mendes grew up in public housing developments in Roslindale and Dorchester  and was one of five siblings raised by a single mother  After graduation from Hyde Park High School  she landed a job in John Hancock Insurance’s billing office  She had two children she was raising alone  but still dreamed of opening a salon  Her mother  a housekeeper  advised against it — she told her daughter to get a job that didn’t require her to be on her feet all day But Mendes said she didn’t see a future at John Hancock  She also had trouble paying for rent and child care on a salary of less than $300 a week  so she found part time work washing hair at Vidal Sassoon’s Boston salon on Newbury Street It still wasn’t enough to cover her $1 100 rent and day care costs  She was close to eviction and moved into an emergency shelter run by Quincy Community Action Programs  a nonprofit that helps people in crisis  She qualified for one of the agency’s apartments and lived there rent free for about eight months  nKyle Martin  now Mendes’s husband  said he met her while she was living in Quincy  To the contractor who owned his own business  her long hours and sunny disposition left a big impression  She juggled her job at John Hancock with night classes at a Quincy beauty academy and the demands of two young children “She’d have to leave work  grab the kids  get them to a baby sitter  drop them off  go to school till 9 at night  and then pick them up ” Martin said  Then she would “start the day all over again ”After 12 years at John Hancock  Mendes quit when she got her stylist’s license  taking jobs at Newbury Street salons Mendes said she built a loyal clientele by following another stylist’s advice  avoid the personal dramas that can unfold with co workers and keep a steady stream of clients in your chair  Mendes’s reputation grew as an expert in installing hair extensions  a process that involves sewing expensive bands of human hair into horizontal braids tucked underneath a client’s natural hair The cost starts at $500 but can easily exceed thousands  depending on the size of the job  Mendes said she sometimes earned $6 000 or more a week  “It was a whole new world ” she said nShe saved and began to think about her own salon — down to the black and silver color scheme and the name  Salon Monet  after the artist  whose work she had once seen at the Museum of Fine Arts McCallion  her friend and client from Dover  recalled that Mendes initially considered renting less expensive space around the corner from Newbury Street  But McCallion told her  “If you get the salon around the corner  you’re always going to be Shellee’s salon around the corner from Newbury Street  Take the risk  Take the leap ” nSo Mendes did  funding the venture with savings and bank loans and opening 12 years ago  Her husband  who cosigned the loans  helped renovate the interior  which has black velvet drapes and light walls  framed in silver and black A diverse clientele with diverse hair types visits the salon  On one recent afternoon  Mendes wove long  dark extensions into a client’s hair  her nails clicking along as she braided  then threaded the hair in place  nAnother client  Elizabeth Santos of Newton  a real estate agent  said she wanted her hair to look especially good for an important meeting  A client for more than a decade  the 38 year old’s thick mane of long  wavy hair was tamed by Mendes into a shiny cascade of curls  “It’s really hard to find someone who knows your hair ” Santos said  “She knows what she’s doing ” nMany Newbury Street salons have come and gone since Mendes opened her business  She credits her success to the ability to style and treat anyone’s hair expertly  whether a rock star or her own mother  who is a client  But she hasn’t forgotten where she came from  At Sunday’s hair show  one of Mendes’s models will wear a style inspired by her teenage years  involving a top of the head ponytail  wrapped in ribbon  culminating in a spray of loose hair from the top  It’s another statement that a woman who lived in public housing can make it in Boston’s toniest retail district “I love it and I’m not going anywhere ” Mendes said  “I’m standing my ground ”', '2014_901')",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

economy and shape the skyline and the very identity of the city he loved through an unprecedented five consecutive terms in City Hall  died Thursday  He was 71  nand was diagnosed with advanced cancer not long after leaving office at the beginning of this year “Visionaries don’t get things done ” he once said  crisply separating himself from politicians who gaze at distant horizons and imagine what might be  Leaving to others the lofty rhetoric of Boston as the Athens of America  he took a decidedly ground level view of the city on a hill  earning himself a nickname for his intense focus on the nuts and bolts of everyday life  the urban mechanic  t nAn old school politician whose own smarts owed more to the streets than the college classroom  he nonetheless helped turn Boston into a hub of 21st century innovation  recruiting high tech companies to the sprawling South Boston waterfront one minute  then cutting the ribbon at a neighborhood burrito shop the next  A few weeks into his summer tenure as acting mayor in 1993  when some pundits fancied him a temporary caretaker  he offered a seemingly modest ambition  “I want to help people  help one individual a day  Just to make their life a little bit better ”His landslide election that fall to a first full term inaugurated a 20 year run as mayor  Deftly managing the city’s finances  Mr  Menino guided Boston’s commercial growth through roller coaster peaks and dips in the national economy  largely allowing the city to avoid the massive budget cuts that plagued other urban centers in the throes of the 2008 2009 downturn Throughout his years as mayor  development accelerated as the city added millions of square feet of new buildings  Wielding the power of his office  Mr  Menino could make development deals flourish — or shatter them just as swiftly  Known for his micromanaging  which at times drew criticism  he once intervened to personally approve the design of a Back Bay tower’s crown like peak For constituents  Mr  Menino was the perennial mayor in their midst  a constant presence at neighborhood events  More than half of the Bostonians who responded to a 2008 Globe poll said they had met him personally  Anyone who watched the mayor stroll through neighborhoods from Bowdoin Geneva to West Roxbury might think that figure far too low Mr  Menino’s health had declined in recent years  and he was hospitalized with a broken leg three days before the bombings occurred at the 2013 Boston Marathon  Checking himself out against his doctor’s advice  he attended the first news conference and three days later pushed himself out of his wheelchair to stand at the pulpit and speak at an interfaith service  “We are one Boston ” he said that day  “No adversity  no challenge  nothing can tear down the resilience in the heart of this city and its people ”A politician with a flashing temper  whose skin could be as thin as his victory margins were thick  Mr  Menino was Boston’s first mayor of Italian descent  After that first landslide in 1993  his reelection margins never dropped below 15 percentage points and were as high as 49 points  His time in office also straddled a significant demographic shift when the number of white residents in the city fell below 50 percent  and as Boston changed  he built a vaunted Democratic political machine  A protégé of Joseph Timilty  a former city councilor and state senator  Mr  Menino landed his first government jobs with his mentor’s assistance and knew firsthand how to use patronage Reaching beyond his solid base  Mr  Menino courted disparate constituencies that other candidates ignored or paid too little heed  such as African Americans  gays and lesbians  and conservatives in East Boston “If  100 years from now  they look back at my election  I hope what they see is the beginning of a century of inclusive politics ” Mr  Menino said in January 1994 at Faneuil Hall as part of his first State of the City address  “Throughout my whole career I have tried to be an open door to people left out of the mainstream  As mayor  I intend to continue that ”Robert E  Travaglini  a former state Senate president who served with Mr  Menino on the City Council  said that “Tommy Menino always followed his instincts and did what his heart and his head told him to do  For years  people were overlooked and underserved  He focused on those portions of the population  and he championed their causes  and they responded ”Stung as a boy by disparaging treatment from teachers dismissive of his Italian American heritage  Mr  Menino stressed in his first mayoral campaign that he would “not tolerate racism  I will never tolerate people being discriminated against ” He opposed bias of any kind  and few gestures were as potent as his decision early on to march in the city’s gay pride parade  while shunning South Boston’s traditional St  Patrick’s Day parade because it banned groups advocating for lesbian and gay rights  Years later  when the state began permitting same sex marriages on May 17  2004  Mr  Menino was waiting at City Hall to greet Julie and Hillary Goodridge  who were first in line  As lead plaintiffs  they had lent their name to the state Supreme Judicial Court case that legalized gay marriage six months earlier  n“Tom Menino personally experienced the injustice of prejudice ” Travaglini said  “He watched it with his family  with his parents and his grandparents  He experienced it politically  And it had a lasting impression ”Mr  Menino was City Council president when President Bill Clinton appointed Mayor Raymond L  Flynn ambassador to the Vatican  “Go out and get some new suits  you’re going to be acting mayor ” he recalled Flynn telling him when the ambassador discussions were afoot  On July 19  1993  Mr  Menino was sitting in his council office when an aide appeared at 4 20 p m  to say Flynn had formally resigned  The council president automatically succeeds a mayor who departs in the middle of a term  That night  Mr  Menino and his wife  Angela  danced at a Hyde Park block party to “My Way ” a favorite tune that became a de facto theme song — played again as the Meninos walked into Faneuil Hall on March 28  2013  when he announced he would not seek a sixth term “For 20 years  Boston has been lucky to have Tom Menino in the mayor’s office ” the Globe’s editorial board wrote the next day  “The city has improved in almost every respect  Menino wasn’t personally responsible for every positive development — many cities enjoyed the benefits of lower crime rates and a return to urban living — but he guided the changes with impressive political skills and finesse ”Nearly two decades earlier  after Mr  Menino was elected Boston’s 53d mayor on Nov  2  1993  Clinton called with congratulations  “Thank you  Mr  President  for making the mayor ambassador ” Mr  Menino said Plain spoken sentiments were a trademark of Mr  Menino  who often was famously tongue tied and prone to malapropisms  His swallowed words may have inspired the painful “Mumbles” nickname he wished would fade  but voters didn’t seem to mind  perhaps sensing in his labored language the wisdom of a common man who had done uncommonly well “Like people who give great speeches are great public officials  I mean  just look at the officials who give great speeches — they haven’t done a thing in their career  but they just look good or sound good ” Mr  Menino told the Globe in July 1993  “I’d like to see what they’ve done in their careers  What’s their record  Who have they helped ”While serving as acting mayor  he noted that a neighborhood newspaper headline had called him “Action mayor Tom Menino ” and said that if elected he would try to live up to the typo  Before facing voters that fall  he froze water rates  worked to bolster the city’s community policing effort  earmarked $1 million for housing for the elderly  and set aside $500 000 to fund summer jobs for youth  that last item a policy initiative to which he returned year after year  “It was the beginning of something big ” he later recalled He handily defeated state Representative James T  Brett in November  ending a run of Irish American mayors that stretched back decades  Mr  Menino received 64 4 percent of the vote to Brett’s 35 6 percent  one of Boston’s largest mayoral victories in the latter part of the 20th century  Though hard fought  the campaign was largely amicable  and even after the candidates preserved a strong relationship As he easily was reelected four times  Mr  Menino kept up a punishing pace  rising early to crisscross the city  Kevin H  White  the four term mayor who preceded Flynn  pioneered little city halls in outer neighborhoods  At times  Mr  Menino seemed to embody them  White and Flynn both yearned for the national stature of higher offices  For Mr  Menino  being mayor was a calling of the highest order On that November 1993 morning after he was first elected  the difference from the day before was apparent  “When you’re acting mayor  some people return your phone calls ” Mr  Menino said  “When you’re mayor  everyone returns your phone calls ”And everyone around him quickly learned that no cog in the vast machinery of city government was too small to escape his attention  En route to the office each day he called subordinates to report on what needed fixing or sprucing up  a pothole here  a broken streetlight there  an abandoned car that needed towing  a neighborhood park in need of mowing  Except for his ever present finely tailored suits  Mr  Menino was more workhorse than showhorse  earning his “urban mechanic” nickname neighborhood by neighborhood  street by street “I didn’t learn anything sitting in this room ” Mr  Menino told the Globe in July 2013  in his fifth floor City Hall office  “I’d rather be out there  talking to the people  This job  my legacy  is about the people ”For two decades  until his final December  Mr  Menino spent Christmas Eve touring the streets of the Bowdoin Geneva neighborhood  initially on foot and later by SUV when his health declined  “I’ll never say goodbye ” he said last December as he met once more with people  pastors  and business owners in a neighborhood that has seen more than its share of violence  gangs  and drugs  “I’ll be back here next year  the year after  and the year after  Not as mayor  but as a person who cares about what’s going on in the neighborhood ”Some criticized his unstinting devotion to minutiae  saying it diverted him from larger issues  In 1996  for example  Mr  Menino said voters should “judge me harshly” if he failed to improve the education system  Graduation rates remained comparatively flat through much of his tenure  only rising in recent years  and city schools also experienced persistent racial achievement gaps  Still  he appointed two longstanding Boston Public Schools superintendents  providing much needed stability for a school system that was shaken by the busing crisis and an extended period of short term superintendents  Beginning in 1995  Thomas Payzant served nearly 11 years  Carol Johnson was in the job six years until retiring last year No stranger to the academic challenges children face  Mr  Menino was a C student at St  Thomas Aquinas High School in Jamaica Plain and resisted his father’s insistence that he pursue higher education  “When I’d get after him to go to college  he’d say  ‘Truman never went to college ’ u2009” Mr  Menino’s father  Carl  who died in 1989  said in a 1983 WGBH TV documentary  adding  “He told me that a thousand times ”Only after being elected to the City Council in 1983 did Mr  Menino take to heart a mentor’s advice that he needed a college education if he wanted to advance  He graduated at 45  through a program that gave him a chunk of credits for serving as a city councilor  By that measure  when a bachelor’s degree at last arrived  he essentially had majored in being Tom Menino Though not averse to being addressed “mayor ” he remained a man of his neighborhood  often leaving phone messages identifying himself simply as Tom or Tommy  In his memoir “Mayor for a New America ” which was written with Jack Beatty and released Oct  14  he wrote about his beginnings in Hyde Park  the southernmost section of Boston that most politicians considered “the sticks ”Born Dec  27  1942  he was the oldest of three children  Mr  Menino’s father was part of the machinists union and worked 35 years at a Westinghouse plant  where he helped the future mayor land a summer job during high school  “By then my dad was a foreman ” Mr  Menino wrote  “I noticed how he heard the men out  It was his way of showing respect  That was my first lesson in politics ”Mr  Menino’s mother  Susan  “was a Mother Teresa to new immigrants in Hyde Park ” he wrote  The Meninos lived on the first floor of a two family house on Hyde Park Avenue and his paternal grandparents  immigrants from a village in southern Italy  lived upstairs The family owned an apartment building next door  where new immigrants cycled through every few years until they saved enough for a place of their own  Fluent in Italian  Mr  Menino’s mother helped them with bills  schools  and job applications  “every stage of their journey to America ”“I was 21 when she died with my 6 year old brother  David  in her arms ” he said  adding that his father’s grief “was total  like his love ” He wrote that his mother “was the strongest influence on my life ” inspiring his compassion for Boston’s newcomers and those struggling to succeed Mr  Menino noted in his memoir that he faced his own struggles at school  where “because my teeth and lips would not cooperate  I talked out of the side of my mouth  mumbling decades before I was called ‘Mumbles ’ u2009” Teachers tended to ignore those not at the top of the class  That indifference stayed with him  and once he was mayor  Mr  Menino insisted on handing out awards to more than just the students who fared best on tests  though he conceded that his early parochial school education had at least one advantage  “I had 12 years of nuns who used to use their sticks on me ” he told the Globe in 1993  “If they did that today  you’d have more court cases  but it was good discipline ”In his memoir  Mr  Menino wrote that Harry Truman was his “political hero  I hung his portrait behind my desk at City Hall  A plain spoken man of the people ” Through David McCullough’s biography  a favorite book of the mayor’s  he learned that the former president “was also a scholar of Greek and Roman history  The public library was his college ”The public itself was Mr  Menino’s university as he climbed from his Hyde Park neighborhood to City Hall through a series of jobs  meeting little success until he found a home  and key mentors  in politics  He cleaned furnaces in a factory  took hot dog orders at Simco’s on the Bridge in Mattapan from 3 p m  until 2 a m   and then was hired as an insurance salesman for Metropolitan Life  a job for which  by his own account  he was supremely unsuited  expect perhaps for the always presentable suits he wore Mr  Menino wrote that he took his sartorial cues from his father  who on Sundays “wore only the best  down to his silk shorts and cashmere socks ” The mayor was a regular at Filene’s Basement  shopping there three or four times a week until the store closed  He once estimated that he owned about 400 ties  75 to 80 shirts  numerous suits  and several blazers  “I need every piece ” he said with a smile Working for Metropolitan Life  meanwhile  meant he had a respectable job when he met Angela Faletra as they played tennis on adjoining courts in Hyde Park one day and her errant shots kept angling his way  Their first date was that night  “She was pretty  bright  funny  and compassionate ” he wrote  “A Roslindale girl  but you can’t have everything  I’ve often been asked if becoming acting mayor of Boston wasn’t the luckiest break of my life  No  I reply ”They married in 1966  a few years after that first meeting  Fiercely devoted to the man she called “my Tommy ” Angela Menino kept working throughout their marriage  long after their two children  Susan and Thomas Jr   were grown and she could have set aside her accounting job at John Hancock Financial Services  “Work gives me my own identity ” she told the Globe in 2004  “Angie is the real thing ” Mr  Menino added in the same interview  “She doesn’t have to work  She could have a driver  and somebody to clean the house  But she’ll never give it up ”As his emissary of sorts  she served on several boards while advocating for children and the elderly  women  and the homeless  and she helped keep Mr  Menino grounded in who he was and where he was from  “She watches out to make sure Tom Menino stays Tom Menino ” David A  Passafaro  the mayor’s former chief of staff  told the Globe in 2005 Not long before Angela met Mr  Menino  he found himself drawn to John F  Kennedy’s presidential campaign  “In 1960 you couldn’t live in Massachusetts and be Catholic and ignore politics ” he wrote in his memoir  Mr  Menino skipped a night school class to attend Kennedy’s election eve speech at Faneuil Hall  and he joined the adoring crowds chasing JFK’s limousine along cobblestone streets  “waving my arms like a madman while running for all I was worth ”In the early 1960s  he met Joseph Timilty  who wanted to be a city councilor  Mr  Menino worked to help elect Timilty  who repaid the favor when the future mayor lost his job at Metropolitan Life while trying to organize a union  “He got me ‘on’ at the Boston Redevelopment Authority ” Mr  Menino wrote  Meanwhile  Mr  Menino remained a key part of the campaign apparatus as Timilty moved from the City Council to the state Senate  and then took on Kevin White in the mayoral contests of 1971  ’75  and ’79  “I was Joe’s ‘body man ’ u2009” Mr  Menino recalled  “I saw him the first thing in the morning and the last thing at night ”The political training proved invaluable as Mr  Menino found he had a gift for sweating the behind the scenes details of planning and executing campaign events  which he put to use while helping run Pennsylvania field operations for Jimmy Carter’s presidential campaigns in 1976 and ’80  “I was paid peanuts for my work ” he wrote of those early years  “I would have paid to do it ” As a Timilty operative  Mr  Menino also learned about the perils of patronage when “Kevin White fired me from the BRA ” Timilty intervened again  Using his influence as a state senator  he “got me a job on one of his committees ” Mr  Menino wrote Years later  when Mr  Menino was mayor  Timilty was convicted of conspiracy to commit fraud and sentenced to four months in federal prison  “The contrast in our fortunes was painful to me ” Mr  Menino wrote By becoming mayor  the protégé achieved what his mentor could never accomplish in the White era  Mr  Menino’s first step was the City Council  a goal that seemed implausible  “I was the shyest person in the neighborhood ” he told the Globe in 1993  just after becoming acting mayor  “I was very  very shy  When I decided to run for office people in the neighborhood couldn’t believe it ” He won that first election after the City Council expanded from all at large seats to a combination of at large and district seats  Announcing his candidacy while standing in the backyard of his childhood home on Hyde Park Avenue  he ran in the district covering Hyde Park and slices of other neighborhoods  Angela at his side  he campaigned “ u2009‘the Menino way ’ one door  one vote at a time ” and won handily On the City Council  he sought the chairmanship of the newly formed Ways and Means Committee and established a reputation as a workhorse  intimate with the details and reach of the powerful panel that controlled the city’s budget  Rarely did Mr  Menino consider stepping away from city politics  In 1986  he flirted with a run for Suffolk County sheriff  but decided against it   and in 1992  he announced a bid for the soon to be vacant 11th Congressional District seat  only to see it evaporate in redistricting During those years he also picked up a new  valuable mentor in Gerard Doherty  who had chaired the Democratic State Committee and was a longtime Kennedy campaign operative  It was Doherty who told Mr  Menino he needed a college degree if he wanted to be mayor  so he enrolled at the University of Massachusetts Boston at the same time his daughter  Susan  was at the Amherst campus Mr  Menino reached a key stepping stone to the mayor’s office when he wove together a coalition of moderate and conservative councilors to be elected City Council president at the beginning of 1993  defeating Maura Hennigan in a 7 6 vote on the first ballot  That set the stage for his ascension to acting mayor a few months later when Flynn left to be ambassador to the Vatican  “I had to be mayor to be elected mayor ” Mr  Menino wrote  “That was my strategy ”Once elected  he proceeded to shape the look and feel of Boston as perhaps no other mayor had in the past  His intimacy with the city ranged from obscure budget details to the placement of fire hydrants  so developers knew the success of high profile proposals for highly visible projects often hinged on pleasing Mr  Menino For example  when the late Edward Linde was chief executive of Boston Properties Inc   he wanted to construct a 36 story building next to the Prudential Tower  “Guys  flat roofs don’t make it ” Mr  Menino said as he looked at the architectural drawings  Linde and his architect tried again  bringing a set of miniature proposed roofs to City Hall and setting each one atop the model of their planned tower  Linde later recalled the mayor’s reaction to one that looked like a crown  “He said  ‘I think this one would be great ’ u2009” Today  111 Huntington Ave  is among the most recognizable buildings in the city’s skyline At different points  Mr  Menino found himself at odds with the city’s public sector unions  with contact negotiations sometimes becoming rancorous  deeply personal affairs  Noting that one Fire Department captain had published a letter to the editor in the Globe with the phrase “we die for you ” an exasperated Mr  Menino wrote in his memoir  “Give me a break  Try negotiating with a union whose members die for you ” Revitalizing South Boston’s seaport turned a faded industrial waterfront into a booming district with an art museum and high end restaurants  a sprawling venture that took most of his tenure to realize  Mr  Menino also helped guide significant projects to outlying areas  including a $500 million New Balance development in Brighton and a $115 million municipal services building in Roxbury’s Dudley Square “One looks at the seaport area  which really was just called the South Boston harborside  and with his focus and desire  you had a major change ” said Boston real estate magnate Robert Beal  “It sat for many years as dead space ”Chief executives of major cities often want to leave a defining development  For Kevin White  it was Quincy Market  Mr  Menino envisioned a 1 000 foot skyscraper in the Financial District  which he said would be “a stunning statement of our belief in Boston’s bright future ” It was never built Other challenges also proved vexing  Race remained a measure for success  or lack thereof  in the city’s schools  And while graduation rates increased incrementally  that was enough to draw praise  “This is a school system that has improved substantially ” Samuel Tyler  president of the Boston Municipal Research Bureau  said in 2013  “That’s not to say we solved all the problems by any means  There’s still a lot to be done with the achievement gaps among racial groups ”Mr  Menino was more successful presiding over what became known as the Boston Miracle  In his early years as mayor  police stepped up outreach to neighborhood groups and church leaders to try to quell gang violence  Homicides plummeted from 98 in 1993  when Mr  Menino became acting mayor  to 31 in 1999  Violent crime rose again  but not to the levels of the late 1980s and early 1990s  and by the end of his tenure the number of homicides dropped four consecutive years  to 40 in 2013  Several years ago  he also joined with Mayor Michael Bloomberg of New York to cochair Mayors Against Illegal Guns  a nonprofit coalition of mayors that pushed for more gun controls  n“A vibrant new Boston  replete with a fast growing downtown and cleaner  safer neighborhoods  is part of Menino’s legacy ” the Globe’s editorial board pronounced  the day after he said he wouldn’t run a sixth time As years passed  Mr  Menino consolidated power  becoming a strong political boss not to be crossed during his second decade in office  Still  programs that spoke to core beliefs forged early in his leadership remained in place  Finding summer work for youth — the initiative that helped lift his first mayoral bid — became an annual preoccupation as he tripled the number of participating private employers to 300  “He was obsessed with summer jobs with kids  because he saw that as a positive for the kids ” said Kevin Phelan  a commercial real estate executive and an ally of the mayor  “He’d lean on anybody and everybody that he knew to hire a kid or two or five or 25 for the summer  Every time you go to a meeting or a public event from January to May  it’s  ‘Well we’re up to 7 000 summer jobs  Last year we did 10 000  How’re we going to get another 3 000 ’ ”Funeral plans were not complete for Mr  Menino  whose survivors include his wife  Angela  his daughter  Susan  and his son  Thomas Jr Last year  Harvard University awarded Mr  Menino an honorary doctorate  saying he had “shepherded the cradle of the American Revolution into the 21st century ”“I’m going to start wearing a bow tie pretty soon ” he joked to The New York Times That was never likely  “There is nothing phony about Tom Menino ” former Red Sox manager Joe Morgan  a longtime friend  said in 1993  “What you see is what you get ”In his memoir  Mr  Menino settled a few scores  and he also listed many of his best known verbal gaffes  as if to defuse for the ages the running side narrative of his three decades in public office  reminding readers that he began his first mayoral speech in 1994 with the declaration  “I’m not a fancy talker ”More important to Mr  Menino were lists like the one detailing the way he dealt with gender inequity at City Hall  Along with appointing the first women as mayor’s chief of staff and campaign manager  “I appointed Boston’s first woman police commissioner  first woman corporation counsel  first woman director of the Boston Redevelopment Authority ” he wrote  City government gave its employees four hours off annually for cancer screening  and “when my public health commissioner told me how many African American women suffered from breast cancer  we fitted out a van to conduct mammograms and parked it in front of beauty parlors in minority neighborhoods  Thousands of women gained years of life from preventative care ”His own health suffered sporadically through the years  “I’d had a bout with a rare cancer ” he wrote in his memoir  adding a list of other maladies that included Crohn’s disease  high blood pressure  an infected elbow  a torn tendon in his right knee  and a blood clot  Not even a broken leg could keep him in his wheelchair  however  when it was time to pay tribute at the interfaith service to those killed and injured in the Boston Marathon bombings “If you watched the service  you saw the struggle I had ” he wrote about the effort it took to stand at the pulpit  His blunt description of his frailty was characteristically unsparing  Mr  Menino recalled tucking his elbows back as his son tipped the wheelchair forward  “Biting my lower lip against a twinge of pain  grabbing the lectern for balance  I stood up  The enclosed pulpit hid the line connecting my catheter to the bag on my wheelchair ”Once on his feet  in clear pain and in an international spotlight as he delivered the most closely watched speech of his career  Mr  Menino exhibited the resilience he praised in the city he loved “This is Boston ” the mayor said  “a city with the courage  compassion  and strength that knows no bounds ”', '2014_354')",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the man they knew and loved as mayor for two decades  lining the streets of Boston for the funeral procession of Thomas M  Menino The hand scrawled signs along the route said it all  In the shadow of the Green Monster  on Lansdowne Street  “Thank You For Saving Fenway Park ” In once blighted Dudley Square  where construction workers paused  “Getting the job done ” On Columbia Road  in the Italian of Menino’s ancestors  “Riposare in Pace ” In front of the Mall of Roxbury  in Boston vernacular  held by a City Year volunteer  “Best maya eva   ” t nAnd at the edge of a crosswalk in Roslindale Village  where small children waved flags and the crowd pressed six deep  a sign said simply  “You Were Everybody’s Guy ”For 90 minutes and 19 miles  Menino’s casket wound through the city he cherished in a gleaming Cadillac hearse  trailing a vintage Packard laden with flowers that spelled BOSTON and leading a line of limousines and police motorcycles All along the way  the faces and clothing reflected the diversity that Menino embraced  a mayor for all in a city so long riven by racial and ethnic divides  split by class or age or neighborhood lines  Black and white  Latino and Asian  men in yarmulkes  hard hats  scally caps  and headphones  women in earmuffs  knit caps  head scarves  overcoats  even bathrobes  and scores of children  packing the sidewalks and the steps of every school the procession passed Some people waited for hours  others rushed out in flip flops  Many removed their hats  clutched a hand to their hearts  or saluted  thousands did so even while taking pictures or video with their other hand  “God bless you ” they called  from the front steps of town houses and the back stairs of bodegas  “We love you ”They included Anna Adler and Kerri Schmidt of ReadBoston  a literacy program Menino founded in 1995  who joined the crowd outside the Parkman House  the official Beacon Hill manse that the mayor used for high profile occasions while still living in the modest Hyde Park single family he shared with wife  Angela  “I mean  we loved him ” Schmidt said  her voice breaking  “It’s pretty simple ”The procession  which Menino’s aides called his “last ride home ” passed by 10 locations of particular meaning to Menino during his three decades as city councilor and mayor and 71 years as a Bostonian  starting at Faneuil Hall — where he delivered his first inaugural and so many State of the City addresses — and ending at Hyde Park’s Most Precious Blood Church  where the young Menino served as altar boy By 10 a m   a crowd had gathered on the steps of Quincy Market and pressed up against temporary barricades opposite Faneuil Hall  where Menino’s body had lain in state for the previous 24 hours  On a chilly fall morning  they shifted in place and clutched coffee cups as well as the green and white “Thank You Mayor Menino” signs that were handed out there and at a dozen other locations along the route Just after 10 20  former president Bill Clinton arrived  walking across the cobblestones to greet Menino’s children at the entrance  resting his left hand on Thomas Jr ’s shoulder while shaking hands with Susan with his right  He joined the family inside for a final prayer With bagpipers skirling and Special Operations officers standing at attention  the Meninos and Clinton reappeared 20 minutes later  the former president hugging them as he helped Susan and Angela into the lead limousine  While Clinton and Thomas Jr   a Boston police detective  stood silently nearby  longtime Menino spokeswoman Dot Joyce emerged from Faneuil Hall  carrying toward the limo the baseball bat cane that had rested beside Menino in an open casket Then Menino’s casket appeared  draped in the city’s powder blue flag and carried to the hearse by nine Special Operations officers in brilliant blue helmets  beginning the procession a little before 11 a m  There and everywhere  the people who stood at attention included so many who had met him at neighborhood events and ribbon cuttings  a man who took care of potholes and knew his way around a block party On Quincy Market’s granite steps  Janet Black of Charlestown could not help but smile as she remembered ribbing the mayor when she saw him reach for a bag of potato chips at a Knights of Columbus Hall  after he claimed to be on a diet  “Mr  Mayor  what would your wife say ” the 71 year old crossing guard said she asked him  He grinned  abandoned the chips  and chose a tuna fish sandwich The procession banked past City Hall  and headed for Tremont Street  where a reenactor in Colonial garb waved from the Granary Burying Ground  and the tour in her charge did the same  At the corner of Park Street  a grandmother pushing a stroller gasped  “Oh  God bless ” she said On Beacon Hill  Michael Ratty said he felt “sheer pain” as the procession passed  “It seems impossible to talk about him in the past tense ” said Ratty  a 35 year old who volunteered for Menino’s final campaign  “He was just omnipresent ”Further down Beacon Street  a postal worker paused between cars in the Back Bay  clasping her hands together  In Kenmore Square  where Menino took a Boston University teaching post and helped launch the Initiative on Cities think tank after leaving City Hall  a young man held a “Thank You Prof  Menino” sign Outside 102 year old Fenway Park  which Menino is credited with helping to save  people clutched Sox caps to their hearts on Yawkey Way  beneath the three World Series banners the team won during a mayoral reign rich in championships  Past

hundreds of affordable homes  three new schools  a sparkling police station  a thriving community center  and the transformation of the abandoned Ferdinand Building furniture store into an elegant headquarters for the Boston Public Schools — a woman in a purple knit hat cried in front of the bus depot and extended her arms  nIn Grove Hall  people leaned on car horns in the parking lot of the shopping center that Menino pushed to bring to the area  and the crowd erupted  “TM  we love you ” Nancy Smith called out  Tears came to her eyes as she waved at the family in the motorcade  and saw that Menino — as he so often did in life — had remembered in death the neighborhoods of Roxbury and Dorchester “At the end  he wanted us to know it wasn’t a sham game ” she said  “It was the real deal ”The procession skirted Franklin Park  where the English High JROTC held a banner  wove through the Bowdoin Geneva neighborhood  where the Walgreens sign lighted up to read “Farewell Mayor Menino   We Will Miss You ” and headed toward Blue Hill Avenue and Mattapan  passing a man who paused atop scaffolding and saluted with a paint brush And on it went  through Roslindale Square and down Washington

economy and shape the skyline and the very identity of the city he loved through an unprecedented five consecutive terms in City Hall  died Thursday  He was 71 and was diagnosed with advanced cancer not long after leaving office at the beginning of this year “Visionaries don’t get things done ” he once said  crisply separating himself from politicians who gaze at distant horizons and imagine what might be  Leaving to others the lofty rhetoric of Boston as the Athens of America  he took a decidedly ground level view of the city on a hill  earning himself a nickname for his intense focus on the nuts and bolts of everyday life  the urban mechanic  t nAn old school politician whose own smarts owed more to the streets than the college classroom  Menino nonetheless helped turn Boston into a hub of 21st century innovation  recruiting high tech companies to the sprawling South Boston waterfront one minute  then cutting the ribbon at a neighborhood burrito shop the next  “No man possessed a greater love for our city  and his dedicated life in service to Boston and her people changed the face of the city ” said his successor  Mayor Martin J  Walsh  “With sheer determination and unmatched work ethic  he took a city that is not as big in size as we are in stature and put us on the world stage as a national leader in health care  education  innovation  and the nitty gritty of executing basic city services ”“Because of his leadership ” Walsh added  “Boston is a better place today ”Dot Joyce  Mr  Menino’s longtime spokeswoman  said in a statement that “just after 9 a m  this morning the Honorable Thomas M  Menino passed into eternal rest after a courageous battle with cancer  He was surrounded by his devoted wife  Angela  loving family and friends ” In a statement yesterday  President Obama said Mr  Menino was “bold  big hearted  and Boston strong ”“Tom was the embodiment of the city he loved and led for more than two decades ” Obama said  “As Boston’s longest serving mayor  Tom helped make his hometown the vibrant  welcoming  world class place it is today  His legacy lives on in every neighborhood he helped revitalize  every school he helped turn around  and every community he helped make a safer  better place to live ”A few weeks into Mr  Menino’s summer tenure as acting mayor in 1993  when some pundits fancied him a temporary caretaker  he offered a seemingly modest ambition  “I want to help people  help one individual a day  Just to make their life a little bit better ”His landslide election that fall to a first full term inaugurated a 20 year run as mayor  Deftly managing the city’s finances  Mr  Menino guided Boston’s commercial growth through roller coaster peaks and dips in the national economy  largely allowing the city to avoid the massive budget cuts that plagued other urban centers in the throes of the 2008 2009 downturn  nThroughout his years as mayor  development accelerated as the city added millions of square feet of new buildings  Wielding the power of his office  Mr  Menino could make development deals flourish — or shatter them just as swiftly  Known for his micromanaging  which at times drew criticism  he once intervened to personally approve the design of a Back Bay tower’s crown like peak For constituents  Mr  Menino was the perennial mayor in their midst  a constant presence at neighborhood events  More than half of the Bostonians who responded to a 2008 Globe poll said they had met him personally  Anyone who watched the mayor stroll through neighborhoods from Bowdoin Geneva to West Roxbury might think that figure far too low Mr  Menino’s health had declined in recent years  and he was hospitalized with a broken leg three days before the bombings occurred at the 2013 Boston Marathon  Checking himself out against his doctor’s advice  he attended the first news conference and three days later pushed himself out of his wheelchair to stand at the pulpit and speak at an interfaith service  “We are one Boston ” he said that day  “No adversity  no challenge  nothing can tear down the resilience in the heart of this city and its people ”A politician with a flashing temper  whose skin could be as thin as his victory margins were thick  Mr  Menino was Boston’s first mayor of Italian descent  After that first landslide in 1993  his reelection margins never dropped below 15 percentage points and were as high as 49 points  His time in office also straddled a significant demographic shift when the number of white residents in the city fell below 50 percent  and as Boston changed  he built a vaunted Democratic political machine  A protégé of Joseph Timilty  a former city councilor and state senator  Mr  Menino landed his first government jobs with his mentor’s assistance and knew firsthand how to use patronage Reaching beyond his solid base  Mr  Menino courted disparate constituencies that other candidates ignored or paid too little heed  such as African Americans  gays and lesbians  and conservatives in East Boston “If  100 years from now  they look back at my election  I hope what they see is the beginning of a century of inclusive politics ” Mr  Menino said in January 1994 at Faneuil Hall as part of his first State of the City address  “Throughout my whole career I have tried to be an open door to people left out of the mainstream  As mayor  I intend to continue that ”Robert E  Travaglini  a former state Senate president who served with Mr  Menino on the City Council  said that “Tommy Menino always followed his instincts and did what his heart and his head told him to do  For years  people were overlooked and underserved  He focused on those portions of the population  and he championed their causes  and they responded ”Stung as a boy by disparaging treatment from teachers dismissive of his Italian American heritage  Mr  Menino stressed in his first mayoral campaign that he would “not tolerate racism  I will never tolerate people being discriminated against ” He opposed bias of any kind  and few gestures were as potent as his decision early on to march in the city’s gay pride parade  while shunning South Boston’s traditional St  Patrick’s Day parade because it banned groups advocating for lesbian and gay rights  Years later  when the state began permitting same sex marriages on May 17  2004  Mr  Menino was waiting at City Hall to greet Julie and Hillary Goodridge  who were first in line  As lead plaintiffs  they had lent their name to the state Supreme Judicial Court case that legalized gay marriage six months earlier  n“Tom Menino personally experienced the injustice of prejudice ” Travaglini said  “He watched it with his family  with his parents and his grandparents  He experienced it politically  And it had a lasting impression  nUS Senator Edward J  Markey said that “in every neighborhood across this city  Boston will mourn today after losing this great mayor  but we will fill that void with the love and respect we have for the life and the legacy of Tom Menino  Boston loves Tom Menino because Tom Menino loved Boston with all of his heart ”Mr  Menino was City Council president when President Bill Clinton appointed Mayor Raymond L  Flynn ambassador to the Vatican  “Go out and get some new suits  you’re going to be acting mayor ” he recalled Flynn telling him when the ambassador discussions were afoot  On July 19  1993  Mr  Menino was sitting in his council office when an aide appeared at 4 20 p m  to say Flynn had formally resigned  The council president automatically succeeds a mayor who departs in the middle of a term  That night  Mr  Menino and his wife  Angela  danced at a Hyde Park block party to “My Way ” a favorite tune that became a de facto theme song — played again as the Meninos walked into Faneuil Hall on March 28  2013  when he announced he would not seek a sixth term “For 20 years  Boston has been lucky to have Tom Menino in the mayor’s office ” the Globe’s editorial board wrote the next day  “The city has improved in almost every respect  Menino wasn’t personally responsible for every positive development — many cities enjoyed the benefits of lower crime rates and a return to urban living — but he guided the changes with impressive political skills and finesse ”Nearly two decades earlier  after Mr  Menino was elected Boston’s 53d mayor on Nov  2  1993  Clinton called with congratulations  “Thank you  Mr  President  for making the mayor ambassador ” Mr  Menino said Plain spoken sentiments were a trademark of Mr  Menino  who often was famously tongue tied and prone to malapropisms  His swallowed words may have inspired the painful “Mumbles” nickname he wished would fade  but voters didn’t seem to mind  perhaps sensing in his labored language the wisdom of a common man who had done uncommonly well “Like people who give great speeches are great public officials  I mean  just look at the officials who give great speeches — they haven’t done a thing in their career  but they just look good or sound good ” Mr  Menino told the Globe in July 1993  “I’d like to see what they’ve done in their careers  What’s their record  Who have they helped ”While serving as acting mayor  he noted that a neighborhood newspaper headline had called him “Action mayor Tom Menino ” and said that if elected he would try to live up to the typo  Before facing voters that fall  he froze water rates  worked to bolster the city’s community policing effort  earmarked $1 million for housing for the elderly  and set aside $500 000 to fund summer jobs for youth  that last item a policy initiative to which he returned year after year  “It was the beginning of something big ” he later recalled  nHe handily defeated state Representative James T  Brett in November  ending a run of Irish American mayors that stretched back decades  Mr  Menino received 64 4 percent of the vote to Brett’s 35 6 percent  one of Boston’s largest mayoral victories in the latter part of the 20th century  Though hard fought  the campaign was largely amicable  and even after the candidates preserved a strong relationship As he easily was reelected four times  Mr  Menino kept up a punishing pace  rising early to crisscross the city  Kevin H  White  the four term mayor who preceded Flynn  pioneered little city halls in outer neighborhoods  At times  Mr  Menino seemed to embody them  White and Flynn both yearned for the national stature of higher offices  For Mr  Menino  being mayor was a calling of the highest order On that November 1993 morning after he was first elected  the difference from the day before was apparent  “When you’re acting mayor  some people return your phone calls ” Mr  Menino said  “When you’re mayor  everyone returns your phone calls ”And everyone around him quickly learned that no cog in the vast machinery of city government was too small to escape his attention  En route to the office each day he called subordinates to report on what needed fixing or sprucing up  a pothole here  a broken streetlight there  an abandoned car that needed towing  a neighborhood park in need of mowing  Except for his ever present finely tailored suits  Mr  Menino was more workhorse than showhorse  earning his “urban mechanic” nickname neighborhood by neighborhood  street by street “I didn’t learn anything sitting in this room ” Mr  Menino told the Globe in July 2013  in his fifth floor City Hall office  “I’d rather be out there  talking to the people  This job  my legacy  is about the people ”For two decades  until his final December  Mr  Menino spent Christmas Eve touring the streets of the Bowdoin Geneva neighborhood  initially on foot and later by SUV when his health declined  “I’ll never say goodbye ” he said last December as he met once more with people  pastors  and business owners in a neighborhood that has seen more than its share of violence  gangs  and drugs  “I’ll be back here next year  the year after  and the year after  Not as mayor  but as a person who cares about what’s going on in the neighborhood ”Cardinal Seán P  O’Malley said it was “a blessing for me to have known Tom and Angela since the time I arrived in Boston and to share in their faith and their good works  They always held providing support and assistance for people in need as a priority ”Some criticized Mr  Menino’s unstinting devotion to minutiae  saying it diverted him from larger issues  In 1996  for example  he said voters should “judge me harshly” if he failed to improve the education system  Graduation rates remained comparatively flat through much of his tenure  only rising in recent years  and city schools also experienced persistent racial achievement gaps  Still  he appointed two longstanding Boston Public Schools superintendents  providing much needed stability for a school system that was shaken by the busing crisis and an extended period of short term superintendents  Beginning in 1995  Thomas Payzant served nearly 11 years  Carol Johnson was in the job six years until retiring last year No stranger to the academic challenges children face  Mr  Menino was a C student at St  Thomas Aquinas High School in Jamaica Plain and resisted his father’s insistence that he pursue higher education  “When I’d get after him to go to college  he’d say  ‘Truman never went to college ’ u2009” Mr  Menino’s father  Carl  who died in 1989  said in a 1983 WGBH TV documentary  adding  “He told me that a thousand times ”Only after being elected to the City Council in 1983 did Mr  Menino take to heart a mentor’s advice that he needed a college education if he wanted to advance  He graduated at 45  through a program that gave him a chunk of credits for serving as a city councilor  By that measure  when a bachelor’s degree at last arrived  he essentially had majored in being Tom Menino Though not averse to being addressed “mayor ” he remained a man of his neighborhood  often leaving phone messages identifying himself simply as Tom or Tommy  In his memoir “Mayor for a New America ” which was written with Jack Beatty and released Oct  14  he wrote about his beginnings in Hyde Park  the southernmost section of Boston that most politicians considered “the sticks ”Born Dec  27  1942  he was the oldest of three children  Mr  Menino’s father was part of the machinists union and worked 35 years at a Westinghouse plant  where he helped the future mayor land a summer job during high school  “By then my dad was a foreman ” Mr  Menino wrote  “I noticed how he heard the men out  It was his way of showing respect  That was my first lesson in politics ”Mr  Menino’s mother  Susan  “was a Mother Teresa to new immigrants in Hyde Park ” he wrote  The Meninos lived on the first floor of a two family house on Hyde Park Avenue and his paternal grandparents  immigrants from a village in southern Italy  lived upstairs  nThe family owned an apartment building next door  where new immigrants cycled through every few years until they saved enough for a place of their own  Fluent in Italian  Mr  Menino’s mother helped them with bills  schools  and job applications  “every stage of their journey to America ”“I was 21 when she died with my 6 year old brother  David  in her arms ” he said  adding that his father’s grief “was total  like his love ” He wrote that his mother “was the strongest influence on my life ” inspiring his compassion for Boston’s newcomers and those struggling to succeed Mr  Menino noted in his memoir that he faced his own struggles at school  where “because my teeth and lips would not cooperate  I talked out of the side of my mouth  mumbling decades before I was called ‘Mumbles ’ u2009” Teachers tended to ignore those not at the top of the class  That indifference stayed with him  and once he was mayor  Mr  Menino insisted on handing out awards to more than just the students who fared best on tests  though he conceded that his early parochial school education had at least one advantage  “I had 12 years of nuns who used to use their sticks on me ” he told the Globe in 1993  “If they did that today  you’d have more court cases  but it was good discipline ”In his memoir  Mr  Menino wrote that Harry Truman was his “political hero  I hung his portrait behind my desk at City Hall  A plain spoken man of the people ” Through David McCullough’s biography  a favorite book of the mayor’s  he learned that the former president “was also a scholar of Greek and Roman history  The public library was his college ”The public itself was Mr  Menino’s university as he climbed from his Hyde Park neighborhood to City Hall through a series of jobs  meeting little success until he found a home  and key mentors  in politics  He cleaned furnaces in a factory  took hot dog orders at Simco’s on the Bridge in Mattapan from 3 p m  until 2 a m   and then was hired as an insurance salesman for Metropolitan Life  a job for which  by his own account  he was supremely unsuited  except perhaps for the always presentable suits he wore Mr  Menino wrote that he took his sartorial cues from his father  who on Sundays “wore only the best  down to his silk shorts and cashmere socks ” The mayor was a regular at Filene’s Basement  shopping there three or four times a week until the store closed  He once estimated that he owned about 400 ties  75 to 80 shirts  numerous suits  and several blazers  “I need every piece ” he said with a smile Working for Metropolitan Life  meanwhile  meant he had a respectable job when he met Angela Faletra as they played tennis on adjoining courts in Hyde Park one day and her errant shots kept angling his way  Their first date was that night  “She was pretty  bright  funny  and compassionate ” he wrote  “A Roslindale girl  but you can’t have everything  I’ve often been asked if becoming acting mayor of Boston wasn’t the luckiest break of my life  No  I reply ”They married in 1966  a few years after that first meeting  Fiercely devoted to the man she called “my Tommy ” Angela Menino kept working throughout their marriage  long after their two children  Susan and Thomas Jr   were grown and she could have set aside her accounting job at John Hancock Financial Services  “Work gives me my own identity ” she told the Globe in 2004  “Angie is the real thing ” Mr  Menino added in the same interview  “She doesn’t have to work  She could have a driver  and somebody to clean the house  But she’ll never give it up ”As his emissary of sorts  she served on several boards while advocating for children and the elderly  women  and the homeless  and she helped keep Mr  Menino grounded in who he was and where he was from  “She watches out to make sure Tom Menino stays Tom Menino ” David A  Passafaro  the mayor’s former chief of staff  told the Globe in 2005 Not long before Angela met Mr  Menino  he found himself drawn to John F  Kennedy’s presidential campaign  “In 1960 you couldn’t live in Massachusetts and be Catholic and ignore politics ” he wrote in his memoir  Mr  Menino skipped a night school class to attend Kennedy’s election eve speech at Faneuil Hall  and he joined the adoring crowds chasing JFK’s limousine along cobblestone streets  “waving my arms like a madman while running for all I was worth ”“Tom Menino was an extraordinary leader and a wonderful friend ” said Victoria Reggie Kennedy  the widow of US Senator Edward M  Kennedy  “He and my husband Ted had a great relationship  built on mutual respect  trust and love of the City of Boston ”In the early 1960s  Mr  Menino met Joseph Timilty  who wanted to be a city councilor  Mr  Menino worked to help elect Timilty  who repaid the favor when the future mayor lost his job at Metropolitan Life while trying to organize a union  “He got me ‘on’ at the Boston Redevelopment Authority ” Mr  Menino wrote  Meanwhile  Mr  Menino remained a key part of the campaign apparatus as Timilty moved from the City Council to the state Senate  and then took on Kevin White in the mayoral contests of 1971  ’75  and ’79  “I was Joe’s ‘body man ’ u2009” Mr  Menino recalled  “I saw him the first thing in the morning and the last thing at night ”The political training proved invaluable as Mr  Menino found he had a gift for sweating the behind the scenes details of planning and executing campaign events  which he put to use while helping run Pennsylvania field operations for Jimmy Carter’s presidential campaigns in 1976 and ’80  “I was paid peanuts for my work ” he wrote of those early years  “I would have paid to do it ” As a Timilty operative  Mr  Menino also learned about the perils of patronage when “Kevin White fired me from the BRA ” Timilty intervened again  Using his influence as a state senator  he “got me a job on one of his committees ” Mr  Menino wrote Years later  when Mr  Menino was mayor  Timilty was convicted of conspiracy to commit fraud and sentenced to four months in federal prison  “The contrast in our fortunes was painful to me ” Mr  Menino wrote By becoming mayor  the protégé achieved what his mentor could never accomplish in the White era  Mr  Menino’s first step was the City Council  a goal that seemed implausible  “I was the shyest person in the neighborhood ” he told the Globe in 1993  just after becoming acting mayor  “I was very  very shy  When I decided to run for office people in the neighborhood couldn’t believe it ” He won that first election after the City Council expanded from all at large seats to a combination of at large and district seats  Announcing his candidacy while standing in the backyard of his childhood home on Hyde Park Avenue  he ran in the district covering Hyde Park and slices of other neighborhoods  Angela at his side  he campaigned “ u2009‘the Menino way ’ one door  one vote at a time ” and won handily On the City Council  he sought the chairmanship of the newly formed Ways and Means Committee and established a reputation as a workhorse  intimate with the details and reach of the powerful panel that controlled the city’s budget  Rarely did Mr  Menino consider stepping away from city politics  In 1986  he flirted with a run for Suffolk County sheriff  but decided against it   and in 1992  he announced a bid for the soon to be vacant 11th Congressional District seat  only to see it evaporate in redistricting During those years he also picked up a new  valuable mentor in Gerard Doherty  who had chaired the Democratic State Committee and was a longtime Kennedy campaign operative  It was Doherty who told Mr  Menino he needed a college degree if he wanted to be mayor  so he enrolled at the University of Massachusetts Boston at the same time his daughter  Susan  was at the Amherst campus Mr  Menino reached a key stepping stone to the mayor’s office when he wove together a coalition of moderate and conservative councilors to be elected City Council president at the beginning of 1993  defeating Maura Hennigan in a 7 6 vote on the first ballot  That set the stage for his ascension to acting mayor a few months later when Flynn left to be ambassador to the Vatican  “I had to be mayor to be elected mayor ” Mr  Menino wrote  “That was my strategy ”Once elected  he proceeded to shape the look and feel of Boston as perhaps no other mayor had in the past  His intimacy with the city ranged from obscure budget details to the placement of fire hydrants  so developers knew the success of high profile proposals for highly visible projects often hinged on pleasing Mr  Menino For example  when the late Edward Linde was chief executive of Boston Properties Inc   he wanted to construct a 36 story building next to the Prudential Tower  “Guys  flat roofs don’t make it ” Mr  Menino said as he looked at the architectural drawings  Linde and his architect tried again  bringing a set of miniature proposed roofs to City Hall and setting each one atop the model of their planned tower  Linde later recalled the mayor’s reaction to one that looked like a crown  “He said  ‘I think this one would be great ’ u2009” Today  111 Huntington Ave  is among the most recognizable buildings in the city’s skyline At different points  Mr  Menino found himself at odds with the city’s public sector unions  with contact negotiations sometimes becoming rancorous  deeply personal affairs  Noting that one Fire Department captain had published a letter to the editor in the Globe with the phrase “we die for you ” an exasperated Mr  Menino wrote in his memoir  “Give me a break  Try negotiating with a union whose members die for you ” Revitalizing South Boston’s seaport turned a faded industrial waterfront into a booming district with an art museum and high end restaurants  a sprawling venture that took most of his tenure to realize  Mr  Menino also helped guide significant projects to outlying areas  including a $500 million New Balance development in Brighton and a $115 million municipal services building in Roxbury’s Dudley Square “Mayor Menino oversaw both the physical transformation of the city skyline and the transformation of our workforce and economy to one that is a leader in today’s global economy ” said Paul Guzzi  president and CEO of the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce  “He leaves behind a world class city that is thriving and poised for continued success ”Chief executives of major cities often want to leave a defining development  For Kevin White  it was Quincy Market  Mr  Menino envisioned a 1 000 foot skyscraper in the Financial District  which he said would be “a stunning statement of our belief in Boston’s bright future ” It was never built Other challenges also proved vexing  Race remained a measure for success  or lack thereof  in the city’s schools  And while graduation rates increased incrementally  that was enough to draw praise  “This is a school system that has improved substantially ” Samuel Tyler  president of the Boston Municipal Research Bureau  said in 2013  “That’s not to say we solved all the problems by any means  There’s still a lot to be done with the achievement gaps among racial groups ”Mr  Menino was more successful presiding over what became known as the Boston Miracle  In his early years as mayor  police stepped up outreach to neighborhood groups and church leaders to try to quell gang violence  Homicides plummeted from 98 in 1993  when Mr  Menino became acting mayor  to 31 in 1999  Violent crime rose again  but not to the levels of the late 1980s and early 1990s  and by the end of his tenure the number of homicides dropped four consecutive years  to 40 in 2013  Several years ago  he also joined with Mayor Michael Bloomberg of New York to cochair Mayors Against Illegal Guns  a nonprofit coalition that pushed for more gun controls “Whether it was tackling illegal guns or reviving neighborhoods  Tom was never afraid to take on tough issues ” Bloomberg said  “Tom was at his best when his city needed him most  In the aftermath of the Marathon bombing last year  he was steady as always  showing the same determined leadership that made his career in public service one of Boston’s most important and most influential ” As years passed  Mr  Menino consolidated power  becoming a strong political boss not to be crossed during his second decade in office  Still  programs that spoke to core beliefs forged early in his leadership remained in place  Finding summer work for youth — the initiative that helped lift his first mayoral bid — became an annual preoccupation as he tripled the number of participating private employers to 300  “He was obsessed with summer jobs with kids  because he saw that as a positive for the kids ” said Kevin Phelan  a commercial real estate executive and an ally of the mayor  “He’d lean on anybody and everybody that he knew to hire a kid or two or five or 25 for the summer  Every time you go to a meeting or a public event from January to May  it’s  ‘Well we’re up to 7 000 summer jobs  Last year we did 10 000  How’re we going to get another 3 000 ’ ”Funeral plans were not complete for Mr  Menino  whose survivors include his wife  Angela  his daughter  Susan Menino Fenton of Dorchester  his son  Thomas Jr  of Hyde Park  his brother  David of Hyde Park  his sister  Carolyn Phipps of Quincy  and six grandchildren “Tom Menino and I shared more than the title of being Mayor of Boston ” said his predecessor  Raymond Flynn  “Yes  we sometime disagreed about issues  but we never had a difference of opinion about our respect for each other and our pride in making Boston a great city ”Flynn added that “the day I left City Hall to become US ambassador to the Vatican  I said  ‘The City is in good hands ’ Today  Tom Menino is in good hands ”Last year  Harvard University awarded Mr  Menino an honorary doctorate  saying he had “shepherded the cradle of the American Revolution into the 21st century ”“I’m going to start wearing a bow tie pretty soon ” he joked to The New York Times “He was a strong and true friend of education  and he knew how much the pursuit of education and research means not only to Boston but to the larger world ” said Drew Faust  Harvard’s president  “All of us can learn from his powerful and humane example ” nIn his memoir  Mr  Menino settled a few scores  and he also listed many of his best known verbal gaffes  as if to defuse for the ages the running side narrative of his three decades in public office  reminding readers that he began his first mayoral speech in 1994 with the declaration  “I’m not a fancy talker ”More important to Mr  Menino were lists like the one detailing the way he dealt with gender inequity at City Hall  Along with appointing the first women as mayor’s chief of staff and campaign manager  “I appointed Boston’s first woman police commissioner  first woman corporation counsel  first woman director of the Boston Redevelopment Authority ” he wrote  City government gave its employees four hours off annually for cancer screening  and “when my public health commissioner told me how many African American women suffered from breast cancer  we fitted out a van to conduct mammograms and parked it in front of beauty parlors in minority neighborhoods  Thousands of women gained years of life from preventative care ”His own health suffered sporadically through the years  “I’d had a bout with a rare cancer ” he wrote in his memoir  adding a list of other maladies that included Crohn’s disease  high blood pressure  an infected elbow  a torn tendon in his right knee  and a blood clot  Not even a broken leg could keep him in his wheelchair  however  when it was time to pay tribute at the interfaith service to those killed and injured in the Boston Marathon bombings “If you watched the service  you saw the struggle I had ” he wrote about the effort it took to stand at the pulpit  His blunt description of his frailty was characteristically unsparing  Mr  Menino recalled tucking his elbows back as his son tipped the wheelchair forward  “Biting my lower lip against a twinge of pain  grabbing the lectern for balance  I stood up  The enclosed pulpit hid the line connecting my catheter to the bag on my wheelchair ”Once on his feet  in clear pain and in an international spotlight as he delivered the most closely watched speech of his career  Mr  Menino exhibited the resilience he praised in the city he loved “This is Boston ” the mayor said  “a city with the courage  compassion  and strength that knows no bounds ” n', '2014_404')",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

thousands of miles from the crush of their new celebrity back home  They barely knew each other  But that June afternoon  sitting together and picking at sizzling chicken fajitas  the two men understood better than anyone the whirlwind they had each faced the previous six months   t nIt was a lunch date between Bill de Blasio and Martin J  Walsh  the newly minted mayors of New York City and Boston  They had traveled to Dallas for a conference but broke away for 45 minutes of solitude at a no frills cantina “We talked about learning the job  how it’s been ” Walsh recalled in an interview  “We talked about snowstorms  He’s a former  city  councilor  I’m a former  state  rep  We talked about how this job is different ”De Blasio and Walsh both campaigned on a message of economic populism  vowing to tackle income inequality and dramatically expand early education  They shared an advertising firm  an education adviser  and staunch support from organized labor  And each represented a generational shift  replacing longtime mayors whose personalities defined City Hall Both men have endured criticism for being slow to fill top positions   De Blasio proceeded much faster   Both mayors faced early tests from stubborn snowstorms   Walsh earned significantly higher marks   And both mayors boycotted St  Patrick’s Day parades because of the exclusion of openly gay marchers  settled major labor contracts  and grappled with the deaths of firefighters  But their approaches to the job have been radically different  De Blasio has made an impression  for better or worse  on his constituents  For Bostonians  Walsh is like a new pair of shoes they like but haven’t worn enough to know if they are really comfortable   t nDe Blasio was a veteran of city politics and came out swinging with a sense of urgency  pushing big ideas  He has notched significant victories — funding for universal preschool  mandatory paid sick leave for employees — but he has also taken his lumps   See his political scars from a fight with charter school advocates and defenders of horse drawn carriages in Central Park   Walsh  a longtime state legislator  was new to municipal government and launched his administration with a vow to listen  That meant a blur of coffee hours and community meetings  He has sought to solve problems by committee  launching an affordable housing task force  27 members   a late night task force  24 members   and a universal prekindergarten task force  30 members   “Marty Walsh is much more content to swing for singles rather than home runs ” said Jeffrey M  Berry  political science professor at Tufts University  “There are some mayors who can get people to follow their grand visions  I don’t think Marty Walsh is a visionary ” Berry suggested  however  that “de Blasio has more to learn from Walsh than Walsh does from de Blasio ”“He can learn from Marty Walsh how to build victories from the bottom up rather than the top down ” Berry said  Walsh has taken cautious but concrete steps  Berry said  to build consensus and the potential for real accomplishments in schools  housing  and transportation  But Walsh could also learn from de Blasio’s willingness to take risks and spend political capital on a thorny issue  said Ray La Raja  a University of Massachusetts Amherst political science professor  “It would be nice for Walsh to take a big  tough stand every once in a while ” La Raja said  Walsh acknowledged that de Blasio has taken a much different tack “He hit the ground running a little quicker in some ways with deeper proposals and ideas already kind of vetted ” Walsh said  “I’m taking the approach of going through things          but  I could have gone in and made changes without understanding what is happening ” Take the push for universal preschool for 4 year olds  As candidates  Walsh and de Blasio both made it a central campaign promise and promoted creative ways to cover the cost   Walsh suggested selling City Hall  de Blasio pushed a tax increase on the wealthy   In office  de Blasio lost the tax fight but won $300 million in funding this year to immediately expand universal preschool  Walsh’s pre K task force has a goal of 2018 Last month at a budget hearing in a midtown skyscraper  de Blasio carried a gravitas unique to a mayor  He immediately became the focal point of the room Stark differences between the two mayors became apparent when de Blasio testified on behalf of his budget  He is a polished and concise orator  making deliberate eye contact with his audience  The rhetoric is loftier  with a tone that suggests de Blasio seeks to be more than a mayor  De Blasio reminded the audience that he was “elected with a particular vision of what the New York City government had to achieve for our people ” He referenced Franklin D  Roosevelt  whom he described as “a true example of all the good that New York City and New York State have done for the world ” before quoting the late president  “ ‘Too often in recent history liberal governments have been wrecked on the rocks of loose fiscal policy ’ ” de Blasio said  “President Roosevelt summarized better than I could the notion that if we want to pursue important ideals — if we want to reach so many people in need and create a more just society — we can only do that if we are fiscally sound ”Walsh does not share de Blasio’s rhetorical flair or refined delivery  The Boston mayor stiffens when he reads prepared remarks  His impromptu comments often meander as he repeats comfortable phrases  such as “City of Boston ” But when Walsh faces a scrum of reporters  he is jocular and he shakes the hand of each individual journalist  greeting television personalities and newspaper scribes by name  Walsh’s one on one charm was his strongest selling point on the campaign trail  People like him because he is a nice guy  Last month  de Blasio took a different approach with reporters  Aides limited topics for discussion  De Blasio folded his hands at his waist and remained cordial  but he seemed standoffish with a forced smile In fact  de Blasio has struggled with the press  His tardiness has angered reporters  he was skewered for eating pizza with a fork  and drew the ire of “Today’’ show weatherman Al Roker over a decision to keep schools open during a snowstorm  “He screwed up on image early on  but that’s a matter of learning the job ” said Maurice Carroll  assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Poll  “He seems to be doing OK as far as I can tell ” Some New Yorkers remain skeptical  Take Sue Z  Smith  a legal secretary from Queens who sat on a bench last month in Central Park and nibbled on almonds and apple slices  “I’m on the fence  He seems very patrician ” Smith said  “He tries to be very in touch  with common New Yorkers   but he isn’t  I’m still waiting to find out what he’s really about ” In Brooklyn  Natasha C  Grimes was still proud she voted for de Blasio   “As a parent  I feel he’s doing very well ” said Grimes  a 43 year old from east New York  “He’s a people person  He’s really for families ” In Boston  Walsh has been buffeted by external forces  Think about the prolonged battle over casinos or heft of the Boston Marathon bombing anniversary  Walsh lost two prominent staffers — a communications director and education adviser — but he has avoided controversy   “There’s been some bumps  some early resignations  but I think he’s steered a pretty good path so far ” said Maurice Cunningham  a University of Massachusetts Boston political science professor  Sitting on a bench on Boston Common  Sheldon Gilmore of Hyde Park said he did not have much of an impression of Walsh  “He’s still the new guy ” said Gilmore  23 A similar assessment came from Melissa Prince  a 28 year old from Jamaica Plain  as she tossed a stick to her dog  Charlie  “I don’t know if people have that strong of opinions yet ” Prince said as Charlie returned with the stick  “To be fair  he hasn’t had much time to set in the public consciousness ”', '2014_1084')",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

show’s comedy   nit isn’t the source of friction with his family — it’s that he doesn’t like sports  Gallivan  in an interview in Los Angeles  says he imagines the McCarthys living someplace like Hyde Park  where his father  Charlie  coached basketball for more than 30 years  All five of his siblings played basketball and many now coach at schools around Greater Boston  where all but Paul are teachers   n nWhile the rest of the kids were learning to pick and roll  Gallivan was corralling friends  family  and neighborhood kids into original theatrical productions during summer vacations on the Cape  “I was Mac in ‘Mac and Rosie ’ u2009” says Jimmy with pride  “It was over the Bourne Bridge Broadway ” Gallivan was also excelling as captain of the Dedham High School track team  a fact that his family says the self deprecating Brian fails to tell people  “I was running from my sexuality ” he deadpans   nAfter attending Holy Cross and receiving master’s degrees from the University of New Hampshire in literature and Emmanuel College in secondary education  Gallivan went into teaching too  But that early  theater bug persisted  and after school he found himself looking for laughs at Improv Asylum  Living with his brother at the time  John says Brian would “play Hungry Hungry Hippos with my kids and the next week work that into his act ” Success performing in the North End comedy club led to a leap of faith  He went to Chicago to join the famed Second City troupe and gave birth to his Web series  “Sassy Gay Friend ” That series — starring Gallivan in the title role  dispensing advice to famous literary characters  from Cyrano de Bergerac to Romeo and Juliet — and a spec script brought him to the attention of the producers of the short lived NBC sitcom “Are You There  Chelsea  ” which led to work on ABC’s “Happy Endings ” On the day that the latter series came to its not so cheerful conclusion  canceled after three seasons  “The McCarthys” was picked up by CBS   nThere are no direct parallels to Gallivan’s own siblings on “The McCarthys ” and there are fewer of them   “There’s bits of everybody scattered about so they can’t sue me ” he says Gallivan has gotten no shortage of notes from his family   “My brother saw stuff online from  a “McCarthys” press conference  today and already called me and said  ‘When one of my stories comes up at a huge press conference you don’t say ‘my brother ’ you say ‘my brother John ’ u2009” says Gallivan with a laugh   Back home in Dedham  all of the Gallivans seem eager to offer their consulting services  The series picks up two years after Ronny has come out and the family has more or less acclimated to that aspect of his life — although his actual family members would never utter some of the un PC lines on the show — but they still struggle with his lack of sports enthusiasm   nIt’s clear that humor runs in the Gallivan family  When discussing Brian’s own coming out  this exchange happens in quick succession  “What ” says Jimmy  feigning surprise  “Spoiler alert ” quips John  “So that’s why he didn’t want us to see it ” says Tricia  finishing off the joke Although the show began life as a single camera comedy over a year ago  what will air on Thursday is a revamped multi camera version   nlike the successful CBS shows “Two and a Half Men” and “The Big Bang Theory ” both of which will precede “The McCarthys” premiere   Having the live audience that the multi camera format provides was key  as was  apparently  having McIntyre’s fans in some of those seats “I think I was like ‘Oh we’ll see ’ u2009” says Gallivan of the format change  “I’m a Boston pessimist  so I thought well  we’ll  mess  it up somehow  So I was kind of shocked on tape night sitting with Mike Sikowitz  the showrunner  and thinking  ‘This is going well ’ A lot of it  I’ve got to give credit to Joey because I’d say a third of it was New Kids on the Block fans  and they brought an energy  “I thought  oh there are certainly things we need to fix and tweak but overall this feels like a show  And for me to feel even a hint of that means I’m pretty happy with it ” nThe show is filmed in LA  but if it hits  Gallivan hopes to return to the Hub to capture some local flavor for future episodes  He’s also hoping the decision to have the characters forgo Boston accents — save McIntyre and Dunn’s natural ones — will help earn the show some goodwill at home  “because it’s a really hard accent to do  and my family would not watch ”Back in Maryann’s living room  however  they promise they will watch  and support him  no matter what  And if it doesn’t work out  sister Tricia says  “We’re going to fix up the garage for him ”  n     n', '2014_460')",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

About an hour before  his son Ben Grossman and daughter in law Becky Walker Grossman had a son  Jacob  They’ll call him “Jack ” nNot quite old enough to cast a ballot    David Scharfenberg     Gubernatorial candidate Juliette Kayyem is among the crush of people in the Middlesex   Suffolk District section waiting to cast their votes at the DCU Center in Worcester Also waiting are Josh Wolf  Steve Grossman’s campaign manager  and Dave Marsh  Don Berwick’s policy director  Kayyem talks to the press as she waits  depending on her whips    essentially delegate marms who proctor the process

come here and don’t think about Charlie Baker is a bad path for the Democrats ”As more names are called  more votes are cast  she turns her attention to what’s happening behind her  “Oh  my God  OK  I

delegate calls out his or her favored candidates An occasional cheer or boo from a fellow delegate  Volunteers for the campaigns listen in  with tally sheets of their own This will take awhile    David Scharfenberg    This was the first convention for Jimmy Cawley and Elisa Birdseye  but their seats way up in the nosebleed section cut them out of much of the action  Candidates didn’t canvass the rows at the top of the Worcester DCU Center  and giant speakers blocked their view of two Jumbotrons Still  the couple from Hyde Park said they got their face time with candidates on Friday “But not up here ” Birdseye said “Down in the tiers ” her husband chimed in And despite their awful seats  the couple said they were having an awesome time  They had already decided to back Don Berwick for governor  Besides  Cawley said  he is no nosebleed newbie “I’ve been in these seats at a rock concert  the Grateful Dead  The stage was right over there ” he said  pointing way down to the convention floor That was nearly 30 years ago He also had one more observation on the difference between concerts and the convention “I go to lots of rock concerts  and even they’re not as chaotic as this ” he said  “But  now that it’s calmed down  it’s like every other dog and pony show ”   Akilah Johnson     As the gubernatorial candidates took the stage  there was uncertainty in one of the most watched corners of the convention  the delegation from the First Suffolk District  which runs along the eastern edge of Boston Mayor Marty Walsh had asked Boston delegates to support Warren Tolman  a candidate for attorney general  But he was not broadcasting a choice for the most watched race  governor On the floor  delegates said they weren’t sure how things would turn out “It’s a feisty  diverse district ” said Lew Finfer  a long time activist  There are Irish Catholics who have been in the district for decades  he said  and new immigrants  too Finfer  who is supporting Martha Coakley in the gubernatorial race  said he sees pockets of support for Coakley  Steve Grossman  and Don Berwick State Representative Russell Holmes  also backing Coakley  was equally unsure about where things are headed  “We’ll see when the vote happens ” he said   David Scharfenberg     It was noon and Democrat Deb Goldberg was on stage at the DCU Center  making her pitch for state treasurer  Where was gubernatorial candidate Don Berwick  Across the street at Uno Pizzeria  shaking hands and talking to uncommitted delegates  Actually  he was also talking to a few who appeared committed “Good to meet you ” he said  walking up to people finishing their lunches “Smart for you to come here ” said one diner  seated with two friends  “Someone gave you good advice  Try to convince me  Go head ”Berwick immediately started his 30 second elevator speech  Eradicating poverty is central to his campaign  as is a single payer healthcare system  also called Medicare for all There were 13 more minutes of handshakes  Thirteen more minutes of elevator pitches  Then  it was back across the street More handshaking  More pitches  Moving at a quick clip  he crossed the exhibit hall  “This young man just came to ask you about you ” a campaign volunteer said  as Berwick swung by his campaign table in the exhibit hall  Twenty seven year old Jason Wright was standing there curious  and Beriwck stopped  They exchanged salutations  And Berwick told the Milton resident  “I’m the most progressive candidate in the race  I’m for single payer healthcare  I’m against the casino ” Berwick stopped momentarily to watch Maura Healey’s speech  He wanted to hear just a few  As he listened  his wife  Ann Berwick  approached  He grabbed her arm  She leaned into him  And for a moment  they stood still together  Then  he was on the move again    Akilah Johnson      Sure  there’s the fight to get on the primary ballot and the tussle for the party’s official nomination  But neither is as entertaining as the battle of the buttons Warren Tolman  former state senator and candidate for attorney general  may have flashed a cheeky campaign video before his speech this afternoon  but his button is a bit more straightforward    the talisman of a political veteran “Democrat Warren Tolman    Attorney General” it reads  in dark and light blue  The this button was made by a union tag on the bottom    de rigeuer for Democrats    is particularly prominent The button for his competition  Maura Healey  has more of an outsider’s flavor  “Go Maura ” it reads  over a round  orange basketball    a reference to her turn as a professional basketball player Exclamation points are in vogue this year  “Go Barry  ” says the button for Barry Finegold  candidate for treasurer The current treasurer  Steve Grossman  is hoping a little poetry can make him governor  “Believe in Steve ” his button says  The frontrunner in the race is keeping it simple  “Martha Coakley ” her button reads  “for Governor ”  David Scharfenberg     Treasurer Steve Grossman  candidate for governor and prohibitive favorite for the party’s endorsement  stood before a gaggle of reporters    at once managing expectations and predicting a bump out of the convention Grossman declined to predict how many votes he’d garner on the convention floor  But he promised to come out of the convention with “an army of activists” supporting him  And he worked to connect himself to a pair of Democratic icons “That’s what I feel so good about    the energy and the army of activists  because from Michael Dukakis to Deval Patrick  no Democrat has been elected governor without that energy and passion behind them ” he said Grossman    his tie the orange and blue of his campaign signs    also took a swipe at Attorney General Martha Coakley  who holds a wide lead in public opinion polls “The contrast that I’m going to try to draw is a progressive job creator versus a career prosecutor  then let the people of this Commonwealth make a decision ” he said    David Scharfenberg   Chatting with fellow members of the delegation from the Second Suffolk district  Joao DePina  whose brother was felled by gun violence on the streets of Boston last week  cut the conversation short and eyed a volunteer from Steve Grossman’s gubernatorial campaign  “What are you giving out ” DePina asked “Towels ” responded Will Rasky  a Grossman volunteer and delegate from Jamaica Plain  In his arms were a stack of small  bright orange towels  a navy blue star in the background and Grossman’s name emblazoned across the front in white letters “What about ice cream ” chimed in Daniel E  Janey  who lives in Roxbury “That’s after you endorse ” Rasky quipped Grossman’s love of ice cream is well known on the campaign trail    so much so  that when he was asked recently at the Globe Opinion debate what he’d choose as an official state snack as governor  Grossman said  ice cream Janey said he was already leaning strongly toward Grossman before the towel  despite a friend’s hard sell for Don Berwick  He said he had met Grossman previously in his role as state treasurer  but what sealed the deal was a recent five minute conversation about…ice cream    Akilah Johnson', '2014_1214')",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
