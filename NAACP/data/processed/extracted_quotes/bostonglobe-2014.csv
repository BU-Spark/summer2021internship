The new Noodle Barn in Jamaica Plain is the most likable place, with its name stenciled on the wall and industrial lighting hanging as pendants with a pretty abstract light-bulb chandelier.The concept here is Thai and Vietnamese cuisine because partner Napat “Pat” Sriwannavit, raised in Thailand, is part-Thai, part-Vietnamese, and part-Chinese. She also co-owns Pho & I House of Noodle and Rice on Huntington Avenue and Beantown Pho & Grill on Newbury Street in the Back Bay, which have the same dual concept and similar menus.\n\t\nSriwannavit, who partnered with Phunthip Sittijirachote in this venture, opened the 58-seat spot in September to what must have been a warm welcome — the place is always busy. The previous tenant, Ban Chiang House, was a Thai restaurant the two women bought and renovated. The menu is all over the place, with something of a greatest hits quality. Thai dishes that are traditionally sweet and crunchy have those characteristics seriously amped up. Hot things are spicy. Portions are large, service is unusually quick and attentive.You’ll find everything from the classic Vietnamese crepe called banh xeo ($9), a folded rice-powder pancake, crisp on the outside, with shrimp, bean sprouts, carrots, cucumbers, and watercress, to tender pot stickers ($6) that have never stuck to anything. These steamed dumplings, filled with ground chicken, need their soy dipping sauce. Saigon salad ($9) features grilled and caramelized strips of beef on a bed of crisp salad vegetables with roasted peanut dressing.Also part of the Vietnamese offerings is bun, the bed of fine vermicelli topped with grilled, sweetened strips of pork ($9, chicken is also $9, beef $10), bean sprouts, mint, lettuce, fine shreds of jalapeno, and nuoc cham sauce. Pho here is serviceable ($9-$11), a fine broth that isn’t as intense and rough-and-ready as the big bowls in the Vietnamese restaurants in Dorchester.Vietnamese beef stew ($12) comes in a pot with deeply flavored anise broth, a hunk of tender meat (plenty of gristle), and a plate of steamed broccoli, zucchini, green beans, Napa cabbage, and more to tip into the pot, with rice.To honor the new neighbors, the cooks invented JP’s noodles ($10), named for this location. The wide rice-noodle stir-fry with chicken or tofu (add $1 for shrimp or beef), made with sriracha, is pretty hot, with eggs, bean sprouts, and lettuce. Pad see-ew ($10) also comes with wide rice noodles, tossed with eggs and Chinese broccoli in a dark, sweet soy sauce (add $1 for shrimp or beef). It’s a dish that you can’t stop eating, as is crispy noodle pad Thai ($12), with a shower of fine, deep-fried, golden egg noodles over chicken, sprouts, and egg, with a sweet chile sauce.Curry pots ($11-$13) offer that quirky Thai restaurant listing in which you choose the meat or seafood, then the kind of curry (green, red, yellow, Massaman, gang pah). This, with an ice cream scoop of rice, is good enough.Better is the ground chicken dish, pad gra pow ($11), spicy in a garlicky chile sauce with carrots, bell peppers, and basil. There’s a nice feeling in the restaurant, with any waiter passing by happy to help you. One night the TV is turned to the National Dog Show and after all the customers have been served, all the waiters turn to look at the screen. Shoop is on the sound system and customers and servers alike are moving to the music and watching the cute canine contestants.
Mayor Martin J. Walsh, exercising new authority granted by the Legislature, ousted all three members of Boston’s Licensing Board, replacing them with his own appointees.Walsh announced the move Wednesday in a press release that touted the new appointees but made no mention of former board members whose six-year terms were cut short. For more than a century, the board that controls liquor licenses had been appointed by the governor, but a state law passed earlier this year returned the authority to the mayor.\n\t\nThe Licensing Board’s newly appointed chairwoman is Christine A. Pulgini, a lawyer whose family law firm in Hyde Park was adorned with large “Walsh for Mayor” signs during last year’s campaign. Pulgini, who recently moved from Dedham to Hyde Park, contributed the maximum of $500 to Walsh’s campaign the last two years, according to state campaign finance records.One of the ousted board members, Suzanne Iannella, had a term that ran until 2020, according to the city’s website. Some of Iannella’s family members were supporters of Walsh’s opponent, John R. Connolly.In an interview Wednesday, Iannella said she was told Monday she was being removed from the board.“I really wasn’t so surprised,” said Iannella, who had been reappointed in June. “I understand that the mayor wants to have his team.”Walsh’s press secretary, Kate Norton, said politics played no role in the overhaul of the board.Walsh, in a press release, said: “The changes we’ve made to the city’s Licensing Board and our approach to licensing across the city presents a fresh opportunity to support economic development across our neighborhoods.”The overhaul altered the demographic composition of the board, leaving it without a Latino member, according to Walsh’s press office. The change occurred the day after the administration released a report from an advocacy organization highlighting the underrepresentation of Latinos in city government.The changes on the Licensing Board were part of a broader shake-up the last few weeks at City Hall as the new administration continued to take shape nearly a year after Walsh took office. Other changes included the resignation of Robert Shortsleeve, chairman of Boston’s Zoning Board of Appeal, who said in an interview Wednesday he voluntarily stepped down.“After 14 years of service to the city, I decided it was time to focus on other things,” Shortsleeve said.Walsh’s scheduler, Pamela Carver, is moving out of the fifth-floor mayor’s office for a new job at the Licensing Board, Norton said. Carver worked for Walsh when he was a state legislator and came with him to City Hall. Earlier this year when a reporter asked about women in influential posts in the mayor’s office, Walsh said Carver “probably has more power than anybody in the place.”Members of the Licensing Board, whose positions are regarded as full-time, regulate everything from hotels to fortune tellers, but their most consequential power is over liquor licenses, which have long been contentious. Liquor licenses can help spur economic development, but the number is limited by the state. Liquor licenses historically have been difficult to obtain, particularly in lower-income neighborhoods and communities of color.Councilor Ayanna Pressley spearheaded an effort to overhaul the Licensing Board, a push that was championed by Walsh. The Legislature increased the city’s limit of licenses by 75 and returned local control of the board to Boston’s mayor for the first time since 1906. Pressley issued a statement Wednesday thanking outgoing board members for their service.“We’ve increased the number of licenses. This is where the real work begins,” Pressley said in an interview, adding that local control will allow for more transparency. “I would love to see the operations of the board viewed online, and the overall improvement of community and resident feedback.”One of the other new appointees to the licensing board was Lisa S. Maki, a lawyer who lives in South Boston. Maki has worked for the city’s Law Department since 2010, according to Walsh’s press release.The third new member was Keeana Serene Saxon, a lawyer who lives in Roxbury. Saxon had worked as general counsel to the state Executive Office of Housing and Economic Development, according to the release.The members of the new board began their six-year terms on Monday. Salaries are set by state law, according to the mayor’s office. As chairwoman, Pulgini will be paid $100,000 annually, and Maki and Saxon will earn $85,000. None responded to an interview request made through the mayor’s press office.One of the other ousted board members was Milton L. Wright Jr., whose term ran until 2016. Wright is a retired first justice from Roxbury District Court who is well known in the African-American community. Wright could not be reached for comment.The third member removed by Walsh was Nicole Murati Ferrer, whose term ran until 2018. Ferrer will remain employed by the city and is “transitioning to a different role,” according to Norton, Walsh’s press secretary.“Suzanne Iannella and Milton Wright are no longer employed by the City of Boston,” Norton said in an e-mail. “We do not disclose the reasons for separation from employment.”
Investigators have determined “operator error” to be the cause of a November trolley accident, in which an out-of-service trolley hit another one with commuters on the Ashmont-Mattapan high-speed line, MBTA officials said. During an interview with investigators Tuesday, the unidentified operator of the out-of-service trolley acknowledged that he failed to properly secure the car, causing it to roll back and hit another trolley behind it near Cedar Grove Station on Nov. 26, said Joe Pesaturo, MBTA spokesman. \n\t\nApproximately five people were placed on backboards and evacuated, while a few others were evacuated using chairs, the MBTA said at the time of the incident. The T said all the injuries were minor.The driver, who was been employed by the MBTA for seven years, will be “subject to disciplinary action,” Pesaturo said. Pesaturo said the driver had not been charged with a crime, and he will “continue his employment with the MBTA.” Pesaturo said the driver was operating a Presidents’ Conference Committee trolley car, which was originally built in the 1940s and “completely rebuilt” in the late 1990s. 
Four Nichols College students are facing charges in connection with a November hazing incident that sent three other students to the hospital with alcohol poisoning, officials said.Evan G. Thompson, 22, of Longmeadow; Gregory M. Poll, 20, of East Granby, Conn.; Benjamin D. Harrow, 22, of North Reading; and Collin R. Geagan, 21, of Watertown, have been summoned to Dudley District Court on one count each of hazing and four counts each of procuring alcohol for a person under 21, Tim Connolly, spokesman for Worcester District Attorney Joseph D. Early Jr., said Thursday.\n\t\nThe four students — all members of the school’s baseball team — allegedly provided alcohol for an event involving the team on Nov. 7.Police brought the case to the clerk magistrate at Dudley District Court on Nov. 13. The clerk found probable cause to charge the four men on Monday, Connolly said.Thompson, Poll, Harrow, and Geagan are to report to court on Feb. 11.
A 20-year-old Bridgewater State University student was injured when she was struck by a car Wednesday night, officials said.Jennifer Delgado of Roslindale was crossing Plymouth Street near the Waterford Village Apartments complex at about 7 p.m. when she was struck, Bridgewater police said in a statement. She was not in a crosswalk. \n\t\nDelgado was treated on the scene and taken to Boston Medical Center. She is expected to survive, police said.Kathryn Tighe, 23, of Fall River was driving the vehicle. No charges have been filed at this time, police said.The crash is under investigation by the Bridgewater Police Department. 
While police work is often complex and subject to interpretation, the videos of a July police confrontation on Staten Island that led to the death of 43-year-old Eric Garner — an unarmed black man —show a clear example of abuse of power, miserable judgment, and excessive use of force on the part of police. Yet even in a case so utterly beyond the pale, a grand jury chose to look the other way this week when it decided that there was insufficient evidence to go forward with charges against Officer Daniel Pantaleo, a white officer who had placed Garner in a deadly chokehold.Once in the throes of a physical confrontation with suspects, police can legitimately claim in almost any case that they feared at some point for their safety or the safety of the public. Police managers, therefore, often examine the minutes preceding the confrontation to determine if an officer could have de-escalated the situation before the use of force became necessary. Well-trained, well-intentioned officers routinely find ways to resolve situations without resorting to force, especially when dealing with petty crimes. And petty is the only way to describe Garner’s alleged crime — selling loose cigarettes on the street. Garner practically begged the officers to leave him in peace.\n\t\nWhat is so disturbing about this case is the blatant combination of needless escalation by police and excessive use of force by Pantaleo, who placed Garner in a chokehold even as the prone suspect rasps repeatedly that he can’t breathe. The Staten Island district attorney saw enough to impanel a grand jury to weigh evidence and hear testimony from officers and civilian witnesses. The grand jury simply let the officer off the hook.The outcome is all the more shocking coming on the heels of a decision by a St. Louis County grand jury that declined to bring charges against another white police officer, Darren Wilson, who shot and killed Michael Brown, an unarmed black man in Ferguson, Mo. It is no surprise that grand juries will give police officers the benefit of the doubt given the pressures of law enforcement and the officers’ duty to protect the public. But these cases point in a different and dangerous direction: police officers who make no effort to resolve situations peacefully, and grand juries who make no effort to hold those officers accountable.\nPolice managers know that a small group of officers are often responsible for a disproportionate number of complaints by citizens. Within the past two years, for example, three men have sued Pantaleo over allegedly unlawful racially motivated arrests. While federal officials in the Justice Department conduct a civil rights investigation into Garner’s death, local police officials should be scanning their files for the names of officers who are prone to the use of excessive force. Minimally, such officers should be riding desks — not patrolling streets where they spread harassment, bad will, and, in the most tragic cases, death.\n\n• \n• \n• \n• \n
One week after a grand jury in Ferguson, Mo., opted not to bring charges in the shooting of Michael Brown, another grand jury — this time in Staten Island, N.Y. — decided not to pursue its case against a white police officer whose choke hold killed an unarmed black man. These are two different cases in two different states but the results are similarly controversial.Already, there have been protests in New York and Washington, and another , continuing the pattern of nationwide protests over the Ferguson decision last week.\n\t\nEven without the echo of Ferguson, the Staten Island case would surely have attracted attention, but now both are part of a discussion about race, police tactics, and criminal justice. If you’re wondering how similar these cases really are, what happened in Staten Island, and how often grand juries dismiss charges, here, according to published accounts, is what you need to know.\nA man named Eric Garner was allegedly selling black market cigarettes on the street when he was approached by New York police. As part of the effort to handcuff and arrest Garner, an officer named Daniel Pantaleo placed him in a choke hold. Garner was brought to the ground, where he repeatedly told the officers, “I can’t breathe.” He later died.The entire scene was captured on video.\n\nThe medical examiner , citing both the choke hold and the force applied to Garner’s chest. A history of  made Garner especially vulnerable. Choke holds have been  since 1993, according to a variety of news outlets.Just because Garner’s death was ruled a homicide doesn’t necessarily mean it’s a crime. It’s up to detectives, prosecutors, judges, and jurors to make the complex decision about whether a case like this should be brought to trial and, ultimately, what the punishment should be.\nWe don’t know. Grand jury testimony is generally sealed and any leaks can be grounds to restart the entire process. It’s true that information from the Michael Brown case was released to the public, but then virtually everything about that grand jury .\nYes, the grand jurors did see the video, and it didn’t sway them. That, alone, may be bad news for proponents of police body cameras — , who has supported the idea of providing 50,000 such body cameras to police departments nationwide. The NYPD is currently introducing body cameras as part of a , and  are considering the idea.In Garner’s case there was no body camera, but there was clear video footage, yet the outcome remains controversial.\nNo. The news site FiveThirtyEight.com looked at federal cases (which this isn’t), and they found that of the 162,000 cases brought in 2010, grand juries voted against indictment  (.007 percent.) Similar numbers for nonfederal cases are hard to get, but grand juries do seem generally inclined to support indictments.The big exception involves police. Again, there’s no definitive data, but  investigations have  that when police are accused of wrongdoing, getting a grand jury to support prosecution is far harder. That may be because police officers are especially trusted members of the community, and it may also be because prosecutors are reluctant to vigorously pursue cases against people whom they rely on every day.\nGrand juries aren’t like normal juries. They don’t decide whether someone is guilty, they just have to determine if there’s enough evidence to bring them to trial. They also follow very different rules than you’re used to seeing on television or in movies. Among other things, their work is generally not overseen by judges, the only lawyer is the prosecutor, and jurors can look at a much wider universe of evidence than would be permitted in court.The reason it’s called a “grand” jury is because it generally has more people than a trial jury (“grand” is French for big). Generally, grand juries have 16-23 people, whereas trial juries include 12 at most.\nGarner’s family could bring civil charges against Pantaleo, seeking damages rather than prison time. In a civil trial, you don’t have to prove your case beyond a reasonable doubt. You just have to show that you are more likely to be right, and that makes it easier to win.Also, Attorney General Eric Holder has already said that the Justice Department is pursuing a civil rights investigation, though the bar for a successful prosecution on those grounds is .\nAs with any protest movement, it’s hard to predict if it will spark change. But here’s one reason to think it might. Whereas the muddy circumstances around the Michael Brown shooting helped make it a divisive issue, the Garner video gives people a common vantage, which could bring them together in search of changes or reforms, including , a , or a requirement that police .
Wanted: Credentialed Islamic scholar, teacher, and worship leader, able to recite the Koran from memory. Must appeal to youth, unify a diverse international community, befriend clergy of other faiths. Patient, accessible, dynamic, humble; fluent in Arabic and English, also American pop culture and public relations.Finding the right person to lead New England’s largest mosque will not be easy. No one is as keenly aware of this as leaders of the Islamic Society of Boston Cultural Center in Roxbury, who moved their search for a new imam into high gear last month after the mosque’s first-ever cleric, William Suhaib Webb, accepted a new job.\n\t\n“We’re expecting a superman,” 14-year-old Hamza Mahmood said with a rueful smile after a recent community forum about the search.The cultural center joins a growing number of US mosques scrambling to find religiously qualified, culturally conversant leaders at a time when such leadership is vital, said Jocelyne Cesari, who directs the Islam in the West program at Harvard University.The need for strong American Muslim institutions — and capable religious leaders at their helm — seems particularly urgent at a time when the headlines are filled with news of beheadings by the Islamic State, an increasingly bloody Arab-Israeli conflict, and the still-fresh memory of the Boston Marathon bombings, whose lone living alleged perpetrator is about to stand trial.Boston’s most high-profile imam will have to speak to these issues internally and externally, while educating a new generation of American Muslims and helping to oversee a complex and increasingly crucial institution.\nMany mosques in America are dominated by one or two ethnicities, but the Roxbury cultural center draws Muslims from an estimated 64 ethnic groups, speaking dozens of languages. There are also descendants of African-American Muslim movements, as well as converts from various racial and ethnic backgrounds.It is diverse in other ways, too. Scientists and struggling refugees, grandparents and teenagers, new converts and lifelong adherents pray shoulder-to-shoulder, holding an array of political and social beliefs.The mosque has grown markedly in the last three years, adding programs for teenagers, converts, and classes on the spiritual and intellectual dimensions of Islam.Webb and his congregation built stronger ties with interfaith leaders — improving, in particular, their relationship with the Jewish community following years of tensions surrounding the mosque’s early leadership.And the mosque has immersed itself in civic issues, participating in a statewide campaign to expand gun control and bringing lawyers and activists to the mosque to speak. A health team offers free screenings and referrals, as well as connections to Muslim mental health counselors.“We are set on a course . . . to be welcoming, to be diverse, to be open, to reach out to our neighbors, to reach out to the interfaith community, to make a positive difference for Muslims in America,” said Hossam AlJabri, a board member of the mosque. “That is exactly the vision Imam Suhaib promoted, and that’s exactly the position we’re sticking to moving forward.”Many imams in the United States are natives of Muslim countries who trained overseas, said Cesari. Though knowledgeable, they sometimes lack the language skills and cultural fluency to connect with the next generation of American Muslims, build relationships with interfaith leaders, and challenge misconceptions about Islam in American society.The mosque leaders in Boston are “people who are well-educated, who are professional, who want to educate their children about Islam and also project to the outside a certain vision of an educated, enlightened form of Islam,” she said. “They will not compromise.”Webb, a convert to Islam, is a celebrity in Muslim circles, known for his charismatic sermons and writings on bridging traditional Islam and contemporary American culture. After serving the Roxbury mosque for three years, he is leaving to become resident scholar at MakeSpace, a young Muslim organization in Northern Virginia. He and leaders of MakeSpace, which aims to reconnect young professional Muslims with their faith, said they started talking about a match a year or so ago.“I was invigorated with the idea of my generation and the younger generation starting a congregation,” he said.Mosque leaders insist they have no hard feelings about Webb’s departure, and understand his reasoning. Still, some of those involved with the mosque — including some converts — are distraught.“I don’t think anybody can replace him,” said Mirtangelis Pena, a convert who studies at Bunker Hill Community College.In the last several years, said Nancy Khalil, a doctoral student in social anthropology at Harvard and a member of the imam search committee, the mosque was little more than a seed.Now, she said, “It’s a sapling . . . and it’s starting to blossom.”But tending its growth will be a challenge for the next imam.The next imam “has to be somebody who will make everybody feel welcome, period,” said Dunia Kassay, a student at Northeastern University who has worked as an intern at the mosque.The fledgling institution, with a staff of 11 and an annual budget of about $1.2 million, remains constrained financially. Monthly donors have more than doubled, from 150 to 370, in the last two years, but the mosque has less than six weeks’ reserves in the bank, and it has yet to raise money to put the finishing touches on its building.“A lot of Muslim institutions are very nascent, still growing,” said Yusufi Vali, the center’s executive director. “In my eyes, we are still so far behind synagogues and churches, but so far ahead of most Muslim institutions.”A small contingent of anti-Muslim activists in the Boston area has repeatedly claimed that the Roxbury mosque is fostering extremism. Those assertions have gained little traction but have proved draining for mosque leaders.\nAt the same time, mosque leaders realize that they have to protect vulnerable young people from extremist propaganda online and elsewhere.

104,Michael Brown,"""To those who watched Mark Wahlberg transform from a skinny Dorchester delinquent to a Hollywood leading man, the actor deserves a pardon for beating a man outside a convenience store in 1988.But to some who remember the havoc he wreaked in Boston almost three decades ago, the disclosure this week that Wahlberg  is infuriating.\n\t\nNam Pham, executive director of VietAID, a Vietnamese community organization in Dorchester, said Wahlberg should first apologize directly to Thanh Lam, a Vietnamese man Wahlberg beat with a stick more than a quarter century ago. Wahlberg also screamed obscenities and racial epithets.“If I were him I would want the scar on my record erased,” Pham said of Wahlberg. “But I would also ask if I could help erase the scars on the victim.”\n\nIn a separate episode, some from a class that was harassed in 1986 by a group of teens that included Wahlberg were not impressed with his request for a pardon.Mary Belmonte, the class teacher, remembered leading her terrified elementary school students down a side street to avoid the hail of rocks. “I’m sure he’s sincere and he wants to clear his name,” Belmonte said. “It would be nice if he could apologize and really own up to what he was.’’Wahlberg, 43, is one of at least 70 people who have applied for a pardon in the months before Governor Deval Patrick leaves office.Other petitions for pardons have come from a Georgia store manager who sold crack cocaine; a Sheffield father arrested in the mid-90s for bringing marijuana to his high school; and a convicted gang member turned street activist.Patrick this yearfor people to apply for pardons or commutations — reductions in prison sentences — leading to a flurry of applications. The guidelines were expanded to include those who pose no risk of re-offending and can show they have made extraordinary contributions to society.In his application, Wahlberg described the 1988 assault on Lam as the actions of a foolish high school dropout who was under the influence of drugs and alcohol. Wahlberg was 16 at the time.“I am deeply sorry for the action that I took on the night of April 8, 1988, as well as for any lasting damage that I may have caused the victims,” he wrote. Wahlberg said his conviction stands in the way of expanding his restaurant ventures and working more closely with law enforcement officials to help “at-risk individuals.”Wahlberg was sentenced to two years for the 1988 attack and served about 45 days in a Plymouth jail. Lam, Wahlberg’s victim, could not be reached for comment. Wahlberg’s publicist did not return calls for comment.Those who had encounters with the young Wahlberg differed on whether his pardon request should be granted. Those critics include people involved in the 1986 incident involving the elementary school children.In 1986, Kristyn Atwood, then 9, and a black classmate were on a school field trip at Savin Hill Beach when three boys began following them. They yelled racial slurs, according to court records, then began throwing rocks. One hit Atwood’s forehead.One of the boys was Wahlberg, according to court records. The state’s attorney general filed a civil complaint against him and his friends. The complaint was dismissed in 1987.“When people talk about racism in Boston, I always remember that,” said Atwood, now 38 and living in Georgia.Atwood was not aware that one of the teens who harassed her and her classmate was Wahlberg.He assaulted Lam, the Vietnamese man he encountered outside the convenient store, in 1988.“For him to try to get it overturned and make it seem like it never happened? I dont think that’s fair,” she said, referring to his request for a pardon.But Emmett Folgert, longtime head of the Dorchester Youth Collaborative in Fields Corner, said Wahlberg’s ability to get past his crimes and go on to achieve enormous success is inspirational.“He sure is a role model for anyone who comes from a low-income urban neighborhood and makes good,” said Folgert, who knew Wahlberg when he was a 13-year-old breakdancing at DYC, a non-profit center with the mission of steering teenagers and children away from crime.Wahlberg donates to the center regularly and every year sends hundreds of children living in Dorchester to summer camps in New England, Folgert said.“He’s never forgotten where he came from,” Folgert said. “He deserves a pardon. Absolutely he deserves to be pardoned. Look at what he’s done.”The Rev. James Flavin, who was a parish priest in Dorchester, counseled the actor when he was a teenager. The two men are still close.“His life speaks for itself,” Flavin said. “He’s really turned his life around in faith, family and giving back. They’re the hallmarks of his life.”Wahlberg’s bid, first reported this week by NECN, has some in the legal community hoping that the celebrity’s application will shed more light on a byzantine process that often forces people to wait months to learn whether they will have a chance to go before the Advisory Board of Pardons to make their case.“You file a petition and it’s sort of a waiting game to find out if you get a hearing,” said Rosemary C. Scapicchio, a Boston defense lawyer. “If someone high-profile like Wahlberg wants to get a pardon and he’s able to secure a hearing then maybe it gives a road map to the rest of us.”If Wahlberg is granted a hearing before the advisory board, also known as the Parole Board, he would have to answer questions during a recorded, public process. The board would then make a recommendation to the governor, who decides whether to forward the pardon application to the Governor’s Council, an elected body that has the final word whether a pardon is granted.Only 10 hearings have been granted this year; five of those cases were recommended to the governor, and Patrick has passed along four to the council. The last time pardons were granted was in 2002, during acting Governor Jane Swift’s administration.On Friday, Patrick declined to say whether he would consider Wahlberg’s application.“I don’t look at applications,” Patrick told reporters at the Statehouse. “I just get recommendations that come to me from the Parole Board, and I’m not going to get involved until something does, if it does.”If the board recommends Wahlberg’s petition and Patrick approves it, Wahlberg will probably have to go before the Governor’s Council for another public hearing. The council would then take a vote.Councilor Mike Albano said Wahlberg’s application shows he has changed.“If and when Governor Patrick .\xa0.\xa0. submits the petition to the Council, I am prepared to act favorably,” Albano said.Councilor Terrence Kennedy said he hopes to hear from the victim or his family if they chose to speak out.“I dont know anything about the crime,” Kennedy said. “I know he’s done a lot of good things and that’s what pardons are about. It’s for people who have changed their lives and want to clear their names.”\n\n• \n• \n\n""",

Mark Begich, North Carolina Sen. Kay Hagan and Arkansas Sen. Mark Pryor in defeat. Democrats ceded seats in Montana, South Dakota and West Virginia after incumbents opted not to run again.Like victorious Republicans in those races, Cassidy, 57, made his bid against Landrieu more about Obama than about his own vision for the job. An Illinois native, Cassidy made few public appearances during the runoff, seeking to avoid missteps that could change the race.But in a state where 73 percent of white voters on Nov. 4 told pollsters they ‘‘strongly disapproved’’ of the president, that was enough to prevent Landrieu from finding her footing. Cassidy also enjoyed a prodigious advertising advantage in the runoff: Of every dollar spent by outside groups during the one-month runoff, 97 cents benefited the congressman.Landrieu tried several messages over the course of her losing effort.Most recently, she had hammered Cassidy as unfit for the job and more interested in partisanship than helping Louisiana. She directed her most pointed criticism at Cassidy’s medical teaching job in Louisiana State University’s hospital system. Calling Cassidy ‘‘Dr. Double Dip,’’ Landrieu suggested he collected a $20,000, taxpayer-funded salary for little or no work, describing gaps and discrepancies in Cassidy’s LSU timesheets. LSU said it’s looking into the timesheet questions.She argued that the race shouldn’t be about Obama, but also targeted advertising on radio stations geared to the black community, where the president remains popular.Her anchor argument was that her seniority was a boon for Louisiana, particularly her chairmanship of the Senate’s energy committee, an important panel for this oil-rich state. But that argument was gutted on Nov. 4 when Republicans won the Senate majority, meaning Landrieu would have lost her post even had she won.
When I’m on the T, and the loud man with the beat-up sandwich boards and the wag-worn bible starts hollering in my face about where I’m ultimately headed (he says hell; I say Sullivan Square — same diff), I simply get up and move seats. When the cab driver is absently listening to a string of hotheads white-knuckling their landline receivers as they vent vitriol over AM talk radio, I just nudge in my earbuds and let the Stooges or Nina Simone take the wheel.\n\t\nAnd when you show up in my Facebook feed, casually choosing the word “thug” to refer to an unarmed black man killed by police (pick any example), or when you call a woman who comes forward after a long silence about a sexual assault an “attention whore,” or when you say, on World AIDS Day, that you’re pretty sure the AIDS statistics from the ’80s were activist inventions, it’s no biggie, I simply defriend you.Those first two instances make me sound like any other person going about his or her business in a biggish city. You deal with the world around you, in part, by more fully embracing the one within you. Tuning out any of the thousands of offensive snatches of conversation one encounters in open urban air isn’t just a coping mechanism; it’s a form of chilly grace that we extend to one another as de facto neighbors: Please, whoever you are, continue to suck. I will be over here living my different life. But that third example, though driven by the very same noise-control impulses, carries a different weight (especially these last few months), largely because of the increasing elasticity of the word “friend.”“You’re a socially conscious white person?” asks Boston-based blogger Spectra in a about the online aftermath of a grand jury’s decision not to indict Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson. “You don’t share  views? It’s disappointing to hear your friends say racist things? You don’t wanna talk to ? I hear you. I really do. But if you don’t speak to ‘them’ who will?”It’s a fair point. Regardless of how porous the borders of your friend list may be — and for me, like many, the decade between Friendster and Facebook saw a grand relaxation of the criteria for acceptance into my friendzone — sealing one’s circle is synonymous with enforcing one’s bubble. Regardless of how stretched beyond recognition the word may be, “friendship” carries within it an embedded sense of responsibility. Declining a chance to engage and possibly inform and educate others, no matter how far on the fringes of acquaintance they may dwell, does indeed seem lazy — choosing comfort over confrontation.On the other hand, those who do indulge their inclinations to post and push and protest often find themselves on the other end of the defriending. “I cannot stop talking about things I care about,” exhorted a Washington Post reader named “” to advice columnist Carolyn Hax upon noticing the retreat of his/her friends after a string of political posts. “I don’t want to live in an echo chamber of people who agree with me, which is what seems to be happening.”Hax responded by questioning what political posts accomplish. “One thing you aren’t doing is ‘talking.’ That implies exchange, which allows for nuance. Posting is a much blunter instrument.”The notions of control and entitlement that social media have cultivated within us — the feeling that I’m the mayor of Friendville, population 2,627, and the expectation that the Internet should only deliver that which I desire — do not resolve into the ideal disposition for reasonable discourse online. And despite how distant our connections to one another may actually be (indeed, a “defriending” often feels more like a “restrangering”), when confronted with viewpoints that run so wholly counter to our own, many of us struggle to find a middle in which to meet.A quick survey of around 50 people in my own circle reveals politically motivated defriending is far from uncommon. Fifty-three percent of respondents had defriended “Facebook friends” (i.e., relative strangers outside of Facebook) for offensive posts that were racist, sexist, homophobic, or indicative of what one called “general unredeemable ignorance,” with 74 percent having booted connections who rose to the level of “casual acquaintance.” Twelve percent had defriended “close friends,” and more than twice as many had cut loose “extended family members”; blood, it seems, is not thicker than bile. And while like many other social networks, Facebook offers a “hide” option to spare users from frequent encounters with offensive connections, many respondents viewed hiding content as too passive a gesture compared to the “finality” and the “clear message” delivered by a defriending (“like a dead fish wrapped in newspaper left on someone’s front door,” as one said).Others maintain a spectrum of offense: “I ‘hide’ when the posts are boring but harmless. I unfriend when I don’t want to be associated with them,” said one. “I use ‘hide’ for mild ignorance, unfriending for unyielding bigotry,” responded another.For those relationships we truly care about — the real ones, the ones that steer our course through life and lend us our emotional bearings — there’s a sense of obligation to engage with aberrant ideas that inevitably emerge between us, even if that engagement endures as little more than tepid tolerance or an awkward Thanksgiving. But do we owe any less to the strangers in our lives? By changing seats on the train or popping in my earbuds, am I merely confirming that my connections to those around me in real life is as illusory as those I so readily sever online? And isn’t this assumption that there’s nothing between us at the root of the very problems that divide us? Indeed, being socially conscious requires something like an actual social consciousness, an active understanding that societal wounds stay open even when our laptops are closed, and a willingness not to cop out, but opt in.
\n\n\n: High-speed rail via Worcester and Springfield that whisks passengers to Western Massachusetts in a matter of minutes, to New York City within an hour. Sound impossible? . And who better than Governor-elect Charlie Baker to initiate it? Baker downplayed his role in conceiving and implementing the Big Dig during the campaign. He shouldn’t. The long bend of history will prove that the investment was well worth it — even with the spiraling costs and problems with construction. The submerging of the interstate has helped to transform our city and its access to the harbor, launching the Innovation District, and rebooting downtown.\n\t\nThe new Boston-New York rail connection should be the crown jewel of an ambitious Baker administration transportation plan. Transportation is the one policy area that will have the most transformative effect on the state’s economy, growth, and job creation. From projects large to small, investments made to improve existing, or build new, infrastructure will bring the biggest rewards. (Disclosure: My law firm has represented the state Department of Transportation.) Case in point: Just the whiff of news that the MBTA was  caused housing prices to spike over the last five years by 37 and 25 percent respectively compared to 9 percent statewide, according to the real estate website Zillow. , “You could put a cardboard outhouse near a Green Line stop, and there’d be a bidding war.”Then there’s the project , which will result in 60 to 65 fresh new acres to develop in Allston — close to Harvard, MIT, Kendall Square, and virtually every transit corridor. Or, as former Transportation Secretary Richard Davey calls it, an “innovation district on steroids.”Another game-changer? The expansion of South Station — , himself a tireless advocate of public transit. That project would accomplish several goals at once: It would free up prime real estate for development, and it would unlock a neighborhood or two along Dorchester Avenue — essentially stretching the Fort Point Channel’s waterfront from South Boston well into Dorchester. The expansion could also eventually serve to accommodate an Olympic bid requirement for greater transportation bandwidth. All of these ambitions, however, will require Baker’s leadership, especially when it comes to financing them. Launching new capital investments of any scale has only become harder with November’s repeal of future gas tax increases, which will remove up to $2 billion from state budgets over the next 10 years. And despite  it doesn’t appear that Beacon Hill will pass new revenue measures any time soon.And some see investments made in transportation infrastructure as gentrifying forces that price out the poor. Yes, that might happen. But the trick to creating more housing — affordable and otherwise — is to create more housing, not limit progress by stopping transit projects. When the state builds transit, the city must respond with density — not single family homes at the rail terminus as we’ve seen in places like Hyde Park.In , Baker has said his early priority is the growing opiate addiction epidemic. That’s an important issue, to be sure (the state’s recent success with  illustrates an excellent route to go). Other observers might suggest his administration tackle education or human services. And, in fact, a strong state government must successfully implement many different initiatives all at once in order to be effective.Indeed, the new governor will have plenty of projects on his plate come January. Let’s hope, however, that figuring out a rail plan to get Bostonians to New York within an hour is among the first out of the gates. \n\n• \n• \n• \n
Prominent Boston clergy members have sent a letter requesting a meeting with the mayor, the police commissioner, and the Suffolk district attorney to discuss questions over how the police department ensures equal treatment for all residents.

Google Inc. finally relented to Jackson’s demands in May, triggering a domino effect across the industry.Jackson, 73, says he intends to hold the companies accountable for promises to make their workforces look more like the overall population. He met with Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella last week and had what he described as a ‘‘positive and productive dialogue’’ Monday with Apple CEO Tim Cook.He has another closed-door meeting scheduled Thursday with Intel Corp. CEO Brian Krzanich (Intel is hosting Wednesday’s workshop at its Santa Clara, California, headquarters). Next month, Rainbow PUSH will release the first of what Jackson promises will be an annual scorecard rating the diversity progress of major tech companies.‘‘Many of these companies had an unfounded fear that we wanted to disrupt them,’’ Jackson says. ‘‘We came not to disrupt, but to build. Inclusion will lead to growth.’’Silicon Valley, a place that prides itself on progressive thinking and meritocratic policies, has a lot of ground to make up. For instance, only 2 percent of the US workers at Google and Facebook are black and the number of Hispanics is below 5 percent at both companies. Cutting across the US in all industries, 12 percent of the workforce is black and 14 percent is Hispanic.  Meanwhile, less than one-third of the worldwide workforces at most major technology companies, including Google, Apple and Facebook, are comprised of women.Diversifying the tech companies ‘‘is going to be a multi-decade process,’’ predicted Gary May, the engineering dean at Georgia Tech University, which has a long track record for training minority students in technical fields. ‘‘But this isn’t rocket science. It’s going to be about how serious we are going to be about trying to fix this. We are going to have to put some resources and time into it.’’Google already has underscored its commitment to bringing more women into the technology industry by pouring $50 million into a program called ‘‘Made With Code’’ during the next three years and partnering with nonprofits such as Girls Who Code, which has been running summer educational programs for girls since 2012.President Barack Obama also is trying to prepare more teenage girls and minority boys for technology careers as part of educational programs unveiled this week. The initiative calls for major school districts encompassing New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Miami, Las Vegas, Houston and Fort Lauderdale, Florida, to starting offering introductory computer science courses to all students in high school or middle school.Liliana Monge, who runs a Los Angeles computer coding camp called Sabia.la for women and minorities, likens the technology industry’s reckoning with its diversity issue to what happens after a habitual drinker finally starts to attend Alcoholics Anonymous meetings.‘‘First you have to understand you have a problem,’’ Monge says. ‘‘Now, we are entering the second phase where the companies have to take the next steps to change.’’
Dozens of Harvard Medical School students were joined by faculty and staff in a 15½-minute-long “die-in” in the atrium of the Tosteson Medical Education Center on the school’s Boston campus Wednesday, a school official said.The demonstration, organized by the students, was part of protests nationwide by medical students Wednesday against the grand jury decisions not to indict two white police officers who killed two unarmed black men, in Ferguson, Mo., and New York City this summer.\n\t\nDean for Students Nancy Oriol said the demonstration began shortly before 12:30 p.m. at the center on Longwood Avenue. Oriol and Harvard Medical School Dean Jeffrey Scott Flier spoke to the gathering of about 100 students, Oriol said, following speeches from several students.Oriol said the students that spoke asked that the administration at Harvard Medical School and Harvard University join them in the protest, and acknowledged that the administrators had done so because they were present at the demonstration. The students — mostly first- and second-year students — then lay down, covering the floor of the “large” atrium, Oriol said. The students stayed on the floor for 15½ minutes: 4½ to represent the number of hours unarmed Ferguson teenager Michael Brown’s body lay on the ground, and an additional 11 minutes to represent the 11 times Eric Garner, the man killed in New York, told police he could not breathe before he suffocated.Oriol said the demonstration would have disrupted a lecture, but the lecturer and his audience delayed the start of the talk to join the students. 
The city’s historic hand-wringing on the retention of its college students may be misplaced, a report from the Boston Redevelopment Authority and the University of Massachusetts Donahue Institute says. Instead,  argues, a better indicator of the economic vitality of the area can be found in its growing population of educated young adults — regardless of where they went to school.\n\t\nBoston’s retention of the students who attend its dozen of higher education institutions has long been a concern for local officials and companies, as the area strives for an engaged, youthful workforce. Public agencies and business groups have offered incentives for graduates to stay, including  and  to internships and job programs.But despite the exodus of half of its student population each year, Boston may not have an issue with “brain drain” at all because the city remains able to attract and retain plenty of young workers, says the report. \n“The more important question is how many younger, skilled workers are choosing to be in Boston and the surrounding areas,” said Dan Hodge, the director of the UMass Donahue Institute. “How much does it matter if they were educated at BU or Dartmouth?”About 150,000 students graduate from Greater Boston colleges and universities each spring. Over the past decade, the percentage of graduates staying in the area has stayed steady at 50 percent, even as the number of young adults in the area has increased, according to the US Census. The reason for this disparity is twofold: Boston’s colleges are expanding – from enrolling 86,000 in 2000 to 101,000 in 2010– and the area’s young workforce is growing.“I think it’s terrific to have the incredible base of higher education that is in Boston,” said Joe Cortright, the director of the urban policy think tank . “It adds to the critical mass. The biggest attraction of young, educated people is other young people.” The number of 25- to 34-year-olds — young adults who are more likely to be permanent residents than transient students, the report said — increased 2.7 percent from 2000 to 2010 in Boston. In all, the young adult population of 20- to 34-year-olds comprises 48 percent of the city’s resident workforce, according to the .Whether they are educated in Greater Boston and stay or move to the Boston area with degrees in hand does not matter, the report argues.\nGraduates of public universities were more likely to set down roots nearby, a  by the New England Public Policy Center at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston found. In New England, however, roughly 70 percent of recent college graduates earned their degree from a private institution.The area’s most prestigious universities, including Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, report lower student retention rates than other area schools, according to a  by the World Class Cities Partnership. Predominantly commuter schools University of Massachusetts Boston and Suffolk University both reported graduate retention rates of 76 percent for the class of 2005, found the World Class Cities Partnership. Graduates of Northeastern University are also more likely to stay in the Boston area, in part because of the school’s cooperative learning program, the study found. “A lot of the businesses try to establish relationships with students from these colleges even prior to them graduating,” said Alexa Manocchio, a Franklin native and Northeastern University graduate. “I was very confident with my degree from Northeastern that I could get an interview and a job in that field.”But the area may still not have enough jobs, or opportunities for specific lines of work, to employ all the young adults who would wish to stay. A reported 190,000 students received degrees in the Boston metropolitan area in 2011, with 153,000 obtaining a college diploma or higher. About 71,000 total job openings arise each year, and about a third of those openings require the skillset of a college graduate, according to the Boston Redevelopment Authority and UMass Donahue Institute report.\nWhen Theresa Neumann was offered a job by Starwood Hotels and Resorts in New York following her graduation from Boston University’s School of Hospitality in May, she wavered. She had a boyfriend in Boston, and the majority of her friends were staying in the area. But the position in a hotel in Times Square was just too good to turn down, she said.“At age 22, I wanted the best job to propel me into my career,” said Neumann. “For my specific industry, (New York) is the mecca.”Of major US cities other than Boston, New York attracts the greatest share of Boston-area college graduates, followed by Washington, San Francisco, and Los Angeles, according  by the Boston Consulting Group. Alvaro Lima, the director of the research division at the Boston Redevelopment Authority, says that with Boston’s strong young adult workforce, there isn’t cause for concern when some graduates leave. Though not in they local workforce, they add to the Boston-area economy, says Lima.“When you have global universities, schools like Harvard and MIT, you are recruiting people from all over the world,” said Lima, adding that higher education is an export industry. “Then, you throw them back out into the global economy.”If Boston didn’t export a significant portion of its graduates, the city would see a glut of doctors, engineers, and politicians, not to mention nearly double its size in 10 years, he says. “It’s a great thing for the city,” said Lima. “The area charges lots of money to educate students here, and then exports them to the world. Then, alumni send checks back to their universities.”For graduates staying or leaving the area, jobs were a deciding factor. \nKamaria Moore, originally of Dorchester, decided to move back to Boston when she graduated from Clark University in Worcester in 2007.  \n“I like the professional opportunities I have here,” said Moore, 29, who currently lives in Quincy and works in the social work field. “I like the resources available to the people I work with here because that’s not always true in other places.”About 76 percent of graduates who call Boston their hometown stayed in the area following graduation, compared to 42 percent who came from elsewhere, according to the Boston Consulting Group.Despite not growing up in Boston, MIT graduate Anika Gupta said a job opportunity and a network of friends who planned to stay in the area influenced her decision to stay here following graduation last May.“I work in an industry where I could have chosen different offices around the country,” said Gupta, 22, who works as a management consultant. “I made the decision to stay in Boston based on these other factors.”Finally, not all graduates who leave, leave permanently. Brian Smith grew up in nearby Woburn. After graduating from Boston College in 2012, he left the area to pursue a sports communications internship program, first in Colorado and then in Michigan. After two years away, he got the opportunity to return to the Boston area to work for Hockey East.“I wanted to work myself back, but I knew to do that I had to leave,” said Smith. “I had to go out and experience other things.”
Evens Archer did not see Johnnie Bonnie as he allegedly raised the gun. Archer, 16, was standing outside a house party at Castle Court in the South End with his back to the street in the early morning of June 29, when prosecutors say Bonnie walked up behind him and fired a single shot into the back of Archer’s head.“Archer was not even looking at him,” said Suffolk Assistant District Attorney Nicholas Walsh, during 22-year-old Bonnie’s arraignment on a first-degree murder charge in Suffolk Superior Court Wednesday. “Archer staggered for a few moments and then fell to the ground. Mr. Bonnie ran.”\n\t\nArcher’s mother said her son did not deserve to die. “I’m mad, I’m angry,” said Lavon Rash, after the arraignment. “He took my son. He took a life. For senseless. He didn’t do nothing to him.”Archer was a senior at East Boston High School, a gifted basketball player whose room was full of college banners. He was popular, funny, with a talent for science and social studies. Maybe, he told his family, he would go to Morehouse College, in Atlanta.“Evens was a good kid. It’s just sad he had to go like this,” said Rash.\nIn court Wednesday, Bonnie pleaded not guilty to the murder and gun charges for Archer’s death. He also pleaded not guilty to a separate set of gun charges, in connection with a September incident where he was allegedly caught with a loaded revolver and a silver dagger near Ashmont Station. He was ordered held without bail. Bonnie, who has a tattoo reading “Blood” on his right arm, according to court documents, was already on probation for a 2011 stabbing when he allegedly shot Archer. He had served 2½ years in a house of correction after he and two others stabbed a man in the neck, chest, arm, and back in Downtown Crossing.\nBonnie’s father, Carl Bonnie, was murdered in 2009, after being shot in the face during a drug deal in Roxbury.Bonnie’s aunt and girlfriend attended the arraignment, and said Bonnie was innocent. “We’re gonna fight it until the end,” said his aunt, who declined to give her name. Bonnie’s attorney, Edward Hayden, said after the arraignment that Bonnie denies all the charges he is facing.Bonnie was not arrested immediately after the shooting. He was indicted by a grand jury last month. He was captured on video fleeing the scene of the shooting and dumping the pistol into a sewer drain on Shawmut Avenue, according to court documents. Ballistic testing confirmed that the bullet that killed Archer was fired from the gun Bonnie allegedly put in the sewer, according to prosecutors. Archer lingered for several weeks after the shooting, regaining consciousness for a time before he slipped into a coma and died. His mother said he could not talk, but was aware of what was happening. He turned 17 before he died. Archer’s brother, Devens Archer, 17, said that Evens was a popular kid who loved working summer jobs, making his own money and supporting himself. “He liked to relax and have fun and enjoy himself,” said Devens Archer. “He also loved life, he loved to live it to the fullest.”Archer said his brother did not know Bonnie. The first time Devens Archer said he ever saw Bonnie was at the party where Evens Archer was killed. Prosecutors did not provide a motive for the shooting. The death of a teenager who appeared to be on the right track shocked the young people who knew and loved him, said Emmett Folgert, executive director of the Dorchester Youth Collaborative, where Archer was a member. “It’s important for adults to tell young people that if they stay away from gangs, and they stay away from drugs, and they make those choices, and stay in school, they’re usually safe,” said Folgert. “This is tragic.”Archer’s friends visited him in the hospital, said Folgert. After the shooting, he said, they were afraid. They felt that if it could happen to Archer, it could happen to anyone. 
CAMBRIDGE — Students at Harvard Law School, joining their counterparts at a pair of other leading universities, have asked that final exams be postponed for students who have been “traumatized” by two recent grand jury decisions in Missouri and New York, and who have focused their energies on protesting racial injustice.“Unless you act now, you will allow the systematic underperformance of a great many students of color and allies on this campus on their exams,” a student coalition wrote  to law school administrators. “We cannot walk away from our pain, and we cannot ignore our call to act against the injustice that threatens our families and our commitment to the justice system.”\n\t\nLaw students at Columbia and Georgetown universities have made similar requests in light of the nationwide protests over the fatal shooting of Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager, in Ferguson, Mo., and the choking death of Eric Garner, an unarmed black man on Staten Island. In both deaths, grand juries decided not to indict white police officers, sparking national protests.The Harvard coalition, which includes a range of minority student groups, said the law school delayed exams in 1970 for students who participated in protests against the Vietnam War, and has policies in place for students who have personal emergencies that interfere with exams.“This is more than a personal emergency,” the students wrote. “This is a national emergency.”Students petitioned law school officials for the “opportunity to reschedule their exams in good faith and at their own discretion.”A spokesman for the law school said Wednesday that a longstanding exam deferral policy allows for “individualized consideration” of any request.“Our staff is available to consider all such requests and, more importantly, to provide students with the support they need,” said spokesman Robb London.Administrators have also provided students options for counseling and general support.On the Harvard law campus Wednesday, several Harvard students voiced support for extensions, saying people who had devoted significant time to civic activism deserved extra time to prepare.“It’s being sensitive to the times,” said Martin Njoroge, a first-year student. “There will still be time for finals.”Njoroge said that law students are understandably moved to protest against what they see as racial injustice in the criminal justice system.“We’re supposed to be learning about justice,” he said.But others were dismissive, echoing commentators who have mocked the requests as an absurd — and convenient — overreaction.“Gimme a break,” said one student. “Extensions are for students who have a death in the family, not because they have spent too much time marching in rallies.”The student asked to remain anonymous, saying his opinion would not be well-received on campus.Other students said they doubted that anyone would exploit the situation unnecessarily. Many students had exams Wednesday, and said they had been too busy studying to follow the debate.“I’m just plowing ahead,” said one student.“I have an exam right now!” said another, as she hurried through the rain.\n extensions to students affected by recent events. In a letter to faculty and administrators, the Columbia Law School Coalition of Concerned Students of Color wrote that \nAt Georgetown University, a coalition of students of color also demanded exam extensions, saying they had been “deeply affected, critically active, and emotionally damaged by these events.”The grand jury decisions have galvanized college students, and earlier this month, hundreds of students and community members protested in Harvard Square, and some staged a die-in by laying in the street.On Wednesday, students at Harvard Medical School staged a similar protest, as dozens and students were joined by faculty and staff in a 15½-minute-long die-in at the school’s Boston campus.The demonstration was part of a national campaign by medical students against the grand jury decisions.Nancy Oriol, the dean for students, said she and medical school dean Jeffrey Scott Flier addressed the gathering of about 100 students after speeches from several students.The students — mostly first- and second-year students — then lay down, covering the floor of the atrium. The students stayed on the floor for 15½ minutes: 4½ to represent the number of hours Brown’s body lay on the ground, and an additional 11 minutes to represent the 11 times Garner, the man killed in New York, told police he could not breathe before he suffocated.\n\n• \n• \n

The Boston school system, in a final attempt to ward off a state takeover of one of its schools, is tapping a Boston education nonprofit to run the Dearborn STEM Academy in hopes of sparking a rapid turnaround, school officials announced Wednesday.\n, formerly known as the Boston Plan for Excellence, will have three years to get the job done at the Dearborn, which serves about 300 students in grades 6-10.\n\t\nInterim Superintendent John McDonough noted the organization has partnered with the school system on a variety of initiatives over the past three decades and runs a teacher preparation program, which embeds candidates in schools, that has received national attention.“This is an incredible opportunity for Roxbury,” McDonough said. “This is an incredible opportunity for a population of students underserved over time.”BPE was one of two finalists. The other was \n, a school turnaround organization.In a statement, Mitchell Chester, the state commissioner for elementary and secondary education, expressed optimism about the proposal, noting that he had been concerned about the Dearborn for several years. Chester publicly warned the school system in September that he was contemplating receivership if the school system failed to appoint an outside operator.“I am pleased to see that Boston has taken an accelerated approach to the school’s turnaround and chosen an operator for the Dearborn,” Chester said. \nThe school system has bet a lot of money on a turnaround at the Dearborn. It is moving forward with plans to raze its more than century-old building in Roxbury and replace it with a  with cutting-edge science and engineering labs. \nRichard Stutman, president of the teachers union, said he supported the proposal as a better alternative to receivership.“We look forward to building a school that can thrive,” Stutman said.
""""""Kathy and Bonnie aren’t surprised some people in Roxbury want them to stay as far away as possible.“I can’t take it personal that they don’t want people like me walking around their neighborhoods,” Kathy said, sitting in a cozy, rose-walled living room at a transitional home on a recent morning. “There’s a stigma, that we’re dirty. I dealt with that stigma a long time.”\n\t\nThe heroin addict, 47, is 14 months into her recovery. She had somewhere she could call home until Oct. 8. That is when Mayor Marty Walsh  — after a bridge everybody knew for years was decrepit was finally closed.Now she and Bonnie, 33, and seven months clean, are sleeping on couches in the basement at Valentine House, a Roxbury home for women trying to escape their demons, run by Friends of Boston Homeless. Others are squeezing into other at-capacity facilities, or sleeping on cots and floors in makeshift shelters. They have all become the subjects of bitter debate as the city decides what to do with them.On Wednesday, the city, which appears to have been taken by surprise by the local opposition, backed off plans to turn the former Radius hospital in Roxbury into a facility that would have served Kathy, Bonnie, and 200 others.“We heard from the neighborhood,” said Walsh spokeswoman Kate Norton. “We are going to go in a different direction.”Project SOAR, the women’s program, may now end up in a former city treatment facility in Mattapan. But in the fiasco that is the Long Island bridge closing, nothing is certain.The irony is, when Kathy and Bonnie were using, they were often in Roxbury, hoping to score their next hits, climbing into johns’ cars even when they knew they’d get hurt.The risks were always worth it. Heroin was all. Kathy’s addiction took everything from her, including her daughter, who eventually began using, too. Bonnie isn’t allowed to see her two young daughters. Faithful only to their addictions for years, they know they’ve hurt a lot of people.“It used to be if I got arrested, it was a relief,” Bonnie said, crying. “I’d get to sleep. I’d have a blanket.”Kathy was first into rehab. Bonnie followed. After detox, they got into routines and work training. Kathy has a job at a Dunkin’ Donuts in Quincy, where her mother lives. It takes an age to get there, but it feels safer, away from too-familiar streets. Neither of them have been off drugs for this long before. Every day is almost impossible.“We’re wicked pray-ers,” Kathy said. “Both of us get down on our knees.”Maybe if people opposed to the Radius plan could see how hard these women are striving, they wouldn’t have been so angry about them moving in.“There were sick people there before,” Bonnie said. “We have a disease. It’s not cancer, but we’re sick, too.”“People can change,” Kathy said. “We didn’t think we could, but other people thought we could.”A lot of people in Boston don’t believe that. Or at least, not enough to risk having addicts move into their own neighborhoods. The citys clumsy handling of the crisis hasn’t helped.The bridge closing is forcing the city to confront the limits of its compassion. So far, we’ve learned it’s way easier to care about people like Kathy and Bonnie when they’re living on an island in the middle of the harbor.And, in a way, being out there was easier for them, too.“Sitting there at night, it’s so peaceful.” Bonnie said. “There were so many times I wanted to leave, but I’d sit on the pier and think about the consequences. There’s a serenity out there.”At night, Kathy would go outside to pray. “I’d look up at the stars,” she said. “\u2009‘God, I know you’re out there.’\u2009”Wouldn’t it be nice if this blessed city were a place where Kathy could feel that presence, too?\n""""""
City officials on Wednesday nixed the leading proposal to house many of the recovery programs that have remained in limbo since the bridge to Long Island on Boston Harbor closed in October.The decision to abandon the proposal to move more than 200 beds to the former Radius Hospital in Roxbury, which closed this year, came after neighbors raised concerns about the impact on their community.\n\t\n“We heard their feedback and recognized the need to go in a different direction,” said Kate Norton, a spokeswoman for Mayor Martin J. Walsh. City officials had said Radius was large enough to house nearly all the addiction recovery programs that were on the island. They said it could have opened relatively quickly with modest adjustments, and could have been configured to increase capacity. Those who ran the shuttered programs said they are now searching for new options, but they worry they will face similar obstacles elsewhere.“It’s discouraging and disappointing,” said Jonathan Scott, president of Victory Programs, which lost 47 beds for women in a residential treatment facility. “The siting of any human service program is always an odyssey.”He and others expressed shock at some of the comments at an emotional meeting about the Radius proposal that city officials hosted last week in Roxbury. “Someone shouted ‘we don’t want those garbage and trash people in our neighborhood,’” Scott said. “I would like everyone to understand they’re not garbage and trash. They’re moms and kids making a heroic effort to start over again without alcohol or drugs.”But others said there were legitimate concerns raised.State Senator Sonia Chang-Diaz, whose district includes Roxbury, said she was open to the programs moving to Radius, until she heard from all the opponents.“It’s too close to schools and playgrounds,” she said. “It’s an area residents have worked very hard to build up.”City officials have also yet to decide where to house some 450 homeless people who have been sleeping on cots and mats in improvised shelters since the island closed in October.Authorities are considering building a shelter on city property along Frontage Road in South Boston. But they have yet to break ground and continue to explore other options.Norton said city officials expect to make a final decision about where to house the homeless this week.\n\n•\n• \n• \n• \n• \n• \n• \n
Commissioner Roger Goodell and NFL owners made a powerful statement on Wednesday when the league announced a new personal conduct policy to define penalties for unlawful or inappropriate behavior: “This is our league. And Roger still runs the show.”Certainly the new policy, which was formulated over the last three months and applies to all NFL personnel — players, coaches, staffers, referees, owners, and even Goodell — is “significantly more robust, thorough, and formal,” as the league stated in a press release. All 32 owners passed it at the league’s quarterly meetings in Dallas.\n\t\nGone are the days of Goodell handling disciplinary meetings in the shadows and making up punishments as he goes along. That’s what got Goodell in hot water this fall with Ray Rice. He willfully ignored hard evidence and initially handed Rice a too-light two-game suspension, then a too-harsh indefinite suspension — which was recently overturned by an arbitrator — when the tide of public perception turned against Goodell.Goodell touted the new policy as “clear, formal, consistent, and transparent.”This is good for the players as well as for the league. No more back-room shenanigans or unequal justice based on your salary or number of Pro Bowl selections. Everyone will now be treated equally and fairly.Of course, a cynic might point out that this is also a good way for the NFL to cover its you-know-what after it was forced to make things up on the fly this fall with regard to Rice, Adrian Peterson, and Greg Hardy and their domestic violence incidents. Precedent and the letter of the law can now rule the way instead of putting the matter into Goodell’s hands.The NFL now has formal “leave with pay” procedures, in which players will continue to be paid but not allowed on the field when there are formal charges levied against anyone charged with a crime of violence (time missed during paid leave will not count toward any potential suspension). Goodell will now have expert advsiers on retainer to help evaluate a potential violation of the policy. The NFL will now have a committee to review the policy at least once a year. And the rules clearly state that a conviction isn’t necessary for the NFL to mete out its own punishment, especially if the incident involved a violent crime.“We now have a layered evaluation process to take into account a diversity of expert views,” the NFL said in its press release. “This will better enable us to make appropriate decisions and ensure accountability for everyone involved in the process.”But make no mistake, the NFL remains “judge, jury, and executioner” in all matters concerning discipline, with Goodell as the ringleader. Yes, there are now more voices involved in the process. But they are all operating under the NFL umbrella, and Goodell retains ultimate authority.Investigations into violations of the conduct policy? Still done by NFL security. The independent advisers? Chosen by the NFL.The disciplinary officer who will hand out the initial discipline of a conduct policy violation? A member of the league office staff. The automatic six-game suspension for players charged with a violent crime? The league office can increase it at will, “with consideration given to any aggravating or mitigating factors.”The conduct committee that will review the policy each year? Comprised of five owners, two relatives of owners, and two former players that are now part of NFL ownership (Warrick Dunn and John Stallworth).And the appeals process? “The commissioner may name a panel that consists of independent experts to recommend a decision on the appeal.” Key word: may.In other words, Goodell will continue to hear all appeals. The NFL contends that Article 46 of the collective bargaining agreement gives Goodell the power to do so, and he will continue to take full advantage of it. And if Goodell decides to recuse himself in a certain case, it will be heard by a panel of experts chosen by Goodell.The NFL Players Association has complained throughout the process that the NFL refused to collectively bargain the new policy with the union. It’s not an unreasonable request, given that the policy will affect the players the most.The NFL touted that it consulted with 47 outside organizations — including Mothers Against Drunk Driving, Children of Domestic Violence, and Black Women’s Roundtable — in creating the new policy. Former players and their wives were consulted, as well.The NFLPA was one of the 47. Wednesday’s press release from the league was the first time the union had seen the new personal conduct policy.“Our union has not been offered the professional courtesy of seeing the NFL’s new personal conduct policy before it hit the presses,” the NFLPA said in a statement. “Their unilateral decision and conduct today is the only thing that has been consistent over the past few months.”The new policy isn’t all about punishment, though. To its credit, the NFL is putting a lot of resources into providing education regarding respecting and appropriate behavior, and resources for players and families in need of counseling, social services or specialists.“The league’s goal is to prevent violations of the personal conduct policy,” it said in its release.And, clearly, to keep the power in the hands of Goodell and the owners.\n\n\n\xa0\n\n\xa0\n\n\xa0\n
\nSouth Enders tired of driving 10 whole minutes to the Fenway Whole Foods won’t have to wait much longer: The grocer’s Harrison Avenue location will open its doors Jan. 9, 2015. The 50,000-square-foot store will be the chain’s 30th location in Massachusetts and its largest in Boston. In addition to the usual assortment of groceries, hot food, and alcohol, the new location will include an in-store spa featuring manicures, pedicures, shaves, and shoe shines. It’s situated in a much larger development, called the Ink Block, that  restaurants, stores, condos, and apartments on the site of the former Boston Herald building. Instead of a ribbon-cutting, Whole Foods is planning on having local dignitaries and company officials break a giant loaf of bread. \n\nThe Royal Bank of Scotland is likely to sell its majority share in Citizens Financial Group in late March or early April, Bruce Van Saun, the chief executive officer of Citizens, said on Wednesday during a stop in Boston. Van Saun said the decision will ultimately be up to RBS. Van Saun was at the Langham Hotel’s chandeliered meeting room with many of the bank’s Boston law firm clients for a steak au poivre lunch. RBS, which has owned Providence-based Citizens since 1988, is shedding its stock in the US bank and in September sold a quarter of its share in a public offering. It plans to sell off the remainder in parts until it completely divests in 2016. \n\n\n\t\nWASHINGTON — Under pressure from Congress to speed access to US skies for commercial drones, the government granted four companies permission Wednesday to use drones for aerial surveillance, construction site monitoring, and oil rig inspections. The decision brings the total number of companies granted permits for commercial operations to 13. Commercial drone flights are taking off in other countries while the US lags in developing safety regulations that would permit such unmanned aircraft operations by a wide array of industries, Gerald Dillingham of the Government Accountability Office told a panel of House lawmakers. \n\n\nSAN FRANCISCO — Civil rights leader Jesse Jackson and tech leaders held a Silicon Valley summit Wednesday to address the glaring scarcity of women, blacks, and Latinos at companies renowned as great places to work. In a show of their commitment, Google, Apple, Facebook, and more than 20 other tech companies sent representatives to the forum held at the Santa Clara, Calif., headquarters of Intel Corp. Silicon Valley has a lot of ground to make up. For instance, only 2 percent of the US workers at Google and Facebook are black and the number of Hispanics is below 5 percent at both companies. Cutting across the United States in all industries, 12 percent of the workforce is black and 14 percent is Hispanic. Meanwhile, less than one-third of the worldwide workforces at most major technology companies, including Google, Apple and Facebook, are women. \n\nNEW YORK — McDonald’s is planning to trim its menu, review its cooking methods, and maybe even get rid of some of the ingredients it uses to change perceptions that it serves junk food. CEO Don Thompson sought to reassure investors Wednesday that such changes will help strengthen the chain’s appeal as it fights to hold onto customers. Starting next month, he said, McDonald’s will cut eight items from the menu and reduce the number of Extra Value Meals from 16 to 11. McDonald’s is looking at different cooking and holding procedures to enhance the appeal of its core items, as well as shrinking the number of ingredients it uses. The company also is making a big push behind a ‘‘Create Your Taste’’ program that lets people pick the buns, cheeses, and topping for their burgers. McDonald’s says that will be in 2,000 of its more than 14,000 US locations next year. \n\nWASHINGTON — Federal regulators are proposing that the eight biggest US banks be required to further increase the amount of capital they set aside to cushion against unexpected losses. The Federal Reserve’s proposal is aimed at reducing the potential for future taxpayer bailouts of troubled banks. The proposed requirements also are designed to encourage the behemoths to shrink so they pose less risk to the financial system. The banks include JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, and Bank of America. \n\nBOISE — More than 150 cattle valued at about $350,000 have been reported missing in southeastern Idaho, and authorities suspect modern-day cattle rustling as beef prices have soared. ‘‘Right now it’s just insane what those things are worth — it scares me to death,’’ Idaho state brand inspector Larry Hayhurst said. ‘‘Which means the incentive is there.’’ Ranchers say roundup searches in recent weeks in the hills and gulches on the remote summer range where the cattle graze have come up empty in two counties. The losses include a herd of 50 black angus consisting of 25 cows and 25 calves valued at $150,000. Another herd of 41 cow-calf pairs, meaning 82 animals total, plus 10 cow-calf pairs, or 20 animals, from another rancher are also missing. Those missing cattle are valued at about $200,000. \n\nSAN FRANCISCO — California prosecutors are suing Uber over the ride-booking company’s background checks of drivers and other allegations. The lawsuits filed Tuesday in San Francisco Superior Court are the latest legal hurdles to confront the nascent ride-hailing industry, which has also been facing regulatory issues over whether the businesses are regulated taxi services or app-making technology companies. Lyft has agreed it will no longer say its background checks are the ‘‘gold standard.’’ Lyft agreed to pay $500,000 and submit its fare-setting app to the state regulators to ensure it’s fairly charging riders. It also agreed not to do business at any airport unless it receives a permit.\n\n\n\n\nKANSAS CITY, Mo. — Hallmark Cards Inc. has removed blue and silver gift wrap from circulation after a customer complained that she saw a swastika embedded in the design. The company alerted retailers to the problem Monday after receiving a complaint Sunday night from a Walgreen’s customer in Northridge, Calif. The disputed wrap was featured in a Hanukkah display, but Hallmark spokeswoman Julie Elliott says the gift wrap wasn’t intended for the Jewish holiday. The Kansas City Star  the gift wrap was distributed by Walgreen’s, which is no longer selling it. Elliott said in a news release that Hallmark didn’t intend to offend anyone. \n\n\n\nWASHINGTON — The federal government’s deficit for the first two months of the new budget year is down 21 percent from the same period a year ago, although much of that improvement stems from quirks in the calendar. The Treasury Department said Wednesday the deficit for November totaled $56.8 billion, a drop of 58 percent from last year’s November deficit of $135.2 billion. However, the calendar heavily influenced the changes by shifting payment dates for various government benefits. Adjusting for those changes, Treasury says the deficit this year is still 6.8 percent lower than last year. \n\n
A state trooper who can be seen in an online video apparently squirting pepper spray at a protester in Boston has been placed on restricted duty while the incident is investigated, State Police said Wednesday.The trooper, whom State Police will not identify while the investigation is ongoing, appears to shoot two quick bursts of the eye irritant at Kin Moy as he videotaped \na demonstration protesting grand jury decisions not to indict white police officers in the deaths of unarmed black men in Ferguson, Mo., and New York City. Moy posted the  last week.  \n\n\t\nMoy can been seen with an orange liquid running down his face near the end of the 39-second video. A statement from State Police, which did not refer to Moy by name, said the person who posted the video has not responded to several requests to contact investigators; the requests were conveyed in YouTube comments, and in messages left at his home and a local gym, and with a relative, it said. Moy did not respond to requests for comment sent by the Globe through social media on Wednesday. Moy, who is a mixed martial arts fighter, on Wednesday evening posted a message on Twitter saying that he is preparing for a competition on Saturday, and “will not be replying to calls or messages regarding last Thursday’s incident until after.” On Monday, the Massachusetts chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union announced that it was in contact with Moy, and is “deeply concerned” whenever the First Amendment right to record police officers performing their duties is threatened. \n\n• \n• \n• \n• \n
If you need a reminder that awards season in general and the Golden Globes in particular are never to be taken seriously, the three nominations for “Big Eyes” should suffice. That film — a toxically high-spirited account of how Walter Keane stole credit for those campy 1960s waif paintings from his wife, Margaret — is one of the worst of the year and one of the worst in director Tim Burton’s career. Still, the Hollywood Foreign Press Association nominated it for awards for best actor in a musical or comedy (Christoph Waltz’s grating performance as Walter), best actress in a musical or comedy (Amy Adams’s numb Margaret Keane), and best original song.The nominations, announced Thursday morning, mark the official opening bell of Oscar season; coming after the major critics’",

\nWhen Katie O’Halloran reaches out to shake your hand, you can hear the whir before you feel her grip. It’s a slow process, and an awkward one, but because she’s waited two decades, each handshake feels like a victory. For much of her 23 years, O’Halloran relied on her left foot to do such tasks as eat, apply makeup, and text friends on her iPhone. The native of Galway, Ireland, was born with no arms and partially disabled legs and was never expected to walk. She ignored those predictions and went on to win gold medals at paralympic running and swimming events. She also graduated from law school.\n\t\nBut she opted against the available arm prosthetics. They all seemed clunky and unwieldy. When a friend in Boston heard about Dorchester’s United Prosthetics and its unusual expertise in fitting arm prosthetics, however, O’Halloran decided it was worth a trip to Massachusetts. For every 50 leg amputations in the US, there is only one that involves an arm or shoulder, according to the American Academy of Orthotists and Prosthetists, so it is a rare center that fits arms and legs. But upper-arm devices have become something of a specialty for United Prosthetics, which fitted O’Halloran with a new set of  arms in October.  The Martino family has been providing  limbs — and by extension, a better quality of life — for its patients for four generations. These days, United Prosthetics is run by the grandchildren of Philip Martino, an Italian immigrant who in 1914 incorporated what was then United Limb and Brace in Boston’s Scollay Square.  Martino was a master craftsman with wood, and he registered at least two patents for improving the design of peg legs, one of them for a more comfortable version of the wooden socket. After Philip died, his son, Joseph, who was an aircraft mechanic in World War II, took over and moved United Limb and Brace to a two-story building on Berkeley Street. That workshop is vividly remembered by the present-day Martinos.  Joseph would bring his children into the shop and set them down with a log and a pile of nails, leaving them to hammer patterns into the wood while he worked. “You had a lotta wood, a lotta dust,” said Paul Martino, who runs the firm with his brothers, Greig and Gary; sister, Mary; and son, Chris.At his workstation in the basement, Paul Martino keeps a row of child-sized wooden feet as keepsakes from his early days at the firm.Back then, many of the crew were amputees, men who came in as patients and came back to work for Joseph because they couldn’t practice their trade after their injuries. “A lot of these guys were cobblers or shoemakers, people who knew leather, knew metal, and who knew wood,” Martino said.Today, carbon fiber and electronics have replaced wood and leather, and as the business has specialized and diversified, so have the Martinos. Greig Martino, who fitted Katie O’Halloran, joined the company in 1973, just as the first myoelectric arm prostheses were being developed.While Paul specialized in leg amputations and hip fittings, Greig learned about arms, working with the manufacturers themselves. \nTitanium shafts, joints, knees, and mechanical and hydraulic feet are shipped in from other limb makers — but the Martinos keep the business of socket fittings in-house. Greig and Paul measure patients, making plaster-of-paris casts for the sockets that connect people to their prosthetics. Gary, the youngest brother, turns those into carbon fiber and acrylic sockets that are baked into shape in an infrared oven.Of course, getting fitted with a new limb is just the first stage. After Greig fitted O’Halloran with a set of arms, her biggest challenge has been getting used to their weight.Her new right arm is designed to translate complex instructions from upper-arm muscles into natural movements of the arm’s joints. But O’Halloran, who had no arms while growing up, has to guess  at how her muscles will perform even simple tasks. “That’s the hardest thing: Learning the sequence of how people with arms and fingers do things,” she said. 
\n take some time to scrub anti-Semitism completely out of the substructure of Wellesley College. It’s stubborn stuff, like the admissions quotas on Jewish students during the 1940s, the outright hostility to Jewish scholars in the college’s religion department during the 1960s and ’70s, and the 1990s-era professor whose bigoted diatribes included false accusations against Jews for “monumental culpability” during the transatlantic African slave trade.\nof Wellesley College’s Jewish chaplain and director of the Hillel student organization may well turn out — as the college contends — to be part of a broader consolidation effort aimed at hiring a full-time rabbi and providing higher level support for the college’s roughly 250 Jewish students. But it sure stirred up some memories for me.\n\t\nIn 1983, while reporting for the Jewish Advocate weekly newspaper, I received copies of correspondence written in April 1970 between then Wellesley president Ruth Adams and religion professor Roger Johnson on the sore topic of appointing a Jewish chaplain at the college. If prizes were awarded for genteel anti-Semitism, these letters would be contenders.Johnson anticipated the need for “a Yiddish-speaking corridor at Tower Court.” And in the event that the all-women’s college should become coed, Johnson suggested that the Jewish chaplain must “possess those skills necessary for the rite of circumcision” as a way to serve male students contemplating “possible conversion to Judaism.” Johnson signs off, “shalom.”Obviously touched, Adams raised the likelihood of Jewish weddings at the college. She mused on the material used for Jewish wedding canopies and the need for the college to gain “experience in merchandizing so that we can get full value.” Next she turned to the need for a “resistant surface” on the floor of Houghton Memorial Chapel to accommodate the “ritual smashing of glassware” at Jewish weddings. “Does one buy cheap glassware, which by its very cheapness tends to be large, heavy and unbreakable, thus defeating the symbolic aim: or does one buy expensive, slender crystal, the slivering of which one can rely upon?” Adams signs off, “shalom yourself.”By 1983, Adams had decamped for Dartmouth. But I did manage to track down Professor Johnson at the time for an in-person interview. He cited “a college phobia” over a Jewish chaplaincy. I’ll say.During the 1930s and ’40s, Wellesley College managed its discomfort with Jews by limiting their enrollment to about 10 percent. Even decades later, Jewish professors were deemed incapable of teaching courses on the New Testament. It wasn’t until 1981 that a Jewish professor received tenure in the religion department, and only then after hiring a lawyer who went about documenting the history of discrimination against Jews at the college.As anti-Semitism took on new forms, Wellesley College adjusted. In the 1990s, Africana studies professor Tony Martin assigned his students a Nation of Islam tract that inaccurately depicted Jews as the foremost figures in the African slave trade. When challenged by historians and others, he lashed out with an anti-Semitic book of his own, “The Jewish Onslaught.” In a letter to alumnae and parents, then Wellesley president Diana Chapman Walsh denounced Martin’s book as divisive and offensive. But she studiously avoided calling it anti-Semitic, which reinforced the belief that college administrators were afraid to name and confront what existed — and had long existed — before their eyes.Jerold Auerbach, a former professor of modern American and Jewish history at Wellesley College, said that many elite colleges share a history of Jewish quotas and anti-Semitism. What troubles Auerbach is “the persistence and duration of anti-Semitism at Wellesley College long after others took action to stop it.”Now some Jewish students at Wellesley College are worried about losing their familiar chaplain and Hillel director at roughly the same time that a chapter of the Students for Justice in Palestine has emerged on campus. A recent poster campaign by the group invited students to write comments under the headline, “What Does Zionism Mean to You?” Among the vacuous responses were posts accusing Israel of apartheid and genocide. The pro-Palestinian activists at Wellesley cite measures they have taken to discourage anti-Semitic posts. Students for Justice in Palestine chapters on other campuses, however, have shown no compunction about harassing Jewish students, prompting some colleges to sanction or temporarily suspend the activities of the pro-Palestinian students.Wellesley is working with Hillel International, the largest Jewish campus organization in the world, to bring on a full-time rabbi this fall. That’s a big commitment for a small college. But the new hire should find more than enough to do.\n\n• \n• \n
Sharon Headley saw a gun, then a flash of white. She ducked down as the gunman fired again and again into the Nissan Sentra.When the shooting was over, Headley raised her head and called to her friend, Chantal Palmer, who was in the driver’s seat.\n\t\n“Let’s go! Let’s go! Drive!” she urged Palmer.But Palmer, 20, didn’t answer. Headley, who was in the front passenger seat, was horrified as her friend instead slumped over and fell into her lap. She was covered in blood.Headley, 29, testified in Suffolk Superior Court Wednesday morning about the Dorchester shooting that killed Palmer — Headley’s childhood friend — 20-year-old Shakora Gaines, and Anthony Peoples, a 19-year-old who had joined the women the night of March 28, 2009, for what was supposed to be a night of dancing.All four were in Palmer’s Nissan leaving an after-hours party on Mt. Ida Road when a man in a white shirt fired nine shots into the sedan. Only Headley, a mother of three, survived. Sometimes calm, sometimes weeping, Headley testified for about an hour about the events that led up to a burst of violence that seemed to come out of nowhere.Keron Pierre, 29, is on trial on first-degree murder charges in the three killings. The .40-caliber handgun that was used to kill the young friends was never recovered, and there is no physical evidence tying Pierre to the crime. Pierre’s defense attorney, John Tardiff, has argued to the jury that Pierre is being falsely accused for a crime committed by another man who was with him at the party that night.Headley, who said she never saw the killer’s face, did not identify Pierre in court as the shooter. But she said the gunman was wearing a white tank top, a description that matches those of other eyewitnesses who said they saw Pierre wearing something similar.Headley, Gaines, and Palmer had driven to Boston from Brockton on March 28 to go dancing at Boston nightclubs. They picked up Peoples and later a friend of his. The group had heard of three after-hours house parties going on that night in Boston and decided to go to the one on Mt. Ida Road.Around 4 in the morning on March 29, the women decided to leave.They and Peoples left but realized they had left Peoples’s friend behind, so they turned back.The car was stopped at a stop sign when someone knocked on the passenger-side window and motioned at Peoples. It was a man who asked him what street in Boston he was from, a question that is often a precursor to violence — gang members in certain parts of the city will shoot at young men with no gang ties simply because they are from rival territory.Peoples answered, then told the man they were not looking for any trouble. The man left them alone.But the group was unnerved. As they approached the Mt. Ida house where the party had been, a group of four or five men walked directly in front of the car, forcing Palmer to step on the brakes to avoid hitting them.One of the men peered into the car and began trying to flirt with the women.“What’s good, ladies?” he asked. Headley testified that the women just looked at each other and said nothing.“They’re good,” Peoples told the man, then asked him to back away from the car.“What expletive? We’re strapped,” the man said, indicating that they had guns.Before Peoples and the women could react, a man wearing white began shooting at the car.When the shooting was over, Headley managed to get out of the car and hide behind a van. She made her way back into the house to get help, her clothes covered in blood. Later, police discovered two bullet holes in her jacket, but she was unhurt.During Headley’s testimony, she frequently referred to Palmer as “Dee Dee,” a nickname.Palmer’s father, Michael Palmer, sat in the front row of the courtroom, crying as he listened to Headley.“Hearing her called by that name, Dee Dee, it brings back memories,” Palmer said outside the courtroom after Headley finished her testimony.Dee Dee was the nickname her brother gave her when they were children.“He couldn’t say her real name,” Michael Palmer said.Chantal Palmer was boisterous, talkative, a little loud sometimes, and fun-loving.“She just loved life,” said her stepmother, Betty Palmer.A mother of a baby boy, Chantal Palmer had been working as a waitress at Old Country Buffet in Brockton and trying to finish nursing school at the time of her death, Michael Palmer said. Her son is now 6.\n\n• \n• \n
Election night 2010, Charles D. Baker — as he was known then — saw his gubernatorial hopes collapse as the returns came in from Democratic strongholds around the state: Boston, Worcester, Springfield, New Bedford, Fall River, Lawrence.The margins for Governor Deval Patrick in those and other blue-collar cities and liberal bastions were so huge that they wiped out any chance Baker could count on his own heavy vote totals in GOP-dominated enclaves across the state to give him a victory.\n\t\nIt was a crushing blow, enough to send almost any other candidate back to private life for good. But instead it sent Baker on a quest of extensive self-reflection. He wanted to figure out what he did wrong and how could he do it right. He sought out a diverse range of people who could offer hard assessments of his failure as a candidate.What he found — and, just important, what he corrected — led him to where he is now, four years later, staffing an administration and preparing for his Jan. 8 inauguration as the 72d governor of Massachusetts.His political makeover and how he applied it to his 2014 campaign probably offers the clearest picture yet of how Charlie Baker — as he likes to be known now — will approach the job of governor and the skills he will bring to it.How much the newly branded “Charlie” will be there for his four-year term will be critical to his success. There will be challenges to his patience (he is known not to suffer fools gladly, and will no doubt have to deal with a few). There will surely be strains on some of the relationships he built in the campaign, particularly if he sticks to his fiscally conservative leanings. Immigration, closing budget deficits, and welfare reform are but a few of the challenges to his newfound political skills.Partisan Democrats are treading lightly in the traditional postelection honeymoon period. But they are ready to lay some initial markers.“Some of Republican Charlie Baker’s early actions and appointments are a welcome change from the 2010 extremist, over-the-top Charlie and reflect the Charlie we saw in 2014,’’ said Matt Fenlon, executive director of the state Democratic Party. “However, it is important to note there have also been early indications to voters that they should be on the lookout to make sure this administration does not revert to the unpopular positions of 2010 Charlie.”Baker’s self-analysis that began just months after the campaign four years ago was difficult, at times painful, as friends, associates, and political analysts bluntly told him how poorly he performed, how narrow and limited his vision was, and what a miserable, angry image he projected.What he found bothered him deeply. His defeat and the harsh feedback were jarring for a man who for years was seen as the brilliant, bouncy boy wonder whom the moderate Republican establishment has been grooming to carry on the legacies and political coalitions of the Weld/Cellucci administrations.“I can’t tell you how many people who I have known told me, ‘I didn’t recognize who that guy was,’\u2009” Baker said in a recent interview. “That’s just plain disturbing.”The retooling for this year’s election took his candidacy directly to Democratic constituencies and heavily populated Democratic communities. The strategy was to win not a majority, but enough to undercut Democratic nominee Martha Coakley’s margins that could once again swamp him.Baker significantly changed his rhetoric and his tone. He made subtle but important shifts in positions designed to soften opposition on issues where he seemed intransigent. He met with the leaders of the state’s largest unions, walked city streets with friendly Democratic mayors, and spent time in minority neighborhoods where he was almost never seen in 2010.“He learned an awful lot from that loss,’’",

398,Jane the Virgin,"""By his own admission, John Terwilliger’s housekeeping standards were .\xa0.\xa0. relaxed. “If I ever made my bed, it was just to get my mother off my back,” he said. “I’ve always lived just clean enough to get by.”But that was the Terwilliger of last fall, before he started renting out a studio in Allston/Brighton through Airbnb, the popular, if controversial, online booking service.\n\t\nNow the 2013 Boston College graduate fluffs pillows. He defrosts the fridge. He paints. “I’m on a ladder touching up a brownish black stain,” he said when reached by phone on Monday. “If it was my room, I couldn’t care less, but I want it to look nice so people are happy.”Similar transformations are taking place throughout Boston and beyond, as the promise of relatively easy money is making innkeepers of people who never thought they’d be in the hospitality industry. Airbnb’s website currently lists nearly 3,500 properties for rent in the Boston area — a 63 percent increase since July 2013.\n\nSome of the lodging arrangements offered cost less than $50 per night and involve little more than a bed, a key, and zero conversation. Others offer entire homes, bed-and-breakfast-intensity chitchat, and prices that can top $800 per night. Aspiring innkeepers are everywhere, from Dorchester to Revere, Boston to Somerville, advertising “treetop views,” “steps to the T,” “cozy penthouses,” even “lovely puppies.”In Central Square, Kristina Mastropasqua, 31, a program assistant at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government by day, finds herself taking 30 pounds of dirty sheets and towels to her local laundromat every few weeks, linens for  out for $99 per night, plus a per-visit $25 cleaning fee.“I’ve essentially added a full-time job to my job,” she said.In the process, she and her partner have earned tens of thousands of dollars since they began hosting visitors in 2012. They’ve also learned about human behavior.“We meet so many great people,” she said. “But your house gets a good beating.”People flush strange things down the toilet, or try to. They bang luggage into walls. They stain towels with make-up. “Our remote control ended up in Singapore,” Mastropasqua said. (Its still there.)Jen Lawrence, a city planner who rents the pullout couch in her Somerville living room for $65 per night, spends her off hours shopping for local craft beer, chocolates, and cheese to share with guests, many foreign.“I feel I’ve become like an ambassador for Boston,” she said.\n\nAirbnb was founded in 2008, and from its San Francisco base it now operates in more than 34,000 cities, 190 countries, and claims over 160,000 listings. What started out as a way for tourists to travel cheaply has grown to include a small but growing number of business travelers, too.Concur, an expense-management company, reports that its clients spent about $1 million staying at Airbnb rentals in the second quarter of 2014.Considering that virtually anyone with an air mattress can become a host — the company does not routinely screen users — Airbnb is a major player in the “sharing economy.”But with success has come negative attention from municipalities that want to tax the lodging arrangements as they do hotels, from landlords with leases that prohibiting sublets, and from neighbors who don’t want strangers traipsing through buildings.In New York, state Attorney General Eric Schneiderman spent months fighting the company for its user data in an attempt to crack down on illegal hotels. (In May, the two sides reached an agreement; Airbnb turned over data, but not user names.)In Portland, Ore., Airbnb recently began collecting hotel tax, and is expected to do the same in San Francisco.With the site’s popularity growing in Massachusetts, the Executive Office of Health and Human Services recently opined in a memo that lodging of this type is subject to local licensure as a bed and breakfast For now, the Inspectional Services Department has issued a temporary policy not to issue citations to homeowners while an internal group works on recommendations. A city policy is expected this fall, and as yet, no per-bed fee rate has been set.Airbnb, which is reportedly valued at $10 billion, takes a 3 percent “host fee,” and charges guests a 6 percent to 12 percent fee for costs associated with running the site. A host renting a room for $100 keeps $97.In addition to advising prospective users to check local zoning laws and offering suggestions on how to shoot photos of rooms for rent (close the toilet lid), Airbnb provides free insurance that reimburses hosts for up to $1 million of property damage in the “rare case” when something goes wrong.Most rentals go smoothly, but not all. Earlier this summer, Barbara Bennison, a 66-year-old nurse who rents two bedrooms in her Southie condo — and last year earned so much, $23,000, that she dropped a shift — found herself acting more like a hotel security officer than a medical professional.\n\n“They were two young couples and they arrived around 5 p.m.,” she recalled. Over the course of a few hours, the guests drank rum, turned boisterous, and played beer pong on Bennison’s dining room table. “I told them they couldn’t stay.”She called a cab, provided the number of the nearby Westin, and kept one night’s rent. “They got pretty irate,” she said.But at a time when technology allows people on both sides of a transaction to rate each other (on Uber also, passengers judge the drivers, and drivers judge them back), Airbnb hosts don’t have to suffer quietly. The ratings they give guests are seen by future potential hosts.Bennison, who has all five-star reviews from guests, has never gone negative before, but she gave the couples a bad review. “That follows them,” she said.Despite the periodic gleeful Airbnb-gone-bad tabloid newspaper headlines — “Hookers turning Airbnb apartments into brothels,” the New York Post blared in April; “Airbnb renter returns to ‘overweight’ orgy,” it trumpeted in May — the reviews on Airbnb’s site often show humanity at its best.In Winthrop, the mother of a host picked up a guest who needed a lift to the $112 room. “Thank you, Shirley!” the renter wrote. In Charlestown, a woman who paid $150 for a bedroom during the Marathon raved about her hosts’ willingness to endure “running chat.” They “even came out and cheered during the race.”In Union Square, Monique Plante, 48, and her husband, Robert Caruso, 58, positively gush about the professors and international travelers they’ve met in the year they’ve been  in their craftsman-style home ($100 for a queen bed, a twin, and a Jacuzzi).But as lovely as it has been, it’s still work.“It’s like having houseguests,” Plante said, “constantly.”\n\n• \n• \n• \n• \n• \n""",

Supermodel Beverly Johnson is the latest woman to level accusations against Bill Cosby, alleging that Cosby drugged her in his home in the mid-’80s — accusations made in an article she wrote for \nJohnson, who was the first African-American model to appear on the cover of Vogue in 1974, said she visited Cosby at his Manhattan townhouse to audition for “The Cosby Show” when the alleged incident occurred. She said Cosby gave her a cappuccino to drink, and after she took a sip, she felt woozy.\n\t\n“When I took that drink, it was like night and day for me,” . “I went from rehearsing a scene with Bill Cosby to this man just drugged me. I have no idea what the drugs were, but I felt it in an instant and it was very intense.” Johnson, 56, writes in her  that Cosby put his hands around her waist and, realizing what was happening, she spoke up to Cosby, yelling and cursing at him — and that’s when Cosby allegedly took her outside and put her in a cab to leave.Johnson, 62,  who have come out against Cosby for giving her courage to share her story. More than a dozen women have accused the comedian of sexual assault.“You have to take action,” she told . “Bill Cosby took my power that day, and I took my power back today. Maybe it took 30 years, but I did.”She also told People that she has no plans to sue Cosby for any damages.Cosby, 77, has never been charged in connection with any sexual assault allegations. In 2005, Cosby settled a civil case filed by Andrea Constand, a former employee at Temple University. On Wednesday, a woman who accused Cosby of sexually assaulting her in the 1970s filed a defamation lawsuit against him, alleging he ‘‘publicly branded’’ her a liar through statements made by his lawyer and publicist. Tamara Green, 66, said in the lawsuit filed in federal court in Springfield (Cosby has a home in Shelburne Falls) that Cosby drugged and assaulted her when she was an aspiring model. Green first spoke publicly about the alleged attack in 2005. Green says after she did media interviews, Cosby’s lawyer and publicist made statements intended to expose her to public contempt and ridicule. The lawyer, Walter M. Phillips Jr., declined to comment. Messages left for the publicist, David Brokaw, weren’t immediately returned. Cosby is the lawsuit’s only defendant. 
FALL RIVER — The texts that Odin Lloyd sent minutes before he was fatally shot cannot be shown to the jury during the first-degree murder trial of former New England Patriot Aaron Hernandez, a judge ruled Friday, dealing a blow to prosecutors. They had argued that those texts would have shown Lloyd knew he was about to die — and who was going to kill him.\n\t\nProsecutors tried in vain to persuade Superior Court Judge E. Susan Garsh to admit the text messages from June 2013 as evidence, as well as their theory that Hernandez killed Lloyd because he worried that Lloyd knew too much about another crime Hernandez is charged with — a 2012 double murder in Boston.But Garsh said the texts did not suggest Lloyd feared for his life and that prosecutors had no credible basis for linking his killing with the fatal shootings of two men in Boston a year earlier.“It is clearly in the realm of speculation,” Garsh said at the Fall River Justice Center, where jury selection is to begin Jan. 9 in the trial of Hernandez, 24.The mother of Lloyd, a 27-year-old semi-pro football player from Dorchester, ran out of the courtroom weeping after Garsh ruled the text messages should be withheld.Minutes before he was shot in the early morning hours of June 17, 2013, Lloyd texted his sister: “U saw who I was with ... NFL ... Just so U know.”The timing of those texts, sent at the same time Hernandez and Lloyd were in a car pulling into the industrial park where Lloyd was shot to death, reveal a frightened man trying to warn his sister, Bristol Assistant District Attorney William McCauley argued.But Garsh questioned whether the texts could just as easily have been Lloyd bragging about his friendship with Hernandez. Lloyd’s sister responded to one of the texts: “LOL,” or laughing out loud.Garsh rejected the prosecution’s argument that Lloyd’s text was a “dying declaration.”\nProsecutors “do not provide a basis to infer that he was under the belief of imminent death,” she said.While the prosecution’s case has been weakened, the extent won’t be known until the trial, legal observers said.“It’s a good day for the defense,” said Michael Doolin, a former Suffolk prosecutor who is now a Boston defense attorney and is not associated with the case. “The defense seems to have won a victory. It narrows the scope of what the government can present.”Bristol prosecutors will still be able to present surveillance footage of Hernandez at his North Attleborough home holding a gun the night Lloyd was killed. They said they also have footage of the car Hernandez was driving leaving the industrial park where Lloyd was shot, then returning to Hernandez’s home minutes after the killing.The .45 caliber handgun that was used to kill Lloyd has never been recovered, but state troopers found a .22 caliber firearm in the woods near the scene of the crime that prosecutors said was discarded by one of Hernandez’s associates. Prosecutors have filed motions saying they want to test DNA found in the car, biological material from Lloyd’s hand, and the .22 caliber gun.Garsh allowed the discovered gun into evidence, but agreed with defense attorneys that other weapons connected to Hernandez, including a rifle, should not be admitted because they have no direct bearing on the case.When McCauley tried to argue that a 2009 photo of Hernandez holding what appeared to be a .45 caliber gun posted on the celebrity gossip site TMZ should be allowed into evidence, Garsh mildly rebuked him.“It’s just a piling on with respect to evidence of gun” possession, Garsh said. Alexander Bradley, a former friend who has accused Hernandez of shooting him in the face a few months before Lloyd was killed, is expected to testify against him. Bradley allegedly saw a gun that resembled a .45 caliber in Hernandez’s possession.But Garsh said prosecutors cannot ask Bradley about his claim that Hernandez shot him in the face following an argument after they left a club in Florida. McCauley had argued that the shooting was similar to the shooting of Lloyd and the two men in Boston in 2012 — Lloyd was shot a night after he and Hernandez hung out at a club in Boston. The two Boston victims, Safiro Furtado, 28, and Daniel Abreu, 29, were shot after one of them accidentally bumped into Hernandez at a club in the Theatre District, causing him to spill his drink, Suffolk prosecutors have said. Furtado and Abreu did not know Hernandez, who has pleaded not guilty in their killings.“We’re talking about three people getting killed and a fourth getting shot in 11 months,” McCauley said. “I don’t think it’s fair to say these things aren’t relevant.”McCauley argued that a text from Hernandez to his fiancée the night he hung out with Lloyd showed he was worried about what his friend knew — he had shown Lloyd the “other spot,” meaning the club where he encountered the two men in the Suffolk case, the prosecutor said.Lloyd knew too much, McCauley said.“This is just a fantasy,” retorted James Sultan, one of Hernandez’s lawyers.Garsh agreed that the connections prosecutors were trying to make were tenuous and could be prejudicial to a jury.Garsh’s rulings may have stripped the prosecutors of being able to offer the jury a powerful motive for Lloyd’s killing, said Doolin, the Boston lawyer.“Jurors expect some sort of motive, some reason why this happened, and if the government doesn’t have a clear motive, it certainly weakens the case,” Doolin said. “It’s not legally necessary for the government to present motive, but it’s certainly something the jury looks for.”\n
Arlington Police Chief Fred Ryan has been selected to lead the MBTA police force, though members of the board that would make the hire want more limits on the contract before approving the appointment.“I’m honored to have been offered the job and I look forward to ironing out the details,” Ryan said on Friday.\n\t\nThe Arlington native would take over for Paul MacMillan, who was appointed chief almost seven years ago and has spent 31 years in the department. MacMillan retired on Nov. 1.Ryan was appointed chief of the Arlington police in 1999.Chairman John Jenkins raised concerns about the length of the contract offer that MBTA General Manager Beverly Scott described to the state transportation board on Thursday, but told the News Service he had no qualms with the selection of Ryan, describing him as an “outstanding candidate.”The discussion on Thursday about upcoming contract negotiations could have been held in a closed-door executive session, but the agenda did not provide for an executive session, which requires advance notice.“This discussion is public and available to the candidate,” advised general counsel Paige Scott Reed midway into the back-and-forth.An MBTA spokesman said documents related to the appointment would be made public after they are voted on. The board decided to come to agreement on the contract offer at an executive session on Tuesday afternoon.Scott said the agreement would be for five years with a salary of $188,000, which is slightly more than MacMillan made and about $18,000 more than Ryan’s salary in Arlington.“I think five years is a long time,” said Jenkins, suggesting three years and asserting the board’s authority over the hire. He said, “This is our hire. This is not the general manager’s hire.”Scott told reporters after the meeting that she appreciated Ryan’s approach to community policing, diversity in the department, “ethical decision-making” and said he would bring a balanced approach toward contract negotiations. Referring to Arlington, Scott said he had taken over for a “department that had been troubled.”“We’re going to grab him,” Scott said. She said the MBTA has some “very seasoned folks” who can handle operations, and she was looking for a leader.Donna Scott, the assistant director of staffing, said the MBTA received 94 applications for the post overseeing a staff of 266 sworn police officers and a budget of just under $19 million. Out of all those who initially sought the job, 56 applicants met the minimum requirements, and 22 candidates participated in a phone interview, including six internal candidates, Donna Scott said.Ryan was selected over Grayling Williams, a chief inspector in the Pennsylvania attorney general’s office, and Andrew Olson, a deputy chief of the Metro Transit police in Minneapolis, Minn., according to the assistant director of staffing.Kenneth Green is the MBTA’s acting police chief, and Beverly Scott said the MBTA is looking for a Feb. 1 start date.Ryan had been a finalist for chief of police in Cambridge in 2007. That job went to Robert Haas, former secretary of public safety in the Romney administration.Donna Scott said that Williams is a black man, while Ryan and Olson are white men. She said when the field was narrowed to six the candidates included four white men, one black man and one black woman.
Mark Wahlberg defended his request for a pardon in a 1988 assault Friday, telling the “Today” show that he turned his life around after a behind-bars reckoning with his teenage transgressions.The actor and former hiphop star, now 43, spoke about the Massachusetts pardon application   about his upcoming film, “The Gambler.”\n\t\n“Of course, everybody has an opinion and is entitled to it, whether I’m deserving of it or not,” Wahlberg said. “But from the day I woke up in prison and realized the mistakes that I had made and the pain that I had caused people, I committed to turning my life around.”Wahlberg served 45 days in jail as a teen for hitting a man over the head with a wooden stick while trying to steal alcohol from a convenience store in Dorchester and later punching another man while attempting to avoid the police. He acknowledged in the application for pardon that he was high on marijuana and narcotics at the time.“People have said because of my celebrity and my success, I’m basically waving that magic wand, but it’s not about that. It’s never been about that,” Wahlberg said. “I’ve been committed to turning my life around and becoming a productive person in the community.”\n\nVisit NBCNews.com for , , and “Today” show co-host Matt Lauer asked Wahlberg about speculation that he wanted to apply to be a police officer or acquire liquor licenses for his two Wahlburgers restaurants, neither of which is possible with a felony conviction on his record.Wahlberg said he had not applied to be on the police force in Los Angeles and simply acknowledged that he had two restaurants.“I’m not proud of what I’ve done, I’m just committed to making sure that I’ve paid for my mistakes and I hopefully help kids avoid making those mistakes,” Wahlberg said, referring to his charity work, which includes the Mark Wahlberg Youth Foundation, which is committed to helping at-risk inner-city kids.Wahlberg also discussed the challenges he faced in leaving the gang he had been involved with in the 1980s.“I still had to go to prison, so not being in the gang anymore left me alone,” he said. “And going back to the community and still living in the neighborhood and having to go to the train station every day and pass those guys was a tough thing to do.”Wahlberg said he has since worked to help young people avoid the kind of mistakes he made.“This has been 27 years in the works, and if I’m not granted the pardon, it will not change my commitment to working in the communities,” Wahlberg said.\n\n• \n• \n• \n• \n• \n• \n\n\n
Governor-elect Charlie Baker has named Ronald L. Walker II the state’s next secretary of labor, making Walker the first person of color to join the Cabinet.Walker, 53, is also a Democrat, according to Baker’s spokesman, making him the fourth appointment across the aisle for the incoming Republican governor.\n\t\nWalker is chairman of the board of The BASE, a Roxbury mentoring center offering sports and academic opportunities to black and Latino youths. Baker often featured The BASE during his campaign for governor, rallying supporters there and highlighting its founder, Robert Lewis Jr., as one of his key supporters from the black community.Lewis said on Friday that Walker provides an ideal example for the young people he guides at The BASE. On Friday, when he told the young people at the center about Walker’s appointment, they applauded, he said. “Besides all the accolades, he’s a go-getter. He’s a manager. He’s strategic. He’s a bridge-builder,” Lewis said. “He’s one of the few presidents or black leaders of significance in the private sector and he grew up in the ’hood.”Walker was a cofounder of Next Street, a merchant bank that offers capital to entrepreneurs in urban markets. He is also a director of Emerson College, and he previously held executive posts at Sovereign Bank and Fleet Financial Group. Two years ago, at Walker’s wedding.  “Ron’s experience will serve him well as he takes on the job of connecting our administration’s job training and workforce development services with employers, ensuring they expand and grow here,” Baker said in a statement. “I look forward to Ron bringing the new, innovative approach he took in his role at Next Street to this important post, and I am thrilled to have him on board,” Baker added. “He has worked to earn incredible success over his career and he will be invaluable to our efforts in bridging the gap between work and education to make Massachusetts great everywhere.”Walker is also a former chairman of the board of the Roxbury Comprehensive Community Health Center, a neighborhood mainstay that was was abruptly shuttered last year when it was unable to pay its bills. The center was placed in receivership and forced to relinquish its federal grants and its state license from the Department of Public Health.Baker spokesman Tim Buckley said that Walker left the board well before the issues arose.  Walker did not respond to requests for comment. But he said in a statement that he was honored to join the administration and humbled by the opportunity to serve the people of the Commonwealth.“I share the governor-elect’s emphasis on connecting education to work, his commitment to workforce development, and look forward to helping carry out his mission to make Massachusetts a great place to live and work in every region of the Commonwealth,” Walker’s statement said. Baker, a Republican who had been unsuccessful in his 2010 campaign for governor, made a point this year of reaching out to communities of color and other urban wards he was not expected to win — an effort that resulted in minimizing his losses and forging new alliances.\n
Everyone seems to be blaming Partners HealthCare for driving up medical costs. The mammoth organization is trying to change that. Too bad it’s by squeezing the paychecks of workers on the bottom rung.In negotiating a new union contract at North Shore Medical Center in Lynn, the powerful hospital network is proposing to keep starting pay for housekeepers, secretaries, and other low-skilled employees at $10.25 an hour, with a raise of 3 percent for each of the next two years. A full-time worker would make about $20,000 annually.\n\t\nThat sounds fair enough until you realize the minimum wage in Massachusetts will go up to $9 an hour next month, $10 in 2016, and $11 by 2017. Partners is skating above what is legally mandated — and well below some of its competitors.At the Lynn Community Health Center, the lowest-skilled union workers, such as receptionists and maintenance staff, start at $13 an hour under a contract that took effect in October. The previous minimum wage was $11.38. That’s not a typo. You indeed just read that Lynn Community Health Center, where about half the 550 employees are unionized, pays better than an institution owned by the richest health care system in the state, and one built partly by charging the highest prices around. Perhaps that’s how the rich stay rich — by nickel-and-diming everyone else.Union workers at the Lynn center, which provides primary care and other outpatient services, are represented by 1199SEIU. That’s the same local negotiating the agreement at North Shore Medical. So why is the Lynn health center paying its workers so well?“It felt like the right thing to do,” said deputy director Bob Dempkowski. “This is recruitment and retention for us. There are no simple jobs these days. Everybody in the place is important to the patient experience.”The contract was structured so that the lowest-wage workers get the biggest bump in the first year, followed by modest raises the next two years. Not only that, but employees who have been there for 10 years and whose pay had not reached $15 an hour, were immediately moved up to that level. That figure is considered a living wage and has become the new standard popularized by striking workers in the fast-food industry.So consider what would happen if Miriam Minaya, a 48-year-old housekeeper at North Shore Medical, worked at the Lynn center instead. She makes $11.54 an hour at the Partners hospital, up from $9 an hour when she started in 2005. That’s progress, but if she had a job across town, she’d soon be making $15 an hour.The difference is not chump change. Rather it’s a matter of being able to put food on her table every night and paying the rent on time.Now, Partners will hem and haw, and tell us each hospital negotiates its own contracts.Partners is made up of 10 hospitals, including Brigham and Women’s and Massachusetts General hospitals in Boston. The organization has been under scrutiny over a controversial settlement pending before a judge that would allow Partners to add three hospitals. While North Shore may be part of a network with deep pockets — $6.9 billion in net assets — its Lynn outpost is bleeding, with an operating loss of $17 million for the first nine months of its fiscal year. Savings have to come from somewhere.“How can they say the hospital has no money?” Minaya said. “What about the employees? I don’t understand. I know the hospital has money. They can’t say they are losing. Partners is a big company.”Partners insists it is doing right by many employees.At North Shore Medical, 70 percent of its unionized workers already earn more than $13 an hour, and the average hourly wage is $14.86. In addition, there are plenty of benefits, from health insurance to a pension.That’s all good — but let’s stay on point here. What is Partners doing for its workers at the entry level?Discussions began in September, and the next bargaining session is scheduled for Monday. According to 1199SEIU, Partners is being represented by a team of lawyers led by Diane Patrick, the co-managing partner of Ropes & Gray’s Boston office and the wife of Governor Deval Patrick. Diane Patrick did not respond to requests for comment.A year ago, Boston Mayor Tom Menino, in the waning days of his administration, delivered a parting shot at Partners when the company decided to consolidate about 4,500 back office workers in Somerville rather than in Roxbury.“The social conscience has gone out of Partners,” he said at the time. “This is all about their bottom line.”At the time, I disagreed with Menino. I  for keeping the jobs in the region rather than moving them out of state.But on the subject of how Partners treats its lowest-wage workers, I do think the organization has lost its way. Our late mayor was right.\n\n• \n• \n• \n• \n• \n• \n
It was Sean Dwyer’s dream to run his own hair salon, and he had finally done it, opening Clover City Unisex Barbershop on Adams Street in Dorchester this year, friends and family said.“He was so proud of his business. He was painting and scrubbing and cleaning and polishing it every day,” said Kathleen Joyce, 77, who lives next door and said she spoke to Dwyer nearly every day.\n\t\nHe was stabbed to death Friday around 6:20 p.m. near the barbershop at 671 Adams St. that he loved so much, authorities said. Police have not yet released his name, but a man who identified himself as Dwyer’s father gave his name, and friends confirmed it. A police spokeswoman said no arrests have been made.“I saw him. .\xa0.\xa0. He was giving a haircut. He waved to me,” said Joyce, who walked past the shop’s windows Friday evening. “A half hour later, he was sprawled out on the street dead with a sheet thrown over him.”On Saturday morning, the door to the barbershop was filled with bouquets, with messages addressed to “Shizz.” Friends and family laid flowers, knelt to pray, and crossed themselves in front of the darkened window.Dwyer’s father, who declined to give his name, stood crying in front of the barbershop, peering in the windows for a quiet moment Saturday morning.The lights were off except for a string of Christmas lights wrapped around a short tree sitting on a counter.“I don’t know what I’m looking for,” the man murmured.The man said his son was a “giver” who had opened the shop not even a year ago.“It was his dream, he fulfilled it,” he said. “Not for very long.”Neighbors said Dwyer was always waving to people passing by on the street, and his landlord said he began renting the storefront about two years ago. He spent a long time fixing it up before opening up in the last few months, neighbors and friends said. While Dwyer’s father stood outside the shop, a woman ran up to him and told him how much her young son loved Dwyer, then gave him a hug.“Some really bad person did this to him,” said Matthew Albert, 40, who lives in Quincy and said he was Dwyer’s best friend. He came to the shop with family, and he prayed for a long time at the window. “He was a man of the world, and he had the biggest heart in the whole world.”Dwyer had recently moved to Watertown, and he had a longtime girlfriend with a 12-year-old daughter. Albert said Dwyer was like a father to the girl.“He took her to camp; he drove her to school every day,” he said.Dwyer had been sober for 2½ years, Albert said, and had helped Albert get sober, too.“He said, ‘You got three beautiful children. You’re getting older, Matthew. You better smarten up,’ ” Albert said. “I’ll always be grateful .\xa0.\xa0. I’ll always consider him my brother.”The slaying was the 49th homicide in Boston in 2014, compared with 39 at this time last year, authorities said.
After weeks of tense meetings and protests by neighbors, city officials have decided they are likely to scrap their leading plan to house hundreds of homeless people who have remained in limbo since Mayor Martin J. Walsh ordered the bridge to their Long Island shelter closed in October.City officials on Friday said they’re now considering a new location in a city building with fewer neighbors, but they declined to say where.\n\t\nThe decision, which homeless advocates say raises new concerns about the city’s long-term plans, comes after city officials this week also rejected a separate site in Roxbury to house many of the recovery programs that had been based on the island in Boston Harbor. The officials said the new homeless shelter, which would house at least 450 men and women displaced from Long Island, could be ready earlier than the modular buildings they had initially proposed to build this January on a city lot on Frontage Road in the South End. But they wouldn’t say when that might happen.The advantage of the new plan, they said, is that they would only have to renovate the building and not construct a new one.“We continue to explore any option that will ensure a safe, stable shelter, as quickly as possible,” said Kate Norton, a spokeswoman for the mayor.She called the decision to nix the Frontage Road site “almost certain,” but she said the plan depends on whether the city can change the zoning of the new building and whether it is economically feasible to get it ready this winter.“The mayor is pushing hard to make this happen,” she said. She said she expects the city to announce the new location next week. City officials said there has been intense pushback from neighborhood groups in the South End and others who didn’t want to see an infusion of more homeless into their community. They also considered concerns that a shelter on Frontage Road would interfere with a proposal by the family of Robert Kraft to build a soccer stadium for the New England Revolution in the same area. The South End is already home to hundreds of homeless people who stay at the Pine Street Inn, on the other side of Interstate 93 from the Frontage Road city lot. The city used to run a methadone clinic on the property.But the booming neighborhood in recent years has also become home to hundreds of high-end condominiums and a new Whole Foods.“In all of the plans we’ve put forth so far, we’ve yet to find a strong voice of support,” Norton said. “But we’re confident we won’t run into the same issues that we’ve had with the new option.”Those who opposed the Frontage Road plan were happy to hear of the administration’s changing plan but are worried the new location might also be in the South End.“It seems like the mayor has made a smart decision, because that location was fraught with problems,” said Liz Cahill, co-executive of the Old Dover Neighborhood Association in the South End.She and other neighbors met with Walsh and other high-ranking officials last week to express their concerns. She worries her neighborhood is becoming a “dumping ground for Boston’s homeless.”“But until we know what that location is, and they speak to us and communicate with us, I can’t say whether this is good news,” Cahill said.Another neighbor, Northeastern University professor James Alan Fox, president of the Union Park Neighborhood Association, said he was “relieved that they’re not going to put 450 homeless people in our neighborhood.”When city officials announced their plans last month for housing the homeless, they said they had been also considering a renovated Boston Redevelopment Authority building near the Black Falcon Cruise Terminal in South Boston, but the space, once used to repair ships, wouldn’t be available until August. They also had considered another South Boston spot in a slightly smaller Massachusetts Port Authority building, which has been used as a garage and for container fumigation. But that space lacks bathrooms and showers and would have to be vacated by June.City officials said the Frontage Road site had a number of advantages, including that it’s on city-owned land, doesn’t abut any residential buildings, and is secured by fences. They estimated it would cost about $250,000 to build and that it would have been easy to service with buses.“It’s the best option right now,” said Jerome Smith, the city’s chief of civic engagement, last month.Advocates for the homeless said they’re concerned that the decision could lead to even longer stays for the displaced at the city’s improvised shelters, where hundreds of men and women are now sleeping in cramped conditions on cots and floor mats.They said they hope the city’s new plan is better than its proposal to house more than 200 recovering addicts from shuttered programs on Long Island at the Radius Specialty Hospital in Roxbury, which recently closed. City officials eliminated that proposal this week after a backlash from neighbors. “I’m appalled and disappointed that it has already taken this long,” said Michael Kane, executive director of the Mass Alliance of HUD Tenants and a member of the Boston Homeless Solidarity Committee. “The governor and mayor should be treating this as the emergency that it has been since day one.”  \nKaren LaFrazia, executive director of the St. Francis House, where 25 women from Long Island are sleeping on cots in their atrium and dining room, said she hopes the new location means the homeless will live in better conditions soon.She noted the city will soon be struggling to cope with its annual winter surge, when more beds are needed. “I’m very concerned,” she said. “I don’t see a plan to deal with this.”Among those struggling since Long Island closed is Cleve Rae, a 58-year-old unemployed software developer, who has been living with 250 men packed into the South End Fitness Center, where they have just two toilets.He blamed the city for not sharing more information with the community about its plans.“The conditions we’re living in is an outrage,” he said. “The city says this is high on their priority list, but it seems to us that they’re not really doing anything.”\n:• \n• \n• \n\n
State Police arrested 23 people participating in a protest that drew about 1,000 to downtown Boston on Saturday afternoon, said Colonel Timothy P. Alben, superintendent of the State Police. The 4½-half-hour demonstration was the latest in a series of more than a dozen across Greater Boston that began two days before Thanksgiving, following the decision of a grand jury in Ferguson, Mo., not to indict a white police officer who shot and killed an unarmed black teenager.\n\t\nDemonstrators crowded the steps of the State House and spread onto Boston Common shortly past noon to call for the end of police brutality that they said routinely targets minorities around the country, and to protest incidents such as those in Ferguson and in Staten Island, N.Y., in which white police officers killed unarmed black men. “We’re here today not only to seek solutions for Eric Garner and Michael Brown, but because this is an issue we see here in Boston,” said Brandi Artez, 28, referring to the men killed in those two cases.Most of Saturday’s arrests occurred in front of the Suffolk County Jail on Nashua Street after demonstrators tried to shove past a line of troopers and into Leverett Circle, Alben said in a phone interview Saturday evening.“They tried to push our people back and breach a line that we set,” Alben said. “They were pushing toward .\xa0.\xa0. a line we had established across Nashua Street, so that traffic wouldn’t be impeded in the circle.” Alben said that his troopers worked collaboratively with Boston police to manage the protest, and that most of the demonstrators were peaceful and respectful. However, he said, the officers “made it very clear that blocking interstate highways .\xa0.\xa0.  was off limits.\n“Anybody that got arrested today, it was because they wanted to be arrested. It certainly wasn’t because the police wanted to arrest them,” he said. The crowd outside the jail appeared to become angry when some State Police brandished batons. One demonstrator called upon others to push the line of troopers backward. Troopers returned the protesters’",

530,Norma,"""Norman Bridwell, a soft-spoken illustrator whose impromptu story about a girl and her puppy marked the unlikely birth of the supersized franchise Clifford the Big Red Dog, has died at 86.Bridwell, who lived for decades in a house with a bright red door on Martha’s Vineyard off Cape Cod in Massachusetts, died Friday at Martha’s Vineyard Hospital, where he had been for about three weeks after a fall at home in Edgartown, his wife, Norma, said.\n\t\nHe suffered from several ailments, including a recurrence of prostate cancer, she said. He passed peacefully with family members at his bedside, she said.Starting in 1963 with ‘‘Clifford, the Big Red Dog,’’ Bridwell wrote and illustrated more than 40 Clifford books, from ‘‘Clifford and the Grouchy Neighbors’’ to ‘‘Clifford Goes to Hollywood.’’ More than 120 million copies have sold worldwide, along with cartoons, a feature film, a musical, stuffed animals, key chains, posters and stickers. Images of Clifford have appeared everywhere from museums to the White House.‘‘A lot of people were Clifford fans and that makes them Norman fans, too,’’ said his wife of 56 years.Clifford became standard nighttime reading for countless families and a money machine for publisher Scholastic Inc. Spinoffs include cartoons with John Ritter as the voice of Clifford and future ‘‘Hunger Games’’ novelist Suzanne Collins among the script writers.Scholastic, which became a top children’s publisher thanks in part to Clifford, installed bright red cushions on the chairs in the corporate headquarters’ auditorium in New York. Scholastic had been in business for decades before Clifford, but the series’ success inspired the publisher to look for other stories with brand appeal, including ‘‘Goosebumps,’’ ‘The Magic School Bus’’ and ‘‘I Spy.’’Bridwell had completed two more Clifford books to be released next year, Scholastic said in a statement.In his pre-Clifford life, Bridwell was a filmstrip and slide illustrator, trying to break into children’s publishing to support his family. His work had been rejected all over New York when an editor at Harper & Row (now HarperCollins) suggested he try writing a story to go with a picture he had submitted of a child and her horse-sized dog. Bridwell’s idea: Thanks to the girl’s affection, a puppy —the runt of the litter — grows into a klutzy but good-hearted behemoth, as big as the lighthouses on the author’s imaginary ‘‘Birdwell Island.’’ A nearby paint container inspired Bridwell to color Clifford fire engine red.Bridwell had sketched a bloodhound because he wanted one while growing up and he named the girl Emily Elizabeth, after his daughter. He planned to call the dog ‘‘Tiny,’’ but his wife, Norma, suggested ‘‘Clifford,’’ the name of an imaginary friend she had as a child. Bridwell spent a weekend working up a story. Several publishers turned the book down before editor Beatrice de Regniers of Scholastic’s ‘‘Lucky Book Club’’ saw Clifford’s potential.‘‘I said to my wife, ‘Now don’t count on there being any more. This one is just a fluke. I don’t know if there will ever be another one,’’ Bridwell told The Associated Press in 2012.Bridwell achieved mainstream success without mainstream distribution. Scholastic offered the first Clifford story through book clubs and school fairs (Clifford wasn’t available in stores until the 1980s) and it sold well enough that Scholastic published a second, non-Clifford book by Bridwell, ‘‘The Witch Next Door.’’ Over the years, Bridwell added such ‘‘Clifford’’ sidekicks as the purple poodle Cleo, the three-legged training dog KC and Emily Elizabeth’s cranky schoolmate, Jetta. Bridwell’s name was a ringer for Norman Rockwell’s and Birdwell’s books were also a comforting portrait of stability and innocence. But he did work in social commentary, such as including children of different racial and ethnic backgrounds.‘‘I visited a school in Washington state and some kid said, ‘Why do you have these black people in the book?’’ Bridwell told The Associated Press in a 2011 interview. ‘‘I said that we wanted to have a little mix of races and nationalities and not just a purely lily white town.’’Bridwell said he came up with ideas for Clifford by watching other dogs. Clifford would often get himself in trouble, scattering garbage on the lawn or crushing a fence, then redeem himself as only a big dog could, whether saving a drowning child or gently gripping a stranded car between his teeth and carrying it to the nearest garage. Bridwell believed Clifford’s imperfections were part of his appeal, making kids more forgiving of their own mistakes. While he denied that Clifford was based on himself, Norma Bridwell disagreed.‘‘He’s never been able to recognize that,’’ she told the AP. ‘‘Clifford tries to do the right thing, Norman tries to do right the thing, and he makes a mess of it. But he’s the most lovable grown-up man. He’s just a nice guy.’’‘‘Im not really all that nice,’’ the author responded, ‘‘but I try to be.’’Bridwell was born in Kokomo, Indiana, in 1928. He was not a star in art or writing classes, but his mechanical skills were so much worse that a high school shop teacher suggested he stick to drawing. After graduation, he attended the John Herron Art Institute in Indianapolis, then moved to New York and studied at Cooper Union. Bridwell spent much of the 1950s as a commercial artist.In addition to his wife and daughter, Bridwell is survived by a son, Timothy, and three grandchildren. The family planned a private service with a public celebration of his life and work to come later, likely over the summer, his wife said.____\n.""",

880,Daniel F. Conley,"“But those who have protested the killings of Eric Garner, Michael Brown and others bear no responsibility for the twisted mind and crimes of Mr.\u2009Ismaaiyl Brinsley, who committed suicide after killing the two officers. On the contrary: It is in the long-term interest of the police, as well as of the communities they serve, to shape reforms that might reduce the incidence of police violence while still valuing officers’ safety and fighting crime. As Eric Adams, Brooklyn borough president and a former police captain, told the Times, ‘Calling for reform is not a call for harm of police officers.’ ”",
881,Daniel F. Conley,"“But when it comes to outrage over killings of the police, the standard is different. Ismaaiyl Brinsley began his rampage by shooting his girlfriend – an act of both black-on-black crime and domestic violence. On Saturday, Officers Liu and Ramos were almost certainly joined in death by some tragic number of black people who were shot down by their neighbors in the street. The killings of Officers Liu and Ramos prompt national comment. The killings of black civilians do not. When it is convenient to award qualitative value to murder, we do so. When it isn’t, we do not. We are outraged by violence done to police, because it is violence done to all of us as a society. In the same measure, we look away from violence done by the police, because the police are not the true agents of the violence. We are.”",

Rather, we’re shaking off the last ill effects of the recession and housing bust, which is allowing households to shop and companies to hire. The last six months of exceptionally speedy growth are partly just a product of the economy making up for lost time. Remember, GDP shrank at a 2.1 percent rate last winter as freak snow storms blanketed the South and the cold kept us all huddling inside.

He defrosts the fridge. He paints. “I’m on a ladder touching up a brownish black stain,” he said when reached by phone on Monday. “If it was my room, I couldn’t care less, but I want it to look nice so people are happy.”Similar transformations are taking place throughout Boston and beyond, as the promise of relatively easy money is making innkeepers of people who never thought they’d be in the hospitality industry. Airbnb’s website currently lists nearly 3,500 properties for rent in the Boston area — a 63 percent increase since July 2013.\n\nSome of the lodging arrangements offered cost less than $50 per night and involve little more than a bed, a key, and zero conversation. Others offer entire homes, bed-and-breakfast-intensity chitchat, and prices that can top $800 per night. Aspiring innkeepers are everywhere, from Dorchester to Revere, Boston to Somerville, advertising “treetop views,” “steps to the T,” “cozy penthouses,” even “lovely puppies.”In Central Square, Kristina Mastropasqua, 31, a program assistant at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government by day, finds herself taking 30 pounds of dirty sheets and towels to her local laundromat every few weeks, linens for  out for $99 per night, plus a per-visit $25 cleaning fee.“I’ve essentially added a full-time job to my job,” she said.\n\t\nIn the process, she and her partner have earned tens of thousands of dollars since they began hosting visitors in 2012. They’ve also learned about human behavior.“We meet so many great people,” she said. “But your house gets a good beating.”People flush strange things down the toilet, or try to. They bang luggage into walls. They stain towels with make-up. “Our remote control ended up in Singapore,” Mastropasqua said. (Its still there.)Jen Lawrence, a city planner who rents the pullout couch in her Somerville living room for $65 per night, spends her off hours shopping for local craft beer, chocolates, and cheese to share with guests, many foreign.“I feel I’ve become like an ambassador for Boston,” she said.\n\nAirbnb was founded in 2008, and from its San Francisco base it now operates in more than 34,000 cities, 190 countries, and claims over 160,000 listings. What started out as a way for tourists to travel cheaply has grown to include a small but growing number of business travelers, too.Concur, an expense-management company, reports that its clients spent about $1 million staying at Airbnb rentals in the second quarter of 2014.Considering that virtually anyone with an air mattress can become a host — the company does not routinely screen users — Airbnb is a major player in the “sharing economy.”But with success has come negative attention from municipalities that want to tax the lodging arrangements as they do hotels, from landlords with leases that prohibiting sublets, and from neighbors who don’t want strangers traipsing through buildings.In New York, state Attorney General Eric Schneiderman spent months fighting the company for its user data in an attempt to crack down on illegal hotels. (In May, the two sides reached an agreement; Airbnb turned over data, but not user names.)In Portland, Ore., Airbnb recently began collecting hotel tax, and is expected to do the same in San Francisco.With the site’s popularity growing in Massachusetts, the Executive Office of Health and Human Services recently opined in a memo that lodging of this type is subject to local licensure as a bed and breakfast For now, the Inspectional Services Department has issued a temporary policy not to issue citations to homeowners while an internal group works on recommendations. A city policy is expected this fall, and as yet, no per-bed fee rate has been set.Airbnb, which is reportedly valued at $10 billion, takes a 3 percent “host fee,” and charges guests a 6 percent to 12 percent fee for costs associated with running the site. A host renting a room for $100 keeps $97.In addition to advising prospective users to check local zoning laws and offering suggestions on how to shoot photos of rooms for rent (close the toilet lid), Airbnb provides free insurance that reimburses hosts for up to $1 million of property damage in the “rare case” when something goes wrong.Most rentals go smoothly, but not all. Earlier this summer, Barbara Bennison, a 66-year-old nurse who rents two bedrooms in her Southie condo — and last year earned so much, $23,000, that she dropped a shift — found herself acting more like a hotel security officer than a medical professional.\n\n“They were two young couples and they arrived around 5 p.m.,” she recalled. Over the course of a few hours, the guests drank rum, turned boisterous, and played beer pong on Bennison’s dining room table. “I told them they couldn’t stay.”She called a cab, provided the number of the nearby Westin, and kept one night’s rent. “They got pretty irate,” she said.But at a time when technology allows people on both sides of a transaction to rate each other (on Uber also, passengers judge the drivers, and drivers judge them back), Airbnb hosts don’t have to suffer quietly. The ratings they give guests are seen by future potential hosts.Bennison, who has all five-star reviews from guests, has never gone negative before, but she gave the couples a bad review. “That follows them,” she said.Despite the periodic gleeful Airbnb-gone-bad tabloid newspaper headlines — “Hookers turning Airbnb apartments into brothels,” the New York Post blared in April; “Airbnb renter returns to ‘overweight’ orgy,” it trumpeted in May — the reviews on Airbnb’s site often show humanity at its best.In Winthrop, the mother of a host picked up a guest who needed a lift to the $112 room. “Thank you, Shirley!” the renter wrote. In Charlestown, a woman who paid $150 for a bedroom during the Marathon raved about her hosts’ willingness to endure “running chat.” They “even came out and cheered during the race.”In Union Square, Monique Plante, 48, and her husband, Robert Caruso, 58, positively gush about the professors and international travelers they’ve met in the year they’ve been  in their craftsman-style home ($100 for a queen bed, a twin, and a Jacuzzi).But as lovely as it has been, it’s still work.“It’s like having houseguests,” Plante said, “constantly.”\n\n• \n• \n• \n• \n• \n""",

Boston’s new mayor, Martin J. Walsh, has repeatedly promised that the city’s building boom would continue under his administration, even as he vowed a top-to-bottom overhaul of its chief planning agency.But three months into his term, the pipeline of major new proposals has slowed to a trickle. Some of the lawyers, developers, and neighborhood activists who drive development in Boston say they are unsure who in Walsh’s administration is responsible for making key decisions on real estate projects.\n\t\nThere is still no permanent director at the Boston Redevelopment Authority. John Barros is the city’s new economic czar, but neither he nor the mayor has become immersed in the details of development. Meanwhile, the mayor has named an acting director of the BRAlaunched an audit of its operations, and terminated most of the employees in one of its divisions, prompting some to worry the agency is adrift.“It’s not moving as fast as everyone would like it to,” said Kevin Ahearn, president of the brokerage Otis & Ahearn, which is putting together a development on the Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy Greenway. “Everybody is anxious because the marketplace is so strong and the opportunity with the low interest rates is compelling.”Kevin Phelan, cochairman of the real estate firm Colliers International, said that opportunities for development in Boston aren’t going to disappear while the mayor puts a new team in place. Still, he said, it is critical for Walsh to create a clear chain of command on development matters.“The BRA head has to have direct access to the mayor,” he said. “Multiple layers will dilute things, and it will become problematic. But I think we all have to take a deep breath and give him some time.”\nSince Walsh became mayor, the BRA has approved redevelopment of the Landmark Center complex in the Fenway and a 600-unit apartment complex in the South End, projects already in the pipeline when Walsh took over for Thomas M. Menino. But the authority’s first three board meetings under Walsh dealt mostly with smaller projects, and no major new proposals have been announced.\n\n\t\nThe mayor’s decisions in the months ahead will affect the future of a historic building boom in Boston, which is experiencing a wave of opportunity as more residents and companies move into the city. Thousands of condominiums and luxury apartments are under construction, dozens of new restaurants have opened, and office buildings are rising from Dudley Square to the South Boston Innovation District.Walsh said the perception that there is a slowdown is due only to the breakneck pace of approvals in the final months of the Menino administration.“The reason large projects haven’t gone forward is because that past administration fast-tracked everything,” Walsh said. “They approved such a high rate of projects in the last three BRA meetings.”Those previously approved developments included a massive redevelopment of the Government Center Garage, a towering cluster of buildings in front of TD Garden, a hotel and condominium tower in the Back Bay, and large projects with office and retail space in Brighton and the South End.Not everyone thinks Walsh’s go-slow approach is a bad thing, especially as rapid building begins to redefine large swaths of the city.“It’s important to look at the type of density and type of development we’re doing,” said Carol Ridge Martinez, a Brighton resident and executive director of the Allston Brighton Community Development Corp. “If we don’t do it right, we’re going to be living with it for a long time, so I think the Walsh administration is wise to take time to figure things out.”The mayor said he will wait for the BRA audit results, expected in April, before making any major changes in personnel or structure. He said the authority will continue to review new proposals and try to advance previously stalled projects such as Fenway Center, a huge complex of apartments, stores, parking and offices near the famed ballpark.\nSome lawyers and others who work with developers say it’s hard to get moving with more substantial proposals that require support from the city. They declined to speak publicly because of concerns that doing so would cause their projects to fall out of favor at City Hall.One lawyer representing two clients with large projects downtown said he met with the BRA’s acting director, Brian Golden, more than a month ago but he’s still waiting to hear back about what steps to take next. During the Menino administration, the lawyer said, a response would have arrived within a week.  Now his projects are behind schedule.Golden said he understands that developers want to “seize the moment” in a rising market. When he started at the BRA in 2009, the Great Recession had virtually halted real estate activity. Now, construction cranes crowd the horizon.“It’s a radically different environment,” Golden said. “I want to keep it going.”He contends the BRA’s staff is busier than it was during the last few months under Menino. Golden said he has been meeting regularly with developers and anyone with concerns should call on him personally.But some real estate executives said they’re unsure if Golden is really in charge of development decisions. Once Walsh appointed Barros as the city’s economic development chief, some developers and residents started to approach him on real estate matters.For example, neighbors affected by Boston College’s development plans sent a letter outlining their concerns to Barros, not Golden, arguing the BRA had failed to adequately respond to community comments on BC’s campus master plan.Walsh said Barros is charged with recruiting businesses to the city, supporting real estate development, and fostering economic growth. He said the BRA remains responsible for planning and approving individual projects. The mayor said Golden is doing a good job, but he has not made any decisions about a permanent director.Walsh has said he wants an arms-length relationship with the BRA, giving it more authority to make community planning decisions without political interference. But the BRA has spent two decades under the direction of Menino, who routinely met with developers and became intimately involved in the details and design of real estate projects.Gregory Vasil, chief executive of the Greater Boston Real Estate Board, said changes at the BRA will continue to create some confusion for developers, who need a predictable process for costly, complicated projects.“Real estate industry people want certainty, and when things change it can be unsettling,” Vasil said. “But the process we’re going through now is inevitable, based on the fact that we have our first new mayor in 20 years.”
Mayor-elect Martin J. Walsh is backpedaling from one of his most prominent campaign promises, telling business leaders Thursday that he is in no hurry to restructure the powerful city agency that has approved a burst of development in recent years.During his campaign for mayor, Walsh said the Boston Redevelopment Authority needed an urgent overhaul, pledging to “in early 2014” replace it with a new economic development entity that would be more transparent and responsive to residents and businesses.\n\t\nBut he acknowledged Thursday that the proposal rankled many developers and business leaders, and he sought to reassure them that any changes would not disrupt the building boom that is transforming much of the city’s downtown and outlying neighborhoods.“If there’s going to be changes, they are going to be well thought out, and it’s going to be a collaboration with the business community to make sure that people feel comfortable,” he said. “There’s no way that I want to discourage development.”Throughout his remarks at the Boston Harbor Hotel, Walsh adopted the posture of an incoming mayor who is still trying to find his footing, instead of the confident candidate who months earlier had articulated a 14-point plan that would overhaul the BRA while spurring economic growth.The mayor-elect, who will take office Jan. 6, said he still intends to make adjustments to the BRA’s operations, but he noted that any major changes to its structure will not occur for several months. For example, he said the agency will continue to hold regular meetings early in 2014 to decide on projects now under review.“There are proposals in the pipeline and I want to continue moving them through,” he said.\n\t\nWalsh’s step back from dismantling the agency prompted relief from real estate executives who had fretted such action would halt one of the most significant periods of building activity in recent history. More than 5,000 homes are under construction across Boston, and offices and hotels are under construction from the South Boston Innovation District to the Fenway and Roxbury.“Why toy with the goose that appears to be laying a series of golden eggs?” said Jonathan Davis, a developer and chief executive of the Davis Cos. “It is impossible not to be struck by the vibrancy of the development going on everywhere and extending into the neighborhoods. It really seems like the planning process is working.”Not everyone agrees. Some observers have sharply criticized the agency, saying its review process is too often removed from the input of ordinary residents and favors select developers. And activists had been counting on Walsh to end what many see as a fundamental conflict between the BRA’s dual functions of community planning and economic development. They had asserted that the financial interests of developers are too often allowed to steamroll the concerns of neighbors.“I don’t see any reason why planning shouldn’t be separated on Jan. 7th,” said Jim Zahka, a West End resident who is on a panel reviewing a massive development proposed for the TD Garden area.The Menino administration on Thursday granted $7.8 million in tax breaks to help that project move forward, a move Zahka criticized as an unnecessary giveaway.The BRA has been in charge of reviewing all major developments in Boston since 1957. It was created with a mandate to reverse the urban decay that once infected swaths of the city.As the former head of a major building trades union, Walsh shares an interest with business and real estate executives in accelerating building activity, as it provides jobs for thousands of construction workers. In recent years, he has repeatedly appeared before the BRA to speak favorably on behalf of large development proposals.Even though Walsh stepped back from his commitment to immediately overhaul the BRA, Zahka held out hope that\nchange would eventually occur in a Walsh administration.“If Mayor-elect Walsh is willing to significantly beef up the BRA’s planning, and give it some independence, I think that would be outstanding,” he said.During the campaign, Walsh pledged to do exactly that. He said he would create separate offices for planning and development under a new entity to be called the Boston Economic Development Authority.Under his 14-point plan, that agency would replace the BRA and be helmed by a new director with greater independence from the mayor’s office. The agency’s current director serves at the pleasure of the mayor. Walsh even proposed to give the City Council oversight of the new agency’s finances, which would have relinquished a significant amount of his power over development.During his comments Thursday, Walsh said he intends to revisit some the ideas he floated during the race for mayor, although he did not specify which ones. “Some of the things we proposed in the campaign, we have to make sure it works,” he said. “I wouldn’t expect any major change until probably the second half of my first year in City Hall.”Walsh emphasized the need to attract new businesses to Boston and create a more predictable process for reviewing building proposals. He also noted that development activity in the city generates millions of dollars in annual tax receipts — providing funds for other new initiatives he promised during the campaign.“Long-term at the end of the day, the BRA is a very important function in our government,” Walsh said. “If we aren’t developing in Boston, the programs that I want to push for probably won’t happen.”
The five newest penguin chicks at the New England Aquarium have a big job to do — aside from being incredibly adorable. The three Little Blue and two African penguin chicks will serve as liaisons for their cousins in the wild and will increase the diversity of their species’s captive population’s gene pool.\n\t\nLittle Blue penguins originate from the southern coastlines of Australia and New Zealand and the African penguins inhabit land along the southern coast of Africa. Little Blues are the smallest species of penguin and have sleek, steel blue feathers. African penguins have yellow stripes on their foreheads in adulthood. The Little Blue chicks, two of which have joined the rest of the colony while one remains under staff care, have fuzzy charcoal gray downy feathers when they hatch. The New England Aquarium is one of the only institutions in the United States that has Little Blues, something that Heather Urquhart, penguin exhibit manager for the aquarium, hopes to change. “There is a lot of interest in getting more of these little guys in zoos and aquariums here,” Urquhart said. “We are working with the Aussies to get more little birds to some other cities.”The chicks have joined the ranks of only 64 Little Blues in United States zoos and aquariums — 29 of which are housed in the New England Aquarium. The sustainability of such a small population is a big concern, especially with regard to gene diversity and potential growth.“These birds are teaching zoo- and aquarium-goers about their wild brethren and we want them to be as healthy as possible,” Urquhart said. “We want to not only have a healthy and diverse population in our own aquarium, but for the populations in zoos and aquariums everywhere.”\n\t\nUrquhart is currently working closely with the Bronx Zoo in New York and the Taronga Zoo in Australia to bring more Little Blues stateside within the next few months. The African penguins’ captive population is very strong, with about 800 birds living throughout the country, said Urquhart. Their wild counterparts, however, are facing serious challenges caused by climate change. Dan Laughlin, assistant curator at the New England Aquarium, said the endangered African penguins are seeing a mass exodus of their food source — primarily pilchards and anchovies — because of changing water temperatures in their native areas. Eleven of the 18 species of penguins are endangered. The 12- and 13-day-old African penguin chicks will join their 41-member colony at around 60 days old. Another African egg is due to hatch in mid-August. Laughlin said all penguin chicks must undergo a few private swimming lessons and weaning from their parents before joining the 85-bird colony at the aquarium. He added that he loves this time of year, and not just because of the chicks’ fuzzy cuteness.“I love the smell of baby penguins,” he said. “It’s the best smell in the world.”
Authorities investigating a former funeral home director who allegedly stole $12,000 from a client found 12 bodies at a storage facility in Weymouth Thursday, just one day after they found remains in a Somerville storage unit, prosecutors said.Detectives found the bodies in a Public Storage unit on Main Street in Weymouth, the office of Suffolk District Attorney Daniel F. Conley said in a statement. The investigators are focusing on Joseph V. O’Donnell, 55, a former funeral home director in Dorchester who is currently in custody on larceny charges.\n\t\n“Our top priority right now is determining the identity of the remains we’ve discovered,” Conley said in the statement. “We’ve seized records and documents that could help us locate those people’s families, but this will be a time- and labor-intensive task.”Jake Wark, a spokesman for the district attorney, said, “By late this evening, detectives and pathologists had recovered 12 bodies from the Weymouth storage facility.”Just a day earlier, police investigating O’Donnell found cremated remains in a storage unit on Linwood Street in Somerville.Officials at that storage facility could not be reached Thursday night. A corporate spokesman for Public Storage in Weymouth declined to comment.Conley’s office said authorities were sending the remains from the Weymouth site to the chief medical examiner.\n\t\nA woman who identified herself as O’Donnell’s sister-in-law declined to comment when reached by phone late Thursday.O’Donnell is being held on bail on charges that he took funeral prepayment funds from an elderly couple hoping to cover the cost of two future services at his funeral home on Neponset Avenue. When they asked to transfer one of the payments to another relative who had died, prosecutors said, the funeral home was closed and O’Donnell could not provide them with their money.O’Donnell was arrested April 10 and is due back in court Friday, Conley’s office said.Prosecutors said Thursday that O’Donnell’s funeral director license lapsed in 2008, but he may have continued to make funeral arrangements since then. \n\n
When her granddaughter died three years ago, April Hopkins asked Joseph V. O’Donnell, a funeral home director in Dorchester, to cremate the baby’s remains. Hopkins contacted him again the next year, when her son and mother died just a few months apart.On Friday, Hopkins came from her home in Randolph to Dorchester Municipal Court, alarmed by news reports that investigators had discovered 12 bodies and dozens of cremated remains in two storage facilities O’Donnell had rented.\n\t\n“I’m devastated,” she said. “I put a lot of trust in the man. Now I don’t know if the remains I have are the right ones. Is one of those bodies my mother? Is one of those bodies my son?”Authorities made the grisly discoveries this week as part of an investigation into O’Donnell, 55, who is in custody for allegedly stealing $12,000 in funeral expenses from an elderly Quincy couple.On Wednesday, investigators found more than 40 sets of cremated remains in a storage facility in Somerville, and on Thursday, they recovered a dozen adult bodies from a similar unit in Weymouth.Investigators have sent the remains to the medical examiner’s office and will seek to identify the bodies. The cremated remains were labeled and can be traced to documents.“We’re confident we’ll be able to confirm the identity of each of those cremated remains,” said Jake Wark, a spokesman for Suffolk District Attorney Daniel F. Conley.\n\t\nThe deaths do not appear suspicious, Wark said. O’Donnell has not been charged in connection to the unburied remains.Many funeral homes hold unclaimed cremated remains that are left behind by loved ones.The investigation began earlier this year when state regulators informed authorities that they suspected that O’Donnell had been making funeral arrangements without a license; his lapsed in 2008. O’Donnell was the director of O’Donnell and Mulry Funeral Home on Neponset Avenue.In March, the Quincy couple told Boston police they had paid O’Donnell more than $12,000 in 2011 for future expenses at his funeral home.But when they contacted him earlier this year to make arrangements for their daughter, they learned that the funeral home was no longer in business. O’Donnell told them he would return their money, but never did, according to court documents.A few weeks later, the couple tried to contact him through another funeral home where he had worked, but the director said no one had heard from him recently. O’Donnell was arrested April 10 and remains in custody on $10,000 bail.At a brief court hearing in the larceny case Friday, Assistant District Attorney Nicholas Walsh said O’Donnell was now the target of a “substantial investigation.”The next hearing is scheduled for Aug. 29.O’Donnell’s lawyer, Paul Tomasetti, could not be reached for comment.Outside the courtroom, Dahria Williams-Fernandes, a funeral director in Dorchester, said she was stunned by the charges.“It’s astonishing to me,” she said. “It’s our responsibility to protect the deceased entrusted to our care.”Authorities said there is no evidence of other missing remains, but Williams-Fernandes said the discoveries are deeply unsettling.“At this point, we don’t know how deep this goes,” she said.\n\n• \n
Dr. Joep Lange of the Netherlands, a leading AIDS researcher, often visited Boston to recruit physicians and researchers for his campaign against the deadly virus. He wanted Massachusetts’ best doctors to help him make antiretroviral drugs accessible to the world’s poorest populations.One of those doctors was Dr. Martin Hirsch, a physician at Massachusetts General Hospital on the front line in the battle against AIDS. After he learned that Lange was among the 298 killed on the Malaysian airlines flight shot down Thursday in eastern Ukraine, he mourned the loss of a pioneering AIDS researcher, as well as a good friend.\n\t\nHirsch knew that the fight against AIDS would suffer without one of its most innovative and compassionate leaders.“He was a leading light, and he was a person who pushed probably as hard or harder than anyone for equity in the field, to make the drugs that we were using in the US and Netherlands available at a low cost for people in underserved areas of the world,” said Hirsch, who knew Lange for more than 20 years.Lange, 59, a former president of the International AIDS Society and executive scientific director of the Amsterdam Institute for Global Health and Development, was one of several researchers on the downed plane who were on their way to the International AIDS Conference in Melbourne, Australia, meeting organizers said.Early-arriving attendees were stunned by news of the tragedy, with some milling about in tears. But the conference is still scheduled to start Sunday.Dr. Dan Barouch, chief of the division of vaccine research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, is in Melbourne for the conference. He said the mood has been somber and attendees have been anxious as they wait to hear who else was on the flight.\n\t\n“To some extent, tragedies help people reaffirm the resolve to the causes the victims had,” said Barouch, who knew Lange for many years. “These were people trying to make the world a better place.”The World Health Organization confirmed Friday that Glenn Thomas, 49, a communications officer, had also been aboard Malaysia Airlines Flight 17. So had Pim de Kuijer, 32, a Dutch AIDS activist and former European Commission diplomat, and Jacqueline van Tongeren, 64, Lange’s partner and a communications director at his Amsterdam institute.Michel Sidibé — executive director of UNAIDS, the United Nations agency overseeing efforts to combat the disease — said in a statement that it is believed that “some of the finest academics, health care workers, and activists in the AIDS response” were among the passengers.“We are bracing ourselves to hear of the deaths of others who worked in the AIDS response,” he said. “The deaths of so many committed people working against HIV will be a great loss for the AIDS response.”Hirsch served on the International AIDS Society’s board of directors when Lange was president from 2002 to 2004, and the two worked together on the journal Antiviral Therapy, where Lange had been serving as co-editor in chief.Hundreds of thousands of people in underserved parts of the world were taking antiretroviral drugs when Lange became president of the society, Hirsch said. Now, about 12 million people in these areas are treated, and Lange “deserves as much credit as anybody for this change in attitude,” Hirsch said.Lange was eulogized Thursday night at a dinner for AIDS researchers in Melbourne. Dr. David Margolis, an AIDS researcher at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who attended the dinner, said speakers had recalled a quotation by Lange: “If we can get a cold can of Coke to any part of Africa, we can certainly deliver AIDS treatment.”AIDS research organizations around the world joined in mourning Lange.“Joep Lange was a towering presence in the fight against AIDS since the beginning of the epidemic and a wonderful friend, colleague, and teacher,” Kevin Robert Frost, chief executive of the AIDS research nonprofit amfAR, said in a statement. “He inspired legions of AIDS researchers, health care workers, and activists and was an inspiration to me personally. He will be sorely missed.”Hirsch and Lange first met in 1992, when they were planning an International AIDS Conference in Boston. They ultimately moved the conference to Amsterdam because the United States banned HIV-positive travelers from entering the country.Hirsch often worked with Lange when he visited Boston.\n“He’s a warm person with a great sense of humor, great wisdom, and an extremely hard worker who had empathy for the underserved parts of the world, as well as for the developed world,” Hirsch said.The pain is familiar for Hirsch, who lost a Harvard AIDS research colleague in 1998 in a plane crash. Dr. Jonathan Mann, who spent much of his career at the Harvard School of Public Health and founded the World Health Organization’s Global Program on AIDS, was on his way to Geneva to attend a series of global strategy sessions on AIDS when his plane crashed near Nova Scotia.
Five years ago, Lyndia Downie had a crazy idea. What if Pine Street Inn, a haven for Boston’s homeless, reinvented itself, turning from an emergency shelter provider to a landlord?Downie, who runs Pine Street, warned her board it would be a hard-to-stomach decision, one that would involve closing some shelters and shifting those resources to instead buy homes. Today, that change is official: Pine Street Inn now manages more beds in homes than in shelters. Just a decade ago, the ratio was about 30 percent housing to 70 percent shelter beds.\n\t\nIt’s a bold strategy and one the city, which also runs shelters, is accelerating under the Walsh administration. Could Boston be on the verge of solving chronic homelessness?“I am hoping within a handful of years,” said housing chief Sheila Dillon.\nThat’s amazing, given that we just went through a deep recession, and signs point to a widening gap between rich and poor in this city, where there will be two Four Seasons but hardly anywhere for the middle class to live.What Downie saw years ago was buried in a trove of data she scoured: 5 percent of the homeless population took up more than half of the beds at Pine Street on any given night.The truth is that most people who come through Pine Street are there because of a temporary crisis. \n\t\nThey often just need a place to stay for a few days. But Downie began to imagine what would happen if Pine Street focused on that 5 percent — the people who live on the street for months or years.Few people thought her idea would work. These street people didn’t want help. Not true. A year after moving into a Pine Street home — where they also receive counseling — 96 percent of the chronically homeless are still there.Downie didn’t come up with the idea of “housing first” for the homeless. It actually came from New York. But while it will take more than one good idea to solve New York’s massive problem, Boston stands a fighting chance. Our city has about 300 chronically homeless, down from about 570 in 2009.“That’s solvable,” Downie said this week at a former Mission Hill hospice Pine Street has converted into a 18-unit house, one of three dozen the nonprofit owns in Boston and Brookline.\nOverall, Pine Street manages nearly 900 permanent beds compared with about 670 emergency beds. And thanks to a recent $20 million capital campaign funded by private donors, it will be able to maintain those properties and buy more.If not for the Mission Hill house, Paul Sullivan would be in and out of shelters.He had a drinking problem that left him jobless and homeless. The former insurance administrator is now sober and has lived under the same roof for five years. Sullivan, 61, pays $238 a month in rent, or 30 percent of his Social Security disability income.He has his own room, and shares a kitchen and bathroom. It feels like a home. “The camaraderie is terrific,” Sullivan said. He does volunteer work and hopes to some day get a part-time paying job.That’s good for everyone. The chronically homeless regularly end up in emergency rooms and tax public safety systems; keeping them in long-term housing adds up to an annual savings of $9,500 per person, according to advocacy group Massachusetts Housing and Shelter Alliance.That’s a big reason why the Patrick administration is also helping to fund Pine Street Inn’s “housing first” initiative, as well as similar efforts around the state, said Aaron Gornstein, undersecretary for housing and community development.No one is saying that emergency shelters will disappear, certainly not at Pine Street. But we have a shot at making chronic homelessness a thing of the past. \n\n• \n• \n• \n• \n
A freelance music teacher from Milton was arrested this month and charged with enticing a child under 16, prosecutors said.Mark Snyder, 62, pleaded not guilty in Brookline District Court on July 8 to the enticing allegation as well as possession with intent to distribute a Class B substance, according to David Traub, a spokesman for Norfolk District Attorney Michael W. Morrissey.\n\t\nSnyder was freed on $500 cash bail. He was ordered to have no unsupervised contact with children under 16, according to Traub. If he violates those orders, he could be held without bail for up to 60 days.Officials were unable to divulge details of what led to Snyder being charged.Snyder declined to comment on the matter Friday. His lawyer, Patrick J. Murphy, also did not want to speak about the case.The conditions of Snyder’s bail extend to his employment as a freelance music teacher, according to Traub. Snyder is listed as an adjunct faculty member at the Noble and Greenough school in Dedham on the school’s website. A call to the school was not returned.Snyder was employed by the Paul Effman Music Co., which schools in the Boston Catholic Archdiocese contract with, according to Terrence Donilon, spokesman for the archdiocese. \n\t\nPrincipals at St. Mary of the Hills in Milton, Sacred Heart School in Roslindale, and Quincy Catholic Academy in Quincy sent a communication to parents telling them that “we are shocked and concerned to learn of the recent allegations involving an individual who was contracted to provide musical instruction during our afterschool program.”“We learned that an employee of the Paul Effman Music Company who was contracted to provide musical instruction for students in the program was arrested by Brookline Police Monday night during an ongoing police investigation. The safety and wellbeing of our students, faculty and staff are our highest priorities and we take these matters very seriously.“Please be assured that we have no indication that this allegation involved a student and there have been no prior complaints made against this individual involving any student. We are re-evaluating whether to continue the relationship with Paul Effman Music Company for next school year.”Snyder is slated to return to court on Aug. 25 for a pre-trial conference, Traub said.
\n Martin Walsh is hunting for ways to accelerate progress in Roxbury’s Dudley Square, a low-income neighborhood that is on the rise. On Monday, he issued a formal “Request for Ideas” on how best to create a 3,350-square-foot “innovation center” as part of the redevelopment of the historic Ferdinand Building, which stood empty in the middle of the square for three decades before the city tapped the site as the future headquarters of the Boston School Department.Innovation centers can take the form of co-working space for high-tech entrepreneurs, incubators for startup companies, and even areas with shared access to the latest in computer-controlled manufacturing equipment. Sophisticated examples can be found in Kendall Square in Cambridge and along Boston’s waterfront. Entrepreneurs in these areas, however, are not about to dash off to Dudley Square. There is no limit to their imaginations in the quest for breakthrough technologies. But when it comes time to choose an office location, high-tech entrepreneurs adopt a ghetto mentality. They prefer the company of like-minded innovators. And by forming into clusters, startups make it easy for investors to scout for new opportunities.\n\t\nDudley Square offers one significant advantage to innovators and investors: its future as a center of educational policy and operations. By the fall of 2015, about 500 Boston School Department employees are scheduled to leave their downtown headquarters and move into the Ferdinand Building. University officials and charter school operators who maintain partnerships with Boston’s school district will come and go on regular business. National and even international experts will visit the Ferdinand Building to see how Boston meets the challenges of urban education. Why not really give them something to see, think about, and even purchase?Education technology companies that develop hardware and software for the classroom would be a perfect fit for Dudley Square. Several of these so-called ed-tech entrepreneurs are spread around various locations in Boston, where they create software for teacher evaluations, digital alternatives to expensive tutors, lesson plans linked to public radio stories, applications to engage alumni, and dozens of other educational products and services. An ed-tech sector could take root in the Ferdinand Building. And the most promising products and services could be tested in some of Boston’s 128 schools. MIT graduate and urban planner Gilad Rosenzweig sees great potential in bringing educational technology startup companies to the Ferdinand Building. Meanwhile, he is out to prove that there is plenty of local tech talent in parts of Boston far removed from the downtown Innovation District. On Wednesday, Rosenzweig cut the ribbon on his brainchild — Smarter in the City — in a converted triple decker at nearby 100 Warren Street that will house a high-tech business accelerator. For the next six months, Smarter in the City will provide five groups of local entrepreneurs with free rent, office amenities, and technical guidance. Paul and Amanda Barros, a local brother-and-sister team, intend to spend evenings and weekends developing TrendOn.tv, a platform that will allow users to take screenshots of fashions worn by their favorite celebrities, upload the images, and search for them as if from a catalogue. Down the hall, three partners with local roots are preparing to spend the next six months expanding their multi-media publishing company — KillerBoomBox. They described the operation as an authentic but “less salacious” doorway into the lifestyles and culture of urban youths. Other independent ideas rising from the neighborhood include SkyLab, the brainchild of urban planner Bridgette Wallace. She is scouting for space to teach Web development, crowdsourcing, computer-aided design, and other techniques needed to connect residents of the area with the latest technologies.The Walsh administration may need to cope with old-style politics in its effort to stimulate an innovation economy in Roxbury. The neighborhood’s entrenched network of social service vendors and workers’ alliances might make a noisy bid for space in the Ferdinand Building. But there hasn’t been anything innovative in the approach of Roxbury’s old guard for decades.If a great proposal does emerge, the innovation center in the Ferdinand Building has the capacity to nearly triple in size, according to Boston’s economic development chief John Barros. He said he’s looking for uses or startup companies with the potential to “spill out of that space and spark new (economic) relationships” in the surrounding neighborhood. If Barros really wants sparks, he should try rubbing two things together: Boston’s school department and education technology startups.
\nthe dithering delays plaguing Congress, the most maddening is its inability to do anything about gun violence. Nineteen months after the massacre at the Sandy Hook elementary school, which was supposed to be the turning point on gun policy, Congress has done nothing. Meanwhile, by some estimates, 50,000 additional Americans have been killed by guns. No wonder frustrated citizens are going around Congress to focus on the gun industry itself.\n is a new initiative aimed at getting individuals and institutions to divest from gun company stocks that support the manufacture and sale of assault weapons. Some 51 million Americans hold 401(k)s or other retirement funds, and it’s a fair bet many don’t know exactly what they include. Taxpayer dollars and donations to nonprofits prop up pension funds and endowments that can be invested in activities that donors don’t support. Corporate interlocks make it difficult to tease apart the trouble spots: Cerberus Capital Management, the private equity firm that controls Freedom Group — which manufactures the Bushmaster assault rifle used at Sandy Hook — also owns the seemingly innocuous Star Market, Shaw’s, and Steward Health Care System. What’s a responsible consumer to do?\n\t\nNormally I’m skeptical about boycotts as a political tactic, because with few exceptions — the antiapartheid campaign for South African divestment most notably — they can feel like spitting against the wind. But the gun divestment campaign has had some surprising successes. Last fall Rhode Island’s pension fund dumped a $20 million investment in a private equity fund with a stake in a gun distributor. That came after California’s public pension fund, the country’s largest, divested from two firearms firms. In February, Occidental College, in Los Angeles, became the first university to ban investments in companies manufacturing military-style assault weapons.Here in Massachusetts, treasurer of the state’s pension portfolio in the wake of the Sandy Hook shooting and reported that $27.8 million was invested in the gun industry — less than 1 percent of the total. As with other divestment questions, Grossman let the Legislature decide whether his office should be required to sell the firearms stocks, but a bill doing so stalled this session. Still, Grossman himself supports divestment. “These are issues of moral responsibility,” he said. “Sometimes you’ve got to stand up and speak up for Massachusetts values.”Ordinary citizens also have a role. Since the “Unload your 401(k)” campaign launched in late April, more than 10,000 people have checked their personal retirement accounts through the campaign’s website. Those who discover gun companies in their portfolios can sell, or ask their employers or unions to make different investment choices. “I believe as a consumer you do the best you can,” said Cathie Whittenburg of States United to Prevent Gun Violence, one of the campaign’s partners. Foiled by inaction in Washington, she said, investing with a social conscience “is something I can do.”John Rosenthal, founder of Stop Handgun Violence, knows how difficult it is to make a dent in the profits of gun manufacturers, but he believes there is power in numbers. “There are more of us than there are of them,” he said. “If enough of us vote with our wallets, I really think we can change behavior.”Particularly galling to Rosenthal is Cerberus, which promised just after Sandy Hook We have determined to immediately engage in a formal process to sell our investment in Freedom Group,” it said in December 2012. Nothing ever came of the promise. Apparently there is some part of “immediately” that Cerberus doesn’t understand.Rosenthal is now promoting a boycott of the local grocery chains in the Cerberus portfolio, hoping it will reconsider hanging on to Freedom Group. He explicitly conflates “guns, bread, and butter” in his plea to shoppers not to patronize familiar stores. The difficulty, he says, is getting a demoralized public to recognize that many small gestures can make a compelling statement.The gun lobby — with its money, its influence, its cowed members of Congress — thrives on the perception that it is invincible. The Campaign to Unload is a creative strategy to puncture that notion. It gives the majority a voice. And that’s democracy’s most powerful weapon.

\nFebruary, Senator Kay Hagan of North Carolina formally announced her reelection bid. The moderate Democrat, a former bank executive who rode President Obama’s coattails to a narrow upset victory over Republican incumbent Elizabeth Dole in 2008, was heading into a tough campaign against Thom Tillis, the speaker of the state House of Representatives. Americans for Prosperity, the Tea Party group funded by the billionaire Koch brothers, had already dished out more than $3 million for ads attacking Hagan — a mere precursor of an ugly eight months to come. But on this day, at least, the senator figured to have the news cycle all to herself, with Tar Heel TV stations broadcasting the usual announcement fanfare of broad smiles and soundbite-worthy platitudes. All went according to plan , and about her past echoing of Obama’s claim that “if you like your insurance plan, you can keep it.” She’d been asked such questions dozens of times, no doubt, but the senator still had no answer. As campaign staffers anxiously whisked her away from the podium and outside to her waiting car, reporters chased Hagan, repeating the Obamacare questions. Finally, she responded, somewhat mysteriously, “It wasn’t clear that insurance companies were selling substandard policies.” Cue the evening sound bite: the backside of Senator Hagan fleeing from journalists in her bright pink announcement-day dress, dodging questions about a seminal controversy. “Dodging,” along with its synonym “ducking,” would soon become the verb of choice for headlines about the Hagan campaign. \n\n\n\n\n\t\nIt was not, to say the least, what the senator’s strategists had in mind. But Hagan’s tentative attitude has become a common theme across the South this year. As the region has become the Republican Party’s national fortress, Southern Democrats have won Senate seats by playing down their ties to their party.This year, six Democrats — three incumbents and three challengers — are waging competitive campaigns. The results in North Carolina, Georgia, Kentucky, Arkansas, Louisiana, and Mississippi could determine whether Obama faces a hostile Senate for his last two years in the White House. (, and .) The question is whether Democrats in these states are better served by following the region’s five-decade-long drift toward the GOP — or by betting that the climate is finally changing in their favor.\n\n\nin states like North Carolina, where large influxes of Latino immigrants and “relocated Yankees,” both black and white, are tilting the demographic balance toward the Democrats and inspiring a new progressive movement. But despite Obama’s own surprising Southern breakthroughs — after Al Gore and John Kerry lost the entire region, he won three large Southern states in 2008 and two in 2012, falling just short in North Carolina — the region’s blue future is still a long-term proposition. Candidates like Hagan are stuck between the past, when Southern Democrats’ recipe for victory involved courting white moderates and conservativesand a future in which they’ll be able to successfully campaign as full-throated, national-style Democrats. To win, Hagan and her compatriots must simultaneously woo independent-minded whites while persuading massive numbers of young voters and nonwhites, who lean left on both economic and social issues, to join them. It’s an awkward proposition, to be sure. But the Democratic contenders have appeared hell-bent on making it look downright impossible. A few months after Hagan fumbled her big day, Georgia Democrat Michelle Nunn — a lavishly funded first-time candidate who is the daughter of much-loved former Senator Sam Nunn — . But when Nunn, whom The Guardian newspaper has described as exerting “robot-like control” over her carefully scripted campaign, was asked by the friendly reporter about her stance on Obamacare, the script turned to mush. Pressed on whether she’d have voted for the Affordable Care Act, Nunn prevaricated, kvetched, and weaved, before finally offering that “it’s impossible to look back retrospectively.” In a subsequent interview with Politico, Nunn — who’s running in a state that is now more than 40 percent nonwhite and headed toward being “majority-minority” — even declined to say whether she’d support Harry Reid as Senate majority leader or whether Obama is doing a good job.\n\t\nNunn, like Hagan, is running a classic Southern Democratic campaign, in which the great goal is to come across as a milder version of a Republican. The same is true for incumbent senators Mark Pryor of Arkansas and Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, and for Democratic challengers Travis Childers in Mississippi and Alison Lundergan Grimes, the young Kentucky secretary of state who’s waging a fierce battle to unseat Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. The demographics in those four states aren’t trending Democratic the way North Carolina or Georgia are, but the candidates face the same dilemma: How do you sound like the future while running a campaign that’s rooted in the past? \n\nOnly Landrieu, who’s running a tight race for a fourth term in a state that is one-third African-American, has found an issue to run on — as opposed to spending all her time running away from sticky issues like Obamacare, which she has (mostly) defended without reservation. But Landrieu’s big selling point is hardly a traditional Democratic one. As the newly minted chair of the Senate Energy Committee, she’s cast herself as an ardent booster of the state’s oil and gas industries, championing the Keystone pipeline and distancing herself from Obama by loudly and frequently decrying the Obama EPA’s new greenhouse-gas regulations. “I’ve been in Washington a long time — some say too long, but I hope not,” Landrieu recently told the Louisiana Farm Bureau Federation Convention. “My seniority is your clout.” An  — a prominent Republican donor, no less — put a slightly different spin on the same theme: “Louisiana can’t afford to lose Mary Landrieu.” \n the Democrats’ messages are comically muddled. Their races are competitive mostly because of the deep flaws in their Republican opponents. In Kentucky, Grimes has a shot because McConnell, a leader in the seismically unpopular Congress, has approval ratings that are as bad as Obama’s. The Republican seeking to unseat Hagan in North Carolina, Thom Tillis, has a similar problem: He’s the most prominent leader of a legislature whose right-wing policy making has made it more radioactive than Obama. Mississippi’s longtime Republican senator, Thad Cochran, narrowly survived a runoff in late June with Tea Party challenger Chris McDaniel, and at 76, he’s shown his age on the campaign trail; asked at one point what he’d do after the election, Cochran replied, all too honestly, that he’d “take a nap.” Now the senator is fending off legal challenges as McDaniel and the Tea Party furiously claim voter fraud in the runoff. In Arkansas, pundits considered Democratic Senator Mark Pryor a likely loser against Representative Tom Cotton, a young war veteran and rising Tea Party star — until Cotton revealed himself to be an unwavering right-wing ideologue and a cold fish on the campaign trail. \nBut for Democrats, “I’m not that other guy you can’t stand” is hardly a campaign message that will motivate the base. That’s especially true in a midterm year, when it’s the most reliably Democratic voters — young people and minorities — who are likeliest to sit out election day. “They’re going to stay home again unless we make sure they understand why there’s something big at stake in 2014,” says Page Gleason, who runs the state’s new progressive voter-mobilization group, Pro-Georgia. Nunn, whose campaign ads don’t identify her as a Democrat, is doing them no favors. \n\nIf Democratic-leaning voters in Georgia voted in similar numbers to Republicans, the state would already be blue. But the Democrats’ old habit of running Republican Lite campaigns, while it’s given them a chance to win the occasional statewide election in a good year, has convinced much of what could be the base that there’s little reason to bother with voting. Statewide,  — much more than . “The old blue-dog model doesn’t work anymore,” says Ed Kilgore, a Georgia native and Democratic strategist who helped craft that model during his years with the centrist Democratic Leadership Council. “The people you’re appealing to aren’t going to vote for any Democrat anymore. You just don’t go right on every conceivable issue.” But that is exactly what his old friend Nunn — aside from her progressive stances on abortion rights and gay marriage, which she doesn’t like to talk about — is doing. Her platform consists of reducing corporate tax rates, entitlement “reform” (read: cuts) and debt reduction, supporting the Keystone pipeline, and cheering for military strikes in Syria. It’s not exactly catnip for the state’s emerging majority. \n\nThe surest way to fire up young people and minorities in Georgia — and North Carolina, Mississippi, and Louisiana — would be for the Democratic candidates to grit their teeth, take the plunge, and embrace Obama, even just a little. There’s a reason, after all, why turnout in most Southern states skyrocketed with the president topping the ticket. The voting rate in North Carolina went from  to ; in Georgia and Mississippi, turnout was even lower in  and  than in North Carolina, but . While the president might not exactly be beloved in a state like Georgia, his : 42 percent. Nunn is running neck and neck for an open seat against two potential Republican challengers. (The GOP primary is Tuesday.) Surely a big late-October rally in Atlanta, with Obama embracing Nunn on a stage packed with homegrown civil-rights legends like Andrew Young and Representative John Lewis, would be exactly what Nunn, would need to push her over the top — and, very likely, keep Democrats in control of the Senate. Obama’s presence could also fire up conservative whites, but that would make a marginal difference: It’s those very voters who tend to show up for mid-term elections, and they’re already itching to cast one last anti-Obama vote in 2014.\nlike Nunn are about as likely to welcome Obama as they are to make a public announcement that they’ve converted to French socialism. Southern Democrats have turned Obama-avoidance into a virtual art form — even Hagan, who wouldn’t have a Senate seat without the success of the Obama machine in 2008. In January, when , Hagan said she was too busy in Washington to make the trip. Hagan’s snub turned into one more public-relations fiasco when Obama pointedly brought up her absence and cheekily gave her the kind of endorsement that gives her campaign staff nightmares: “Your senator, Kay Hagan, couldn’t be here,” he said, “but I wanted to thank her publicly for the great work she’s been doing.” Most of the next day’s headlines read a lot like \nWhat might happen if Democrats in the fast-evolving 21st-century South ran as honest-to-goodness, true-blue Democrats? Because the old Republican Lite habit dies hard — and because politicians of all stripes are timid by nature — we won’t find out this year. But it won’t be long. Perhaps in 2016, maybe in 2020, the mold will be broken: A new-style Southern Democrat will run in a state like Georgia or North Carolina or Texas and win with a full-throated progressive message. The demographics make it inevitable. And the result ultimately will be a whole new national political order. No longer will it be Southerners in Congress who are the stubborn impediments to progressive reform, as they’ve been for 150 years. And no longer will Republicans have a stranglehold on the region in presidential elections. The five largest Southern states — Georgia, Virginia, North Carolina, Texas, and Florida — account for most of the region’s electoral votes. They’re also the states where conservative whites are losing their hegemony by the day. How will the GOP carry national elections without them? By the next decade, if demographics are (and they usually are) destiny, it will be Southern Republicans who are dodging and ducking and triangulating, conjuring ways to hold on to their aging and shrinking white base while appropriating Democratic issues and rhetoric to woo the new progressive majority. If they need tactical advice, they can always hire Kay Hagan or Michelle Nunn as campaign consultants. Their species of Southern Democrat will be, by then, a fading relic of a strange, distant, and inexplicable past. 
It’s a long way from Savin Hill to Beacon Hill, a distance measured not so much in miles as in time.On Beacon Hill, you’ll find a few of the grandees fondly recalling that their people came over in the 17th century, on the Mayflower or some other such boat.\n\t\nMarty Walsh, the mayor, grew up in Savin Hill, a neighborhood thick with immigrants, where most people measure their residence in the city by years or months.Walsh’s parents, John and Mary Walsh, left the rocky, russet land of Connemara, in the west of Ireland, in the 1950s, in separate years and on separate boats, to find work in Boston. They fell in love at a dance in Roxbury, got married at St. Mary’s in Dedham, and settled into one floor of a three-decker on Taft Street in Savin Hill. Mary Walsh still lives in that three-decker. John Walsh, sadly, died a few years ago, which is too bad, because he was a wonderful guy and I would have loved to have a cup of coffee with him at McKenna’s on Savin Hill Ave. and ask him what he thought of the shower of snobs who bristled at his son, the mayor, the other night on Beacon Hill.You see, as mayor of the city of Boston, Marty Walsh had the audacity, the sheer and unmitigated gall, to go before his betters and suggest that they have to .\xa0.\xa0.  obey the law.And, to make matters worse, the mayor is doing this on behalf of people in wheelchairs. Marty Walsh told the high hats on Beacon Hill they can no longer be the only neighborhood in the city to resist installation of sidewalk ramps to help people with disabilities. \n\n\t\nCan you imagine that? A guy from Dorchester siding with the disabled over the\n entitled set on Beacon Hill.What’s got into this guy?Well, at one level it’s all about numbers. Some people on Beacon Hill like to talk about 1620, the year the Mayflower landed. The mayor and his people are a little more familiar with 1585. That was the gap in the mayor’s race last year: Marty Walsh lost Beacon Hill to John Connolly, 15 to 85 percent.I told the mayor he should have gotten up before the Beacon Hill crowd and told them that his people were on the Mayflower with their people. And when all the old ladies leaned forward, clutching their pearls in sudden, earnest interest, the mayor could have deadpanned, “Yeah. My people were downstairs, rowing.”The mayor didn’t think much of my idea. Actually, as we were sitting in his office on Friday, he was excited about some real news, and, frankly, a bunch of elitists from Beacon Hill telling the great unwashed to leave them alone hardly constitutes news. The news is, Marty Walsh is going home in September, and home is not so much Savin Hill as it is the hills of Connemara, where his parents grew up.\n\nConnemara is in the Gaeltacht, the Irish-speaking region of Galway. This sometimes gets lost in translation, but Walsh is the first mayor of Boston to grow up in a house where his parents’ native language was not English. That explains, in part, where his natural sympathies lie, and why he did better in minority neighborhoods than he did where the lace curtain Irish live in West Roxbury, not to mention Beacon Hill.Now, John and Mary Walsh certainly had good English when they got here, but there was always a deep and abiding respect on Taft Street for immigrants who come here without English, looking for work and something called dignity.Mary Walsh is from Rosmuc, a village that supplied about half the congregation at Gate of Heaven in Southie and St. Brendan’s in Dorchester. When the mayor gets to Connemara, he’ll go to Saturday afternoon Mass with his mother at the church where she was baptized. The next day, they’ll drive about a half hour west, along the coast, out to Carna, and go to Mass in the village where John Walsh grew up.\n\nOn the drive from Connemara up to Donegal, before heading on to Derry, Belfast, and Dublin, the mayor and his mother plan to stop at the Knock Shrine in County Mayo, where his mom took him to pray after he was diagnosed with cancer as a 7-year-old.While this homecoming, Sept. 19 through the Sept. 24, won’t have the historic weight that Jack Kennedy’s presidential visit to Ireland in 1963 had, it will be far more personal. In Wexford, Kennedy was introduced to distant cousins he had never met. Marty Walsh is related to half of the people, and knows just about everybody, in Rosmuc and Carna. Of his 10 first cousins there, half  have lived in Boston at one time or another.There’s a big Marty Walsh sign on the outskirts of Carna. He will have to pose in front of it for photos. About 500 times.“I can’t wait,” the mayor said.But in the meantime, he’s got to run a city, and deal with the likes of those on Beacon Hill who were having the vapors over the prospect of cuts being made in their sidewalks so people in wheelchairs can get around.Somebody got up to voice opposition to the yellow stripes that are typically installed in the ramps. They wanted gray stripes, even though that’s not as good for the visually impaired. Then somebody said they wanted granite ramps because they look better than the concrete ones in the rest of the city. They should: They cost four times as much. Then somebody suggested shaved bricks, and I’m thinking, who knew bricks have hair?Still, for all the complaints from the whine and cheese set, the best contribution of the night came from a longtime Beacon Hill resident named Connaught Mahony, who is 84 years old, and whose husband, Gael, was the first president of the Beacon Hill Civic Association. Gael Mahony, a great lawyer, was a centurion for the neighborhood for decades, resisting an expansionist Suffolk University. \nMrs. Mahony made it clear that she opposed the whole idea of sidewalk ramps, saying they would destroy the neighborhood’s character. She had a proposal.“Why can’t we have a handicapped lane,” Connaught Mahony asked, “just like we have bike lanes?”I only wish the mayor’s uncle, Pat Walsh, who used to run the laborer’s union, was still alive because he would have had something funny to say about Mrs. Mahony’s modest proposal. Funny and unprintable.\n\n• \n• \n• \n• \n
WOODS HOLE — In this brainiest corner of Cape Cod, PhdDs in deck shoes and baggy shorts are a dime a dozen. If they seem to be having a little too much fun going out on research vessels to sample the water column or hatching squid and skates in giant holding tanks on shore, who can blame them? Woods Hole is a kind of summer camp for inquiring minds, and even visitors who didn’t do their high school science projects on the taxonomy of cephalopods can tap into some of that salt-air, gee-whiz excitement. This former fishing village and whaling station has evolved as a world capital of marine, biomedical, and environmental science, a place where the living ocean is a laboratory full of authentic wonders. If you decide to take a break from splashing in the sea and lolling on the sands, a series of tours and exhibits will give your whole family a peek at the action. The best day to visit Woods Hole is Friday, when luncheon and evening lectures round out the experience.\n\t\nWoods Hole started down the road to erudition in 1871, when Congress created a summer sampling station here at the juncture of the warm-water Gulf Stream and the icy Labrador Current. The lab for what is now the National Marine Fisheries Service became full time in 1875; it studies fish and shellfish resources as well as the impact of fisheries (and fishing limits) on communities. It also monitors the impact of climate change and food web dynamics on the ocean ecosystem. While those lofty tasks might sound daunting, the grand abstractions of marine science find simple expression at the Woods Hole Science Aquarium, a favorite with kids. The 140-plus species displayed make a good introduction to the small-scale denizens of the sea. At the first tank of commercially exploited species, kids are mesmerized by codfish swimming lazily around the water column — until they spot the periscope-like eyes of the flounder (shades of “Finding Nemo”) poking warily up from the gravel where it has camouflaged itself. In other tanks, Atlantic salmon line up in the current like chorus girls and gaudy lionfish flaunt their rippling manes. The popular upstairs touch tank (two fingers only, please, and no lifting) is filled with mollusks, sea stars, anenomes, and other slow-moving creatures. Bumper and Lucille , two rescue harbor seals unable to return to the wild, occupy a 17,000-gallon pool in a small plaza in front of the aquarium and steal the show during their 11 a.m. and 4 p.m. feedings. Trainers encourage them to jump through hoops, retrieve rings, and perform other tasks to make them easier to handle and to keep the intelligent creatures from getting bored.Over at the Marine Biological Laboratory\n, even bigger fish tanks are part of the draw for the hourlong tour of the independent research institution established in 1888. Class begins in a real classroom, complete with left- and right-handed desks, inside a former whale oil candle factory. “The objective here is discovery,” said our guide, engineer Joe Messina. He explained that the simplified systems of certain sea creatures provide research models to tease out more complex processes in the human body. He pointed to highlights such as the use of horseshoe crab blood to screen for bacterial contamination and the ongoing work on spinal-cord nerve regeneration using the sea lamprey as a model. Scientists are even studying the reflective mechanism in cuttlefish skin that allows the squid cousins to camouflage themselves in the wild — with hopes that it might have applications in military camouflage. “It’s a far-out one,” Messina noted, “but other far-out ones have worked out, so you never know.” After an overview video, Messina led us to the tank room, where he lifted one kind of marine life after another out of the water — horseshoe crabs, whelks and their string-of-beads egg cases, scallops, gelatinous masses of squid eggs . .\xa0. He selected two sponges that would grow together, and another pair that would grow a wall between them. They are research subjects to study the mechanisms of organ transplant rejection. Returning to the human realm, Messina took us to the library that the MBL shares with the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute. The old-fashioned stacks are filled with research journals and books in the marine and biological sciences. “They are all available in digital form,” Messina explained, “but over the years scientists have added their own research notes in the margins.” The record of evolving science captured on the pages is overwhelming — more than 50 Nobel laureates have taught, studied, or done research at the lab over the years. The tour concludes in the Pierce Exhibit Center, which highlights some of the discoveries over the years (starting with the horseshoe crab blood research) and touches on current projects. The stories are compelling — the lab’s advances may lack the flashiness of big science, but they often improve and prolong the lives of people around the planet. Established in 1930, the institute is a relative newcomer in Woods Hole. If the National Marine Fisheries Service and the lab stick largely to the local catch, the institute casts a wider net. Its vessels roam the planet, studying the oceans and ocean floor around the globe. (Neither of the large oceanographic vessels will be in port this summer.)The institute’s Ocean Science Exhibit Center trumpets achievements that blend the imagination of Jules Verne with the adventurousness of Indiana Jones. This year marks the 50th anniversary of the institute’s most famous research vessel, the Alvin, the deepest-diving manned submersible in the world. The center has a cut-away model of the interior of the vessel that can take three people for dives of up to nine hours and to depths as great as 14,800 feet. The model, complete with a full instrument panel of switches and gauges, is especially popular with teenage boys.Perhaps the most glamorous of expeditions was the 1985 discovery and mapping of the wreck of the Titanic on the ocean floor. The initial photography was done with Argo, a remote-controlled underwater vessel, and closer exploration was carried out with Alvin and another remote-controlled vehicle. More otherworldly explorations include the strange forms of sea life around hydrothermal vents on the deep ocean floor — lifeforms that depend on an entirely different chemistry than those of us who breathe oxygen and bask in sunlight. Hourlong tours, conducted mostly on the institute’s dock, focus more on the nuts and bolts of the research operation. Most of the research is done “on the wire,” guide Hovey Clifford explained as he showed us the complex sensor wires used to place instruments in the water. A trainee happened to be getting his initial session in a one-atmosphere submersible articulated diving suit (the Exosuit), so we rushed over to watch him being lowered into the water. “It’s like a wearable submarine,” said diving safety officer Ed O’Brien, explaining that the diver could descend 1,000 feet into the water and return immediately to the surface without needing to decompress. But not all research requires putting a human in the water. One ingenious device can be lowered into the water to take 12 samples at different depths. Clifford unfurled a fine-mesh sieve the size of a giant wind sock and showed us the soupy, cloudy jar of sea water it had concentrated. “Every brown dot is a plant or an animal. It would take me a lifetime to count it all,” he said. “This summer, when you’re on the beach and a wave rises up and you swallow a gulp of seawater, remember: You’re getting your protein.”The living ocean, indeed.
The  turns 23 this year, making it the oldest film festival running on Cape Cod. During that time, the festival has nurtured and energized a community of independent filmmakers, many from New England.Running July 26-Aug. 2, this year’s event boasts more than 30 narrative and documentary feature-length films and 10 shorts programs. Filmmakers-in-residence Jay Craven of Vermont and Brian Storkel of Los Angeles will conduct workshops, master classes, and panel discussions. Craven will screen his films “Where the Rivers Flow North” (1994) and “Disappearances” (2007) on July 27 at 8 p.m. Storkel’s latest documentary, “Fight Church,” about the confluence of Christianity and mixed martial arts, screens Aug. 1 at 10 p.m.\n\t\n\tThe opening night film, “The Winding Stream” (6 p.m.), is a real crowd-pleaser about American roots music royalty: the Carter family and Johnny Cash. Directed by Boston native Beth Harrington (a former member of the iconic Boston band Jonathan Richman and the Modern Lovers), it chronicles the famed Carter clan with superb historical footage and rare music clips. Musician and music writer Elijah Wald will lead a post-screening discussion and the roots band Wayworn Travelers will perform both traditional and modern renditions of Carter family songs. Screening with “The Winding Stream” is the short film “Lomax,” billed as “a spirited reimagining of folklorist Alan Lomax’s 1941 journey through the Mississippi Delta,” directed by Vermont native and 2007 Emerson College graduate Jesse Kreitzer.Strong local ties can also be found in “The Newburgh Sting” (July 27, 9 p.m.), a powerful expose of the FBI’s role in the 2009 case of four poor African-American men charged with plotting to bomb Jewish synagogues in the Bronx. The film, available for small-screen viewing July 21 on HBO, is directed by festival cofounder Kate Davis (“Southern Comfort”) and her producing partner and husband David Heilbronner. Both will be in attendance. Director-producer-cinematographer Richard Kane’s documentary “Jon Imber’s Left Hand” (July 27, 9 p.m.) is about the painter and Harvard art professor’s efforts to keep working even as he battles amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Kane’s film focuses on the project that would be this artist’s legacy (Imber died in April at age 63): portraits of 100 friends in Boston and Maine, where he had a second home. “Jon Imber’s Left Hand” is paired with another look at the creative process, “Inside Motherwell’s Dumpster,” a short film by Wellfleet- and Jamaica Plain-based filmmaker Marnie Crawford Samuelson. It follows Provincetown sculptor Mike Wright, working in the tradition of scavengers on the tip of Cape Cod, as she finds unusual pieces of painted wood in a dumpster outside Sea Barn, the former home and studio of abstract expressionist painter Robert Motherwell.“One Cut, One Life” (July 28, 7 p.m.) is the poignant collaboration between influential documentarian and former MIT film professor Ed Pincus and filmmaker Lucia Small (“My Father, The Genius”). After collaborating on the 2007 Hurricane Katrina documentary “The Axe in the Attic,” both filmmakers had faced tragedies, including the sudden deaths of loved ones and, for Pincus, a fatal diagnosis (he died in November 2013 at 75). “One Cut, One Life,” a personal exploration of how the filmmakers cope with death, has an uplifting subtext of how filmmaking itself is a way to deal with pain and loss.\n\t\n\t\nRhode Island-based filmmaker Christian de Rezendes’s inspirational documentary “Raising Matty Christian” (July 29, 7 p.m.) profiles Canton native Matthew G. Christian, who, despite being born in 1983 without a full set of arms and legs and with no tongue, managed with the support of his family to live a full, if too brief, life (he died in 2009). De Rezendes’s credits include co-directing the moving 2007 documentary “41,” about Nick O’Neill, the youngest victim of Rhode Island’s Station nightclub fire.A dramatic comedy shot entirely on Cape Cod, “Lies I Told My Little Sister” (July 31, 9 p.m.) is a showcase for Woods Hole resident and rising star Lucy Walters, who appeared with Michael Fassbender in “Shame.” Walters stars as a photographer who, after the death of her older sister, joins the family for a vacation on Cape Cod, complete with the baggage of lingering childhood conflicts with the younger sister she used to torment. Walters will attend the festival along with writer-producer Judy White and cinematographer Alex Gallitano, a native of Brookline. \n\nJust a few days after showing his short film at Woods Hole, gets another turn in the spotlight courtesy of the Cambridge-based nonprofit organizations Follow the Honey and Central Productions. On July 31 at 7 p.m., Kreitzer will screen “Lomax” and discuss his MFA thesis film “Black Canaries,” an early 1900s coal mining folktale inspired by his maternal ancestors. He is currently an MFA candidate and instructor in the Department of Cinematic Arts at the University of Iowa. The screening, at 1132 Mass. Ave. in Cambridge, is free and open to the public; donations encouraged.\n\n\n a new documentary about the young gay man who lost his life in a notorious hate crime 15 years ago, screens at the Waters Edge Cinema in Provincetown on July 31 at 7 p.m. The screening will be followed by an audience discussion with the victim’s parents, Judy and Dennis Shepard, and director Michele Josue, who was a 19-year-old film student at Emerson College when her friend Matt Shepard, a University of Wyoming freshman, was murdered by two men in Laramie, Wyo. The discussion will be moderated by the Rev. Christie Hardwick, a local minister of the Centers for Spiritual Living. All seats are $12 and proceeds will benefit the Matthew Shepard Foundation. \n\nFormer Boston Globe and NECN film critic , who died May 15 at 77, will be remembered by his friends and colleagues at a memorial service, open to the public, on Aug. 2 from 11 a.m.-1 p.m. at the Coolidge Corner Theatre. The event was organized by his daughters, Diane and Julia Carr, and is meant to “celebrate Jay by remembering his contributions to the worlds of music, drama and film criticism, as well as his mentorship and kindness to everyone,” Diane Carr said in an e-mail to the Globe.  \n\n
Three men told authorities they were injured in separate shootings early Sunday morning in Boston, according to police, adding to a rash of violent incidents in the city over the weekend.Officer Neva Coakley, a police spokeswoman, said three men in their 20s checked into local hospitals Sunday morning. The first, from East Boston, told police at about 1:30 a.m. that he had been shot near Prescott and Saratoga streets.At 2:18 a.m., another man, from Dorchester, went to Boston Medical Center for treatment of wounds he said he sustained in a shooting near Bowdoin and Olney streets.A little more than two hours later, at 4:46 a.m., a Brockton man checked into Boston Medical Center, saying he had been involved in a shooting around Park Street and Geneva Avenue.A fourth person was shot shortly before 7 p.m. Sunday  in the area of 93 Park St. in Dorchester, said police who had no further information. And another victim, a male, was stabbed in Mattapan about an hour later. Officer Neva Coakley, a police spokeswoman, said he was taken by ambulance to Brigham and Women’s Hospital but she did not know his condition.Saturday night in Back Bay, a man in his 50s was stabbed on Boylston Street at about 8:15 p.m., authorities said. Coakley said police arrested Stephen R. Gassett, also in his 50s, from Boston, and charged him with assault and battery with a dangerous weapon in connection with the stabbing. The victim suffered life-threatening injuries, authorities said. Coakley had no further details on his condition Sunday.Police also received calls about shots being fired at least three other times early Sunday morning, Coakley said. Authorities did not find any victims from those alleged shootings, on Bloomfield Street, Pleasant Street, and Howland Street, she said.Also, early Saturday morning, a man was shot and killed on Aguadilla Street in the South End.Police have not released the victim’s name, but . Detectives were investigating to see if the killing was gang-related, police said Saturday.
\nthe dithering delays plaguing Congress, the most maddening is its inability to do anything about gun violence. Nineteen months after the massacre at the Sandy Hook elementary school, which was supposed to be the turning point on gun policy, Congress has done nothing. Meanwhile, by some estimates, 50,000 additional Americans have been killed by guns. No wonder frustrated citizens are going around Congress to focus on the gun industry itself.\n is a new initiative aimed at getting individuals and institutions to divest from gun company stocks that support the manufacture and sale of assault weapons. Some 51 million Americans hold 401(k)s or other retirement funds, and it’s a fair bet many don’t know exactly what they include. Taxpayer dollars and donations to nonprofits prop up pension funds and endowments that can be invested in activities that donors don’t support. Corporate interlocks make it difficult to tease apart the trouble spots: Cerberus Capital Management, the private equity firm that controls Freedom Group — which manufactures the Bushmaster assault rifle used at Sandy Hook — also owns the seemingly innocuous Star Market, Shaw’s, and Steward Health Care System. What’s a responsible consumer to do?\n\t\nNormally I’m skeptical about boycotts as a political tactic, because with few exceptions — the antiapartheid campaign for South African divestment most notably — they can feel like spitting against the wind. But the gun divestment campaign has had some surprising successes. Last fall Rhode Island’s pension fund dumped a $20 million investment in a private equity fund with a stake in a gun distributor. That came after California’s public pension fund, the country’s largest, divested from two firearms firms. In February, Occidental College, in Los Angeles, became the first university to ban investments in companies manufacturing military-style assault weapons.Here in Massachusetts, treasurer of the state’s pension portfolio in the wake of the Sandy Hook shooting and reported that $27.8 million was invested in the gun industry — less than 1 percent of the total. As with other divestment questions, Grossman let the Legislature decide whether his office should be required to sell the firearms stocks, but a bill doing so stalled this session. Still, Grossman himself supports divestment. “These are issues of moral responsibility,” he said. “Sometimes you’ve got to stand up and speak up for Massachusetts values.”Ordinary citizens also have a role. Since the “Unload your 401(k)” campaign launched in late April, more than 10,000 people have checked their personal retirement accounts through the campaign’s website. Those who discover gun companies in their portfolios can sell, or ask their employers or unions to make different investment choices. “I believe as a consumer you do the best you can,” said Cathie Whittenburg of States United to Prevent Gun Violence, one of the campaign’s partners. Foiled by inaction in Washington, she said, investing with a social conscience “is something I can do.”John Rosenthal, founder of Stop Handgun Violence, knows how difficult it is to make a dent in the profits of gun manufacturers, but he believes there is power in numbers. “There are more of us than there are of them,” he said. “If enough of us vote with our wallets, I really think we can change behavior.”Particularly galling to Rosenthal is Cerberus, which promised just after Sandy Hook We have determined to immediately engage in a formal process to sell our investment in Freedom Group,”",

Their task: Help to clear 2 acres overrun with poison ivy, buckthorn, Asiatic bittersweet, Japanese knotweed, and other invasive species growing on Parks and Recreation Department property.Best of all for the cloven-hoofed friends, these menaces are lip-smacking delicacies.“It’s not only cute, but it makes really good sense,” said 27-year-old Jessica Muscaro, the project coordinator for the Hyde Park Green Team.Department officials said it was the first time Boston has sought the help of goats for a city project. Officials say the hairy, four-legged weed whackers represent a fast, clean, and efficient way to clear the area for green space without using herbicides or loud and polluting machinery.The four goats will live in the urban wild for eight weeks, protected by a solar-powered electric fence. People are encouraged to look, but not touch, as the poison ivy oils may stick to the goats’ coats, even though it does not harm their digestive tracts.\n\t\nTeenagers from the Hyde Park Green Team will provide water and food to supplement the goats’ diet\n, then begin pruning trees and building trails once the area cleared.“Goats are an ecofriendly way to regulate overgrowth and manage pests and weeds, while giving nutrients back to the earth,” Mayor Martin J. Walsh said in a statement.Tony Barrows, who has lived in Hyde Park for 27 years, remembered taking his young daughter to the site, alongside the Neponset River, in the 1990s. That was before the trees had been choked by the Asiatic bittersweet and the trails covered by other invasive plants.“I’d like to see some development along the river bank where people can jog, or just sit down, read a book,” he said.The $2,800 to rent the goats is being covered by grants provided to the Southwest Boston Community Development Corporation. James Cormier, owner of the Goatscaping Co. in Plympton, is providing the animals, which range from 120 to 170 pounds.\n“It would be way more time-consuming for the city to come in and start chop, chop, chopping away,” he said.The community development corporation’s assistant director, Pat Alvarez, said she came up with the idea to use goats after hearing about other cities using animals to make way for urban greenspace. Goats, sheep, llamas, and wild burros have cleared brush at O’Hare International Airport in Chicago. In Washington, D.C., goats helped clear the Congressional Cemetery in 2013.Alvarez fondly remembered being chased around her yard by a “mean” billy goat as a child.The four goats deployed in Boston were similarly mischievous Wednesday.One began to chew on a Goatscaping sign dug into the dirt, prompting Cormier to yell, “Hey, don’t eat the sign!” Another, Dalia, attempted to climb a tree before giving up.But they soon got down to business. Christophers beard flapped against his chin as he chomped on a leafy bush. Dalia’s long ears wiggled as she chewed a dense shrub to the stem. Within an hour, small sections of foliage had been cleared. \n“They’re quiet, unlike machinery,” Alvarez said. “We also think they’re going to be great ambassadors for the urban wild. Plus, they’re just fun.”""",

Sure, we must learn from other cities, but the flow of ideas shouldn’t be one-way. \nBoston can teach the world a lot about running a great city.\n When Dick Dodd crooned “love that dirty water,” Boston’s waterways were synonymous with filth. Today, the harbor and the Charles River are dazzling urban assets because a century of investment has borne fruit. The Charles River Esplanade, or Embankment as it was known, was bare when it was dedicated in 1910. At the height of the Great Depression, Helen Osborne Storrow’s philanthropy paid for Arthur Shurcliff’s landscaping; Maria Hatch donated the Hatch Shell, turning the Esplanade into beautiful, usable urban space. Today, commuting along the Paul Dudley White bike paths has become a healthy alternative to driving. Meanwhile, the emergence of the South Boston waterfront over the past 20 years goes back to the court-ordered water cleanup that started under Governor Michael Dukakis.  \n\t\n\n Private philanthropy has always been one of Boston’s best ideas, especially when it helps poor children. In 1982, the Boston Private Industry Council  and a pioneering school-improvement agreement involving the business community, higher education, and school system. Boston’s traditions in this area are deep. The Home for Little Wanderers, still an important child-care agency, started as the Female Youth Asylum in 1799. City Year was founded in Boston in 1988, and it now sends thousands of volunteers to help tens of thousands of students nationwide. \n\n Boston has a fantastic web of nonprofits performing key social functions. Across America, public housing agencies have often been dysfunctional, but since 1983, the Metropolitan Boston Housing Partnership has helped house Bostonians by rehabilitating housing and distributing housing vouchers. The Pine Street Inn is now moving from housing the homeless in temporary shelters to providing more permanent accommodation. Nonprofit groups don’t always perform better than government, but they often face more market pressure, show more flexibility, and can jar loose private money more effectively.\n\n The Boston Police Department is more effective because it gets help from ordinary citizens. The methods of community policing — the idea that cops should work with neighborhoods to solve crime and promote safety — were developed collaboratively in the 1980s, and Bill Bratton embraced those methods when he became Boston’s police commissioner. Over the decades, the department has developed the social skills so that neighborhood residents often trust them enough to tell them what’s going on, which makes for a happier city than more confrontational tactics. \n\n Boston’s Office of New Urban Mechanics devises innovations intended to improve the quality of city life. Its Citizens Connect app makes it easier to report problems. If you put Street Bump on your smartphone and put your smartphone in your car’s cup holder, then the city will automatically learn the location of potholes. Their One Card is “a school ID, a library card, and community center membership card, as well as a transit pass.” Why shouldn’t some part of government feel like a tech startup? (Disclosure: An institute that I direct has collaborated with the office on an unpaid basis.)\n\n The old model for providing some new public service, like informing straphangers about when their bus is going to arrive, is to pay millions to some connected contractor. But the MBTA broke that model when it started streaming data on the current location of its vehicles. Within weeks, an independent programmer had produced an app that made it possible to learn when your bus would show up. Today, there are a bevy of such apps, including OpenMBTA and YourBus MBTA, that are well rated and free. \n\nGreater Boston is divided into scores of fiercely independent cities and towns. In many areas, from transit planning to social services, more regional cooperation would help. But there are great benefits to living in communities small enough to empower ordinary citizens. A free-spirited Somerville can elect a truly innovative mayor like Joe Curtatone. And there is something wonderful about seeing governments compete for citizens who can vote with their feet.
Twenty-five years ago, a group of Nigerian Catholics in Boston who missed the flavor of church services in their homeland started congregating in a Mattapan apartment.Now, Nigerians in Boston and beyond are celebrating a quarter-century at their home away from home, the vibrant Nigerian parish community that grew out of those early meetings.“When we started this community .\xa0.\xa0. nobody was thinking about today,” said Augustine Onochie, who lived in that Mattapan apartment. Tears filled his eyes Saturday afternoon as he looked around St. Katharine Drexel Parish in Dorchester, full of hundreds of people who flocked there for a celebratory Mass Saturday.“I can’t believe it,” Onochie said. “Each time I open up my mouth to sing, to praise God: Tears. It’s awesome.”The Nigerian Catholic Community, based at the parish, rang in its silver jubilee with a two-hour Mass late Saturday afternoon followed by a reception in Roxbury. Two cardinals joined: Cardinal Sean P. O’Malley, archbishop of Boston, delivered the homily, and Nigerian-born Cardinal Francis Arinze of the Vatican drew cheers from people thrilled to honor someone from their homeland.The mood was joyful as the room echoed with the soaring sounds of hymns sung in Igbo and Yoruba languages. Most wore their traditional garb: brightly patterned tunics and dresses with intricate beading and shimmery threads, and for women, elaborate head wraps called “ichafu” in Igbo. They swayed and sang while a drummer hit the cymbals with flair.O’Malley wished the community a happy birthday before delivering a message about wisdom and gratitude.“We need wisdom to be able to identify what the treasure is in our lives,” he said. Immigrants “come here with great energy, great ambition, and great dreams for your children.”He asked the crowd not to lose sight of the real treasure: “your faith, your family, your relationship with God and the community,” and recalled a time when Boston’s Catholics were largely Irish and Italian.“Today we are truly Catholic, showing the world that we Catholics come in all shapes, sizes, and colors,” he said.The Nigerian Catholic Community took root in 1988 when a group of Nigerians in Boston requested permission to worship separately on Sundays. The group’s members, primarily Igbo, wanted to keep their language alive and share in their cultural identity while honoring God. The Rev. Gerald Osterman, the parish priest of what was known as St. John-St. Hugh Catholic Church, the center of Boston’s black Catholic worship, said yes.Peter Uzoma, one of the 18 people in the founding group, remembers the early days: just a few families at Mass and few donations in the collection basket. Word spread, though, and soon crowds began to come.The Boston Archdiocese recognized the community in 1989, and now, it is one of the largest Nigerian Catholic communities outside Nigeria, according to the group.“When you come here, you will not be lost,” said Uzoma, now the community’s vice chairman. “You will find something where you can contribute.”The Jubilee is a thanksgiving to God as well as a homecoming, said the Rev. Jude T. Osunkwo, a parochial vicar at the parish. “After a long period, there is need to come back home,” said Osunkwo, also the chaplain of the community. “It is a homecoming so we can land again, see ourselves and renew old acquaintances.”He said the gathering sent a message of resilience, celebrating a new homeland and honoring the old.“We have weathered storms and jumped hurdles, and we have survived as a people. We are on ground in the archdiocese of Boston,” he said.Ugochukwu Nsofor moved to the United States about a year ago, and until Saturday’s Mass, had never felt such a connection to his homeland while in America.“I can’t express it, but it gives me the feeling of if I am actually home,” the 29-year-old said after Mass. “I’ve never had that since I came. It meant so much to me.”He traveled from Newark, Del., for the service and to be blessed by Arinze.Ibipo Johnston-Anumonwo from Syracuse said she was impressed by the multigenerational, inclusive aspect of the Mass.“It was very vibrant and celebratory,” she said. “It was nice to find that true community of multiculturalism.”And Katherine Donnelly, a chaplain at Mother Caroline Academy next door, said she loved O’Malley’s homily, which she called “down-to-earth” and “one of the best.”The planning committee worked for more than a year on the event, said Ignatius Nwachukwu, its chairman. What he wanted most was to see everybody dancing at the reception afterward. With Nigerian music and food, including fried fish and a black-eyed pea pudding called moimoi, he hoped it would be a good time for all.“It’s a good opportunity to see why the Nigerians are the happiest people in the world,” he said. “In the face of abject poverty and all that, we still laugh.”
\n\n\nThe forensic teams hacked at the unmarked graves until the shovels broke, until sweat soaked their T-shirts and clouds of brown dust choked the air. They kept their eyes on the yawning pit below them, searching for the bodies of immigrants.“I see the corner,” Stevie Hope, one of the searchers, said last month as the wispy edge of a body bag curled from the ground.\n\t\nBeside her, Mary Katherine Tyler lay flat on her stomach and ducked her braided head deep into the grave. As another searcher held her legs to keep her from falling in, Tyler troweled the earth and soon found two bodies, not one.“We need another bag,” she called out.\n\n\nHe could be in the graveyard in Falfurrias or under a mesquite tree closer to the border or somewhere else entirely. Since nobody really knows, sometimes she lets herself imagine that Santos is still alive.\n\nMore than 6,000 immigrants have died crossing the southern border since 1998, according to federal records, and hundreds of them have never been identified. Typically when someone is missing in the United States, family members file a police report, an investigation ensues, and then, as hope fades, relatives provide DNA samples in case an unidentified body is found.\n\n\t\nBut the families of immigrants who go missing along the border — likely victims of exposure or dehydration — are largely shut out of this system. Because no one really knows precisely where they disappeared, there is no straightforward way for family members to file an official missing person report or to deposit a DNA profile in the FBI’s national database to match to the bodies found along the border.\nPolice often refuse to take missing person reports. Border Patrol and US Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials said they do not investigate such cases. And many families of the missing have no idea where to file reports anyway, or they fear getting deported if they contact police.As a result, hundreds of unknown bodies — including children — have been buried in Arizona and Texas, where the largest numbers of deaths are recorded.In recent years, the deaths have soared in one of the worst places for immigrants to die: Brooks County, Texas, a vast, sun-baked expanse of cattle ranches an hour north of the border on the way to Houston, a hub where immigrants can catch a ride to  anywhere in the United States. The path through Brooks County is one of the routes officials say is commonly traveled by thousands of immigrants from Central America. Santos, who crossed the border near McAllen, Texas, may well have been among them. Brooks County doesn’t have its own medical examiner. Until last year, only an elected justice of the peace declared people dead, then turned them over to funeral homes without taking a DNA sample as required by state law, partly because the county could not afford it. The funeral homes buried the dead in Sacred Heart Cemetery in the county’s only city, Falfurrias.In 2012, the number of bodies found in the brush or on roadsides in Brooks County doubled to 129, and more than half were unidentified. The next year, according to the sheriff’s department, officials discovered 87 bodies, and 44 percent were unidentified. So far this year, they have found 43 bodies.Last August, Brooks County started sending unidentified bodies to a medical examiner in another county for autopsies and DNA samples. But the only people trying to identify the bodies buried in Sacred Heart, with the county’s permission, are about three dozen college students from Baylor University and the University of Indianapolis and their teachers. They are forensics specialists who say the dead should be identified, just as nations are expected to identify soldiers who die during wars.\nIn Falfurrias, unidentified bodies are scattered throughout Sacred Heart Cemetery, but in one particular section last month, the students found corpses stuffed into body bags, rolled in blankets, or even placed in garbage bags. Baylor anthropology professor Lori Baker said one was in a plastic funeral home bag that said “dignity,” and another bag held three skulls. As many as five bodies were dumped in a single grave.Baker called the scenes “horrific” and said federal officials should have helped local governments address this problem years ago as illegal immigration surged.“It’s a total systems failure,” Baker said. “It’s a job that a medical examiner ought to do, but these counties really can’t afford to do it.”The college students paid for the trip to Falfurrias, in exchange for college credit. They say they aren’t here to take a stand on either side of the fierce divide over illegal migration; they are here in the name of simple humanity. “It’s beyond politics,” said Olivia Rowland, one of the Baylor students who volunteered to help exhume the bodies. “You still gotta agree that something’s not right.”\n\nMaria Interiano had begged her brother Santos not to return to the United States. When he first crossed illegally in 1998, he was 18 and strong. Last year, as he made his return after an extended visit home to El Salvador, he had just turned 33. He was thin and walked with a limp from a construction accident. Still, he easily found a smuggler to take him across for $6,500, half up front, and half when he arrived in Boston. “I don’t want to be in El Salvador,” he had told Maria, in a call to Boston.The \nformer laborer hailed from a hamlet in the Municipality of Agua Caliente so remote there is no mail delivery. He only had a third-grade education — growing up they didn’t have running water or electricity, much less a high school — but at 18 he had found his way into the United States and settled in Somerville. He sent money from cleaning jobs home to help his dad. His mother had died years earlier of tuberculosis.In 2001, after earthquakes devastated part of the Central American nation and made it unsafe to return, the United States granted him temporary legal residency. For the first time, Santos had a state identification card and a Social Security number. Five years later, he moved to Florida and bought a modest green house a short distance from the Gulf Coast, which he shared with Maria and her husband. He found work in construction and spent free time barbecuing and telling stories on the patio. Santos was so happy that sometimes he would pick up Maria and spin her around.But a month after he signed the mortgage on the house, Santos fell from a ladder at work and shattered both legs, ending up in a wheelchair. A doctor rebuilt his left knee, but the recovery took months.Unable to work, he lost the house.Despondent, he collected an insurance payment for his work injuries and decided he wanted to go home. He missed his father and wanted to visit his mother’s grave. He asked US officials for permission to leave the United States but left in January 2009, a month before the official letter of permission arrived.Over the next four years in El Salvador, Santos helped his father on the farm, fathered three children, and painted his mother’s tomb blue.But he grew restless in the cornfields in Agua Caliente after so many years in the United States. It was depressing to see how little had improved after the long civil war in El Salvador. The war ended in 1992, but new violence had erupted, fomented by gangs, and the country now had one of the highest homicide rates in the world.  His relationship with his girlfriend fell apart. He worried about providing for his children. Toward the end of his time there, according to his older sister, Petrona, Santos started receiving mysterious threats, written on pieces of paper tossed onto his patio, apparently seeking bribes, but  he said he did not know who sent them.Santos wanted to return to the states but, because he had left without permission, he had no legal way back.But he had braved it before, and, in May 2013, he left for Massachusetts.\n\nIn broad daylight last month near Falfurrias, a smuggler’s Jeep — the rear window spray-painted black — swerved off Highway 281 to avoid the Border Patrol. The doors flung open and everyone inside fled toward the cattle ranches, leaving behind a bag of apples and two jugs of water.Brooks County officials call these “bailouts,” and the sheriff’s office said they happen about five times a day. The sheriff has confiscated hundreds of abandoned cars and trucks, so many that the county yard resembles a used car dealership.Scattering into unfamiliar territory during a bailout is one way immigrants can get lost. And in Brooks County, with its hundreds of thousands of acres of cattle ranches, wild grasses, and empty country roads, getting lost can be deadly.“You can follow trails for days and days and days and get disoriented,” said Daniel Walden, a volunteer sheriff’s deputy. “It’s very, very hard.”Brooks County is attractive to smugglers because it is poor, littered with abandoned warehouses, and has hardly any people, just 7,000 residents in an area about the size of Rhode Island. The mostly Latino population is concentrated in Falfurrias. Besides the Border Patrol, only one sheriff’s deputy patrols the 943 square miles each shift — so little coverage that other law enforcement officers started volunteering this summer to help patrol, knocking back energy drinks to stay alert. \nThe sheriff’s department has clamored for increased federal and state aid to combat immigrant and drug smuggling and to properly handle the bodies of immigrants found dead — more than 400 since 2009. Last year, the department won a state grant to pay another county, Webb County, to conduct autopsies and take DNA samples. But Benny Martinez, chief deputy of the Brooks County sheriff’s department, said that money will run out soon.“This shouldn’t happen,” said Martinez, who earns $28,000 a year. “The government shouldn’t allow this to happen.”Since Brooks County is not directly on the border, Martinez said it has seen little of the federal aid that Congress has channeled to the front lines. But federal records show the county is squarely on a major smuggling route north. The county’s spine is Highway 281, a straight shot from the border city of McAllen to Falfurrias, where drivers can branch off toward Houston.Typically, sheriff’s officials said, smugglers drop off immigrants before the Border Patrol checkpoint on Highway 281 in Falfurrias and instruct them to hike through the ranches, often for days, to the other side of the checkpoint. Smugglers, known as coyotes, or guias in Spanish, are supposed to pick up the immigrants on the other side and take them to Houston or another destination. Some coyotes show up, but others don’t, leaving immigrants to fend for themselves.Some immigrants use GPS to find their way through the fields. And they hide in the safe houses that have proliferated throughout the county.Authorities recently found one brazen smuggler’s compound just a few steps off  the highway: a trailer reeking of urine, a cavernous warehouse, and a mattress in the backyard. A lookout perch had been built in a mesquite tree.Another hideout is in a little-traveled section of the 13,000-acre El Tule Ranch, where dozens of empty water jugs and pieces of discarded clothing are strewn under mesquite and oak trees. In one pile, someone had written directions in Spanish on tiny slips of paper, “From here to Tuxtla, take a taxi to the Hotel Plaza Chiapas,” and “From here to Acayucan, take a taxi to the Hotel Ancira, porte de Ramiro.”For many immigrants, the trip through Brooks County is unexpectedly dangerous.Officials say the land is crawling with rattlesnakes and poisonous spiders. Immigrants wear heavy clothing to guard against cactus thorns and spiky burrs, but those precautions make it easier to overheat in the hot sun. The sandy terrain makes the trek feel like hiking on a scalding hot beach.Lavoyger Durham, the manager of the El Tule Ranch, where President George W. Bush went quail hunting in 2004, said that sometimes immigrants knock on his door when they are hungry or lost.He said he gives them food and water and calls the Border Patrol, so that they don’t die on his ranch or someone else’s. Some immigrants run for the fields to continue their journey.“That’s danger,” Durham said. As a Republican, Durham said he wants the government to curb illegal immigration. But this year, he also built a water station on the ranch, marked with a flag, to help immigrants.“I’ve been accused of aiding and abetting illegals, but I don’t care,” he said, his jaw set under a cowboy hat. “The good Lord and I know what we’re doing.”On June 12, Brooks County was the scene of another bailout. Two trucks going at speeds reaching 100 m.p.h. on Highway 281 eventually came to a stop and unloaded their passengers near the Walmart in Falfurrias. The Border Patrol chased the passengers — and the drivers — into the fields and officials towed the trucks away.A volunteer sheriff’s deputy, Cameron Coleman, watched from the road as the Border Patrol swept the fields with searchlights and a helicopter hovered overhead.“They take it serious,” said Coleman. “Otherwise people will die out there. The coyotes don’t care about them.”\n\nOn June 9, 2013, Santos Interiano and 14 others were standing on the Mexico side of the southern border. He had traveled more than 1,400 miles through three countries in as many weeks, from El Salvador, through Guatemala, and north through Mexico.From his perch, he could see the United States again.He texted his sister Maria in Boston, describing his fear of the Border Patrol:\nMaria brushed flour off her hands in the kitchen of the Mexican restaurant where she worked and called her brother. He sounded ready to cross the Rio Grande. She said a prayer that he would cross safely.More than four hours later, he texted her from a hideout somewhere around the border city of McAllen. He had swum across the Rio Grande and then jumped into a truck and was driven for 40 minutes. Santos had made it into the United States.\nBut Santos quickly realized that this trip would be even harder than his last. He told Maria the smugglers had packed him into a warehouse with 105 people. He hadn’t eaten since the day before.Maria urged her brother to rest and gather his strength.\nThe next night, he told her the smugglers were feeding them once a day, at 7 p.m.  Santos worried constantly about food and water — and his telephone.Without the phone, he would be cut off from his family and anyone who could help him.\nIn East Boston, Maria felt helpless. Texas was supposed to be safer than Arizona, where she had crossed in 2001, a few months too late to qualify for the legal residency the United States granted Santos and their sister.One night during Maria’s crossing, she twisted her leg in the dark and limped in pain. She was already bleeding from long cactus thorns sticking into her arms and legs. The smugglers did not help her. Instead, they abandoned her and three immigrants from Ecuador, whose feet were too swollen to keep going.Maria’s husband refused to leave her and helped her finish the journey. He taught her how to nibble on leaves or tree branches and suck the moisture from them. But the pair could not persuade the Ecuadorans to go on with them. They last saw them laying down on some rocks.One night, Maria recalled, while trying to sleep in the mountains she looked down into a pit in the darkness and saw what looked like a collection of human bones.\n\n\nMaria urged Santos to be patient. The Border Patrol had doubled its forces over the past decade, so it was harder to move people north. And the smugglers were feeling the pressure. She and her father had heard stories of smugglers assaulting and robbing migrants, or holding them for ransom.Santos was wary of the smugglers, too, who used nicknames like Jaguar. On June 12, 2013, he warned his sister the smugglers were threatening to confiscate the migrants’ phones.The next day, he texted that the smugglers had moved a group from the warehouse, but the Border Patrol had caught them. He had been in the warehouse for days, with little food or hope of getting out.\nSantos asked Maria if a friend from Texas could come and get him, but the friend refused because he was far away — and worried about picking up someone crossing illegally. After a week in the stifling warehouse, three people fled and Santos watched as the smugglers left to find them.\n\nMinutes later, Santos texted her one more time. It was Father’s Day in El Salvador.\n\n\nThe college students were eager to go to Sacred Heart Cemetery last month. Cadavers do not frighten them. Many are budding forensic scientists; they scrutinize bones, observe bodies, and yell at the TV when true-crime shows get the facts wrong. The Baylor students showed up in Falfurrias wearing matching T-shirts emblazoned with skulls.“We’re the creepy people that people don’t understand,” joked Rebekah Cameron, a 19-year-old senior at Baylor.They were also doing work that nobody else had done.For 10 days, in 100-degree heat, the students labored in the potter’s field with shovels, trowels, brushes, and their gloved hands. The immigrants were buried in a patch of land under a few silver markers that read “Unknown,” surrounded by graves adorned with granite headstones, ceramic angels, and daffodils.\nThe effort is part of the Reuniting Families project, an organization that Baker founded in 2003 to help identify the remains of immigrants. Baker, a forensic scientist at Baylor who specializes in analyzing skeletal remains, had suspected since she was a college student that local officials were burying immigrants without trying to identify them. Years ago, she was chatting with a Texas sheriff about the lack of skeletons to work on in her college classes. He told her he had plenty of bodies of immigrants that “nobody wants.” “That’s when the hair on the back of your neck stands up and you say, ‘Really?’” she said. “Of course they have people who want them back.”\nAfter finishing her studies and landing a job at Baylor, Baker created a lab and started helping Arizona and Mexico identify remains. Then, in 2012, she organized a team to exhume bodies in Del Rio, a border town in Val Verde County, Texas. Because the graveyard was so rocky they needed pickaxes to exhume six bodies, including an infant. The next year, the group moved to Brooks County, where deaths of migrants had soared. Last year, they found 63 graves and 69 bodies. \nLast month, they hoped to find as many as possible. But the work was arduous. They could not use heavy machinery because it could damage the bodies, so all the digging had to be done by hand.\nFirst, the students scraped the top layer of weedy grass and divided the section of the cemetery where the immigrants were buried into quadrants with strings and spikes. Each team dug about a foot deep, and then carved deeper holes the diameter of coffee cans. They lowered sticks into the holes to feel for bodies, to see if they should dig deeper.Once they saw the body bags — few of the dead were in coffins — the students lay face down over the graves and gently brushed dirt off the bags. To take their minds off the gruesome work, the students told jokes or sang songs. Despite the tanks of Gatorade nearby, some grew sun-parched and nauseated and suffered headaches. A few ended up at a nearby hospital. But every day, most showed up at dawn, and some before then, to start digging by flashlight.Each time the students lifted a body from the ground, they fell as silent as pallbearers. They put the bodies in fresh bags and carried them to a shady spot under the live oak trees. They marked each one with the date and location and placed a plastic flower on top.“We’re trying to remember that they had a life and we want to get them back to their families,” said Cameron, a forensic anthropology student at Baylor. “I don’t like to leave questions unanswered. The question is, who are they? The answer is, we’re going to find out. We’re going to give them back their identity.”\n\nThe first week of July in 2013, Santos’s father in El Salvador received a phone call late at night. He stepped outside onto the patio, struggling to hear. “I’m informing you that your son Santos died,” the voice said in formal Spanish, and hung up.Santos Pineda, a 61-year-old farmer, thought it was a trick.“In three or four days, they’re going to ask me for money,” he said to himself.He went back to the farm to sow corn and beans, and then to the well to draw water. Pineda had urged his son to stay in El Salvador, but Santos said it would be better if he left. He could find work and send money home.Four days later, the same man called again from an untraceable phone. He spoke kindly, and told Pineda he could have a funeral Mass said for Santos.“Mr. Pineda,” the voice said. “Don’t doubt that your son is dead.”Suspicious, Pineda asked him how he knew for sure. The man recited Santos’ full name, the tiny hamlet where he grew up, the year he was born, 1980.The man said he had Santos’s Salvadoran identification card.“Don’t doubt it,” the man said again. “Your son died.”The man said Santos had collapsed at night under a tree, but he did not say where. Pineda asked the man to send him Santos’s identification card, but he never did.The uncertainty gnawed at Pineda. He could not sleep. He thought he heard Santos’s voice. He asked the smuggler in El Salvador for the name of the guide who was supposed to take Santos from McAllen to Houston, but she refused to provide it. Rumors abounded. A month after Santos disappeared, a man who said he had met him in the warehouse told the Interiano family the smugglers had taken Santos from the hideout on June 24, 2013; Santos did not tell his family because the smugglers allegedly confiscated his phone. The man, who called himself Luis, had called them from a borrowed phone; they have not been able to find him since.“My son was very close to me. He talked to me,” Pineda said. “I know if he was lost and he could call, he would have called me.”Pineda said the only way to know Santos is dead is to find his remains.“I’d like to have the bones of my son,” Pineda said.\n\nOn the last of the college students’ trip to Falfurrias, they hit Sacred Heart Cemetery with flashlights before dawn. One of the team leaders, Jim Huggins, a Baylor lecturer and retired Texas Ranger known as Sarge, had given them a hard deadline of 10 a.m. to finish. The night before, four of the diggers had gone to the hospital because they felt ill after working in the heat. He didn’t want anyone else getting sick.\n“Keep time on your breaks, people,” Sarge said, patrolling the edges of the pit to make sure the students took breaks and drank water.The air filled with dust. The sun burned in the sky. \n“I’m tired,” said Lindsay Bone, a Baylor senior. She bent over, touched her toes, and minutes later, was back in the hole digging.By 8:30 a.m., they thought they were almost done. But as the students dug, more bodies emerged. The 10 a.m. deadline came and went.“It’s just more and more and more,” Erica Christensen, an Indianapolis graduate student, said of the bodies.Helen Garcia spent the day digging a hole that yielded no bodies, but she said she didn’t mind. The soft-spoken Baylor student said her own parents, now US citizens living in Texas, had crossed the border illegally decades ago. The people buried here could have been people just like them, compelled by the dream of a better life.“It’s amazing what parents do to help their families, even if it means breaking the law,” she said, leaning on her shovel.By the end of the 10 days they had recovered 52 body bags, Baker said — and probably more bodies than that — but there wasn’t time to find them all. Graves are still scattered throughout the cemetery, near the edge of the road, and, Baker said, in other counties along the border.Baker said Baylor and Texas State University students and professors will clean the remains and send pieces of bone to the University of North Texas, which has a federal contract to extract DNA and upload a profile into the FBI’s DNA database.“I, and anyone else, could probably work on this until the end of our career and still not have found everyone,” Baker said. “It’s just devastating.”\n\nMore than a year after her brother disappeared, Maria Interiano had not been able to report him missing to authorities — because she hadn’t found a government agency in the United States willing to take the report.Though she is also here without papers, Maria said she would help police. Over the past year, she has called the Border Patrol, ICE, and police in Boston, Everett, and McAllen. Almost every government official referred her someplace else.According to Lucy Pineda, executive director of the nonprofit Latinos United in Massachusetts, Boston police said in February that they couldn’t take a report on Santos because he disappeared while breaking the law. \n\n\nWithout help from authorities,  family members cannot get their DNA into the FBI’s database to see if it matches bodies found in Texas or Arizona, or post a missing person report in the, a searchable public database of open cases.\nForensic specialists say cooperation from law enforcement is crucial to identifying bodies. Of the dozens of bodies Baker and her teams have exhumed in the past three years, only one has been identified so far.In Pima County, Ariz., where the medical examiner’s office obtains DNA profiles from all unidentified bodies, some 700 to 800 found since 2001 are still unidentified. The medical examiner said the FBI could work with nonprofits to get family DNA samples for its database, known as the Combined DNA Index System, or CODIS.\n\n Boston and Everett police said they investigate only cases in their jurisdiction, but said they would help connect immigrants to authorities in other states. The FBI says it will not generate a DNA profile in a case unless it is submitted by a law enforcement agency.Officials at the National Missing and Unidentifed Persons System said people searching for relatives in the United States should file reports with them. They said they will try to arrange for a free family DNA sample and a missing persons report. Maria had never heard of the national missing persons system. She and her father finally reported Santos missing to the Salvadoran government, which confirmed the report to the Globe.Through the Globe, Maria searched the national missing persons system and contacted the Webb County medical examiner’s office in Texas, which is now conducting autopsies for Brooks County, for help in finding Santos.Santos is not in the national missing persons system yet. But Maria said she has a list of clues that could help find him: He is 5’6”",

He said he would sue the league instead and then revoked the trust.The nonjury trial held over several weeks focused mainly on whether Shelly Sterling properly removed her husband as a trustee and whether her actions carried any weight after he revoked the trust.Donald Sterling’s lawyers contended that his wife and her lawyers conspired to trick him and that the mental exams by two doctors were faulty.  They said Sterling didn’t know his competency as a trustee was being evaluated and that he showed no signs of incompetence on the witness stand.In combative testimony, Sterling said he would ‘‘never, ever sell’’ the team he bought in 1981 for about $12 million. He vowed to fight the NBA in court until the day he dies.Before taking the stand, he kissed his wife and then testified that he loved her. But the following day when she approached him in court he yelled, ‘‘get away from me, you pig!’’Sterling, a lawyer who made a fortune as a landlord, has filed an antitrust lawsuit in federal court against the NBA and he sued his wife, NBA commissioner Adam Silver and the league in state court.Lawyers for Shelly Sterling and Ballmer had urged the judge to let the sale go through because it was in the best interest of the family trust. They said an auction was less likely to bring such a high price and that coach Doc Rivers, key players, and sponsors were likely to leave if Donald Sterling’s ownership was prolonged.‘‘The trust has a golden bird in the hand,’’ Shelly Sterling’s lawyers wrote in court papers. ‘‘A sale of the Clippers for $2 billion is indisputably a bonanza for the Sterling family. Donald’s strident opposition is motivated by only selfish considerations.’’Donald Sterling said he could get more for the team by also selling TV rights and through his $9 billion suit against the league.
When Lenny Johnson walked into the Neponset firehouse in Dorchester 60 years ago, the first guy to greet him was Paul Finn.“He came right over and shook my hand,” Johnson was saying. “I thought, ‘This is the kind of guy I want with me in a fire.’ Paul and I were partners from that day on.”\n\t\nPaul Finn and Lenny Johnson were part of the original Engine 20 crew. One day, 53 years ago, Paul’s wife, Rita, went into labor and called the firehouse. Lenny Johnson got on the phone with her.“I need Paul,” Rita Finn said.Lenny held the phone to his chest and told Paul to high-tail it home. Paul Finn ran up Neponset and banged a left onto Ashmont. He was home in a minute.Lenny was still on the phone with Rita when she asked, “Where is he?”“I’m right here,” Paul Finn replied, standing next to his wife.\n\t\nThey made it to St. Margaret’s just in time for the birth of Joseph. \nOn Monday, 85-year-old Lenny Johnson was sitting on a folding chair in one of the bays at the Neponset firehouse, looking at the guy who was born 53 years ago after Paul Finn ran home faster than Jesse Owens.“I held Joe in my arms, right here, just after he was born,” Lenny Johnson said. “And now look at him.”Joe Finn, the new commissioner and chief of the Boston Fire Department, was sworn in at the firehouse where his dad worked with men who fought the Nazis overseas and fires back home. He remembered them by name: Lenny Johnson, Bill Wright, Walter Hurley, Frank McKay, Johnny Howard.For Joe Finn, this was as much about coming home as it was being sworn in.“A lot of fond memories here,” he said.But it is a job where some memories hurt, like a punch in the chest.If there was any doubt Marty Walsh would make Joe Finn his chief and commissioner, it ended that day in March when the wind turned a bad fire on Beacon Street into a horrible fire. It was Joe Finn who made the call no chief wants to make, to pull everybody out of a building where two firefighters were trapped.Joe Finn saved lives that day, but on the proudest day of his professional life he went out of his way to remember the worst day of his professional life, the day that Lieutenant Eddie Walsh and Firefighter Mike Kennedy made the ultimate sacrifice. Joe Finn hired Eddie Walsh and loved him. Finn was, like Mike Kennedy, a Marine and there is a bond between Marines that is ineffable.As Joe Finn recalled the two fallen firefighters, Kennedy’s mother, Kathy Crosby-Bell, and Kennedy’s girlfriend, Sarah Wessmann, were sitting nearby and nodded in appreciation. Joe Finn saluted everybody, from firefighter to chief, who worked that fire.“To all of you,” he said, making a toast without a drink.Joe Finn’s wife, Sue, was sitting in the front row, smiling. She spent sleepless nights worrying about her husband. She does the same for their son Brandon, who works on Ladder 15 on Boylston Street, the same ladder Mike Kennedy worked on, the same ladder Eddie Walsh worked on before he made lieutenant. And she lies awake sometimes because her son Sean, a lance corporal with the Marines, is in Afghanistan.By being sworn in at the firehouse where his dad worked, around the corner from where he grew up, Joe Finn proved you can go home. But Sue Finn is a mom, and she won’t relax until her Sean comes home.
\nare used to battling their way toward groundbreaking ceremonies. There are few real estate deals in town that don’t come loaded with some form of bloodsport, whether it’s the dust-ups over building heights downtown, the brutal parking conflagrations found on every block in South Boston, or something more amorphous, like the toxic identity politics that have dogged new housing construction in Jamaica Plain. These battles pop up frequently enough that they’ve taken on the feel of a ritual dance. The contours of the conflicts feel familiar, even as the address of the field of battle shifts. At the end of the Red Line in Dorchester, Trinity Financial is staring at a far less familiar type of confrontation. Trinity’s bid to turn a scruffy Dorchester Avenue garage into a new mixed-income housing complex is loaded with guts and drama, but the battle isn’t about building permits. Trinity is picking a fight with the economics of Boston’s dysfunctional housing market. \n\t\nThe developer is trying to replace an industrial parcel outside Peabody Square with dozens of homes built for average people of average means. This shouldn’t be a remarkable endeavor, but in Boston, it is. Other developers haven’t figured out how to finance moderately priced homes in any meaningful volume. And this failure is pricing the city’s middle class out of existence. Trinity wants to raze Ashmont Tire, an automotive shop sitting across the street from the Ashmont Red Line station, and replace it with 81 housing units. This type of development — on the T, in a neighborhood outside of downtown, replacing a storefront that could go anywhere in Massachusetts with a building that works only when it’s near a rail line —  doesn’t happen as often as it should. Still, the project isn’t unique. It follows the lead of the Carruth, a six-story housing project that Trinity built across Dorchester Avenue, also next to Ashmont Station. The Carruth and the Ashmont Tire proposal are scaled similarly — five stories of housing over a ground floor of retail storefronts. They both mix subsidized affordable housing units with market-rate homes. They’re both selling the prospect of a quick commute downtown to new residents, and using those new residents to attract retailers who deepen the vitality of the surrounding neighborhood. They’re the types of buildings that should be surrounding T stations across Boston.\n Right now in Boston, there’s an enormous amount of money to be made building luxury homes. There’s also a finite, but steady, pool of money that developers tap to build subsidized housing for lower-income residents. The space in between is where the broad middle class dwells, and these days, it’s difficult to make the math work on new middle-class housing. Trinity’s new Ashmont project is slated to contain dozens of market-rate condominiums aimed at this forgotten middle. They would sell at a fraction of the price luxury units are now going for downtown. The Trinity project pulls this off by flipping the development’s internal economics upside-down. Most Boston developments tap market-rate rents to create subsidies for affordable units. Trinity’s Ashmont project leads with subsidized affordable units, which carry the costs of getting the building off the ground. By shouldering construction costs, these affordable units help pay for reasonably priced market-rate condos; the market-rate units cost a fraction of what they would cost to build from scratch on another site, and because they cost less, they don’t have to sell to high-end buyers. “There’s a dearth of housing that’s not at either end of the income spectrum, and it’s a real problem,” Trinity’s Kenan Bigby says. “We hope this type of model can go a long way to filling the gap.” 
A West Roxbury man has been arrested after allegedly raping a female fan in front of onlookers at a Keith Urban concert Saturday in Mansfield.Sean Murphy, 18, was allegedly on top of the victim on the lawn at the Xfinity Center as bystanders took photos and videos of the alleged assault on their cellphones, Mansfield police said in a statement Tuesday. Another female concertgoer pushed Murphy off the victim, before the suspect ran into the crowd, police said.\n\t\nMurphy has been charged with one count of rape, according to police. “Thanks to concerned patrons, the female victim was removed from the area and they assisted her in getting her help and reuniting her with her friends,” police said.Police responded after a concertgoer approached them at the event and reported seeing the alleged sexual assault. Bystanders in the area of the assault gave police a description of the suspect, and they located Murphy and arrested him.Digital evidence from witnesses’ cellphones documenting the alleged assault is being examined by police as part of the investigation.Murphy’s lawyer, Neil P. Crowley, said in a statement Tuesday that “This was a consensual act, not a sexual assault. There are no allegations of force or violence put against him.“This was a private act that regrettably occurred in a public place. Mr. Murphy deeply regrets this incident and I’m sure the young woman does as well.” \n\t\nMurphy has no criminal history, according to Crowley.The lawyer said the female allegedly assaulted was not under the influence of alcohol or drugs at the time. He did not comment on whether his client was sober. Officials did not give the victim’s age or release other details of the incident.Also on Saturday at the concert, eight ambulances were called to take fans to hospitals, a majority of them suffering from alcohol-related incidents. And on Tuesday night, the Xfinity Center hosted “Nine Inch Nails, Sound Garden,” an industrial-rock concert. Mansfield police said they had heard of no incidents at the concert, as of late Tuesday night.
“Maybe I need a psychiatrist,” says Donato Frattaroli, scion of the North End family behind Artu, Ducali, Filippo, Lucia, and Ward 8. “But there’s never been a day that I’ve said, ‘I need to go to work.’ When you’re with family, it’s not ‘work,’\u2009” he says.At least that’s true when a family business runs well, especially a restaurant business. After all, says Frattaroli, “Restaurants are where we meet our friends, where the kids go when they’re home from college, where we have a drink and talk.”\n\t\nIt’s not always cocktails and chatting, of course. Just consider the Market Basket saga, wherein the bickering  could derail an otherwise successful enterprise. In the best-case scenario, however, a well-run family business fosters loyalty, longevity, and a built-in support system. Donato’s nephew Philip Frattaroli, who owns Ducali, went to law school but was lured into the fold \nby his fond memories. He opened Ducali in 2008, next to his father’s restaurant, Filippo. “Being a lawyer, you’re dealing with people at the worst times. In a restaurant, it’s social and happy,” says Philip. Happier still if you can raid your dad’s fridge in a pinch — which he admits doing on occasion.It’s no surprise, then, that “on average, family companies perform better. There have been numerous studies on this,” says John A. Davis, who leads the Families in Business program at Harvard Business School. “They do a few things really right: They’re focused on delivering high-quality service, they know their product, and they have customers who last a long time.”The flip side is that family businesses are vulnerable to feuds — feuds that strangers wouldn’t bother to sustain. Nobody can push \nsomeone’s buttons like a relative, particularly where money is concerned. “Family businesses sometimes don’t have mechanisms like boards or outside advisers to enforce discipline. You can find yourself really exposed. The business will feel it, and customers can sense it. It can be very embarrassing,” says Davis.Take Watertown’s Maslow tale. In 2011, Tim Maslow returned home to revamp his father’s Watertown restaurant, Strip-T’s, after working under New York super-chef David Chang at Momofuku. The younger Maslow added  to the straightforward menu, flooring locals (and his dad, Paul) in the process. The result was a cross between a Shakespearean tragedy and a sitcom. “The first couple of months, he quit three times,” says Paul Maslow. “And he was living at my house. You can imagine how much tension there was. There was a point when I was crawling into bed saying, ‘What have I done?’\u200a”\n\t\nUnlike many family businesses, there was no succession plan for the Maslows. “If we’d gone to a professional who deals with family businesses, they would have killed us,” says Paul Maslow. The elder Maslow fretted about alienating longtime staff and regulars with his son’s food; Tim craved creative independence. They tangled. “When I first saw his menu, I freaked out,” Paul recalls. “I said, ‘This is too much for Watertown! You cannot shock people like this.’\u2009” Oh, but he could. Today, the father-son duo thrive. The revamped Strip-T’s and the Maslows’ 2013 Brookline venture, , have earned accolades. Tim does the cooking; Paul handles things back at the office.The Maslow moral: New generations can push elders to consider fresh ideas, perhaps even saving the business. Paul Maslow had considered selling Strip-T’s until his son arrived.Donato Frattaroli appreciates such fresh perspectives. “We’ve made small adjustments to our menus as time goes on, thanks to the younger generation,” he says. “Thirty years ago, nobody knew truffles. Now everybody wants truffles. Years back, nobody ate razor clams. Now everybody eats them,” he marvels. Innovation is important, but new generations also maintain a connection to the past. No Name Restaurant has existed in the Seaport for nearly 100 years, long before it was an expense-account playground. The restaurant was once a stopover for fishermen who needed a place to cook their catch, and it hasn’t changed much, thanks to its regular customers and loyal staff. Today, Anastasia Contos operates the restaurant founded by her grandfather, alongside other family members. “Every business needs to evolve, but with a family business, you know you have something that’s worked for a long time. We toy with changes, but we also don’t want to alienate our core customer base,” Contos says.Donato Frattaroli agrees. “You have to make changes slowly. You have customers who’ve come into your restaurant for 40 years, and they come for a purpose. They know what they like, and they know what kind of service to expect,” he says.To this end, Contos keeps the same intense hours that her dad and granddad once did. “My dad took 10 days vacation in my life. If I take three days off a year, I feel like I’m cheating. It’s how we are,” she says.This ingrained work ethic also serves food industry kids well if they decide to leave the dynasty. Steve Napoli grew up on Acton’s Idylwilde Farms, run by his father and uncles. “I’d go on 4 a.m. runs with my dad to buy fruit and vegetables in Chelsea,” he remembers. “There were wholesalers selling everything from carrots to raspberries. My dad taught me how to buy. I was 10 or 11. It was exciting and dark. I met people I know to this day.” Which proved useful, since now he brings a touch of Idylwilde to the South End with his Snap Top Market, which opened in 2012. He says his father, Idylwilde co-owner David Napoli, was supportive. “We were standing out looking over Idylwilde when I told him my plans. He was jacked for me. He said, ‘Go for it. I respect it. You’ll do great things,’\u2009” says Steve Napoli.Softening any blow is the fact that other Napoli siblings and cousins — only those who are interested, of course — are primed to take over Idylwilde from their parents. “The kids call the meetings now. But we’ve all been healthy, knock on wood, so you’re not going to get rid of us that easily,” says Steve’s uncle, Rich Napoli.He pauses. “And, you know, I still think they rely on us a little bit.”\n\n\nIsland Creek Oyster Bar’s Tom Schlesinger-Guidelli, who grew up in his uncle Chris Schlesinger’s former restaurant, East Coast Grill: “Not being above anything — even picking up stuff off the bathroom floor!” \n\nDonato Frattaroli, whose family members helm numerous North End restaurants: “Restaurants are like wives: You can only have one at a time.”\n\n\nEmily Brophy, who works at New England Soup Factory with her parents, owners Paul Brophy and Marjorie Druker: “Leaving any personal problems at the door.”\n\nRich Napoli, who runs Acton’s Idylwilde Farms with his siblings: “We have very understanding mates.” \n\nChristopher Lin, who runs Roslindale’s Seven Star Street Bistro with his wife, Michelle Lin, and his father, Joseph Lin: “My dad has been doing some dishes since the 1970s, but he’s always open to making improvements.”\n\n\nDante de Magistris, who co-owns Dante and Il Casale restaurants in Belmont and Lexington (see review on Page 14) with his brothers: “My dad likes to come in and tell me what’s good and what’s not. If I can make him happy, I can make most people happy.”\n
Lower alcohol pours are the darlings of the summer season, showing up on a patio table or picnic blanket near you. Where typical bottles range from 12 to 14 percent or higher, lower alcohol wines — those containing 11 percent ABV (alcohol by volume) or less — are lighter on their fermented feet. If you are looking to experiment beyond familiar favorites like vinho verde from Portugal or txakoli from Spain’s Basque region, there are delightful options. We suggest three whites and a quite fizzy pink from producers who apply tradition and craft to master the naturally occurring sugar in grapes, an essential step to taming alcohol levels.\n\t\nCrushed grapes and their resulting juice, called the must, begin their journey of becoming wine when yeast converts sugar to ethyl alcohol (also called ethanol) through fermentation. Riper grapes contain more sugar, and those higher sugar levels can translate into stronger, more alcoholic wines when yeasts are allowed to consume all of that sweetness. One method of creating a lower alcohol wine is to halt fermentation, leaving residual sugar in. A well-made sweet example is a 2012 Chateau Ste. Michelle “Harvest Select” sweet riesling from Washington State. The back label features a helpful scale indicating that this quaff will taste medium sweet, just shy of very sweet, and registers at 10.5 percent ABV. But not all wines containing residual sugar taste sweet. We found an ingenious 1 liter bottle from Slovenia, a 2013 Crnko “Jarenincan” (pronounced “churnko yarn-een-chan”), which features a field blend of white grapes —  laski riesling (welsch-riesling), sauvignon blanc, and ravenec (muller-thurgau) — grown in the same vineyard and then fermented altogether. This wine, which clocks in at 10 percent ABV, contains residual sugar but you would never know by tasting it. The tug and pull between high acid and residual sugar achieves an overall effect of perfumed fruitiness rather than overt sweetness.A completely dry white wine from France’s Loire region reminds us that not all varietals achieve high sugar content, even at their ripest, so there are natural limits to how much alcohol they can yield. Producer Domaine de la Bregeonnette vinifies folle blanche, a white grape grown near the mouth of the Loire River in Nantes, at cool temperatures to achieve a lovely, minerally quaff with just 11 percent alcohol.Sixth generation winemaker Elie Renardat-Fache bottles a sweet sparkling rose — a petillant naturel, or “pet-nat” for short — from gamay and poulsard grapes in the tiny French region of Bugey, between Lyons and Geneva. This bubbly, blushing pink is made in the “ancestrale” method, where partially fermented wine continues its fermentation in the bottle. It retains a good amount of sweetness and achieves just under 8 percent alcohol. At that level, we’re not surprised that it’s known in the region as “breakfast wine.” It is refreshingly sweet and delicate, like a grapey mimosa, perfect for brunch.\n\t\nWhen your friends hear you’re pouring these bottles, they’ll beat a path to your patio.\n This delightful pink sparkler offers frothy juiciness along with inviting notes of yeast and raspberry on the nose. Barely loosening the cage around the cork led to an explosive pop on our bottle, so take care. Bubbles settle quickly into frizzante-like softness, sweet with wild strawberry. 7.5 percent ABV. Around $24. At The Wine Bottega, North End, 617-227-6607; Curtis Liquors, Weymouth, 781-331-2345.\n Don’t let the crown cap closure fool you because this 1 liter bottle is not carbonated. That cap signifies an easy-drinking, mostly still, white quaff. Acid and residual sugar pull one another into balance, suggesting more floral and yellow fruit than sugary sweetness. 10 percent ABV. Around $18. At Berman’s Fine Wine & Spirits, Lexington, 781-862-0515; Streetcar Wine & Beer, Jamaica Plain, 617-522-6416.\n Appearing lightly viscous in the glass, this pale-hued white offers an unexpected whiff of petrol (which we adore, sometimes lacking in other New World rieslings). The palate is sweet, but skillfully balanced with acid and peach-pit bitterness that keeps dried apricot flavors from becoming cloying. 10.5 percent ABV. About $13. Cambridge Wine & Spirits, Cambridge, 617-864-7171; Burlington Wine & Spirits, Burlington, 781-272-3889.\n\n\n  Cool minerality on the nose, suggesting green apple and citrus skin.

1628,Hickman,"“It shows strength of character and his determination to accomplish something,’’ and the two-day PMC ride “is very hard,” said his father. \n\t\n“I mean let alone a 16-year-old .\xa0.\xa0. anybody to try to go out and ride 192 miles is a tough challenge.”But Jack is willing to tackle any challenge that comes his way, and \npedaling his way from Sturbridge to Provincetown will  pale in comparison with the struggles that he has overcome.In 2006, Jack broke his left femur while kicking a ball in a soccer game. After doctors examined the X-rays at Norwood Hospital, he was sent to Boston Children’s Hospital, where it was confirmed that he had a tumor in his leg. He was diagnosed with osteosarcoma, a form of bone cancer.“It’s devastating to hear that your child has cancer, and it just opens up a world of unknowns,” said Vincent. “Unfortunately there aren’t immediate answers, you’re having to wait hours and days for test results to come back, and so in the meantime, you’re prepping for the worst and hoping for the best.”The diagnosis left Jack baffled and confused, he said, recalling that he “didn’t really understand what it was. I wasn’t thinking it would be anything long-term.”He went through three months of chemotherapy, until doctors decided they would have to remove a portion of the leg. They performed rotationplasty surgery: A section of his leg from mid-thigh to the shin was removed, and then his left ankle was rotated and attached to his thigh, and now serves as his knee joint.He then went through four more months of chemotherapy  before the road to recovery began. After a year of physical therapy, in which he relearned how to walk, run, and maintain balance, Jack returned to the baseball diamond, which served as a haven for him.“It definitely shows how strong he is,” said Elizabeth Manning. “He’s always been very competitive since he was little, before he got sick, so it definitely helped him get through this and get back into sports, and be so successful at everything.”Now heading into his junior year at Roxbury Latin School, he serves as a pitcher and third baseman for the Foxes, and plays linebacker for the football squad. He plays town basketball in the winter, is an avid snowboarder, and, of course, has developed a passion for biking.Jack began training for the PMC with his father in the early spring, starting off with 10- to 15-mile rides, and has worked his way up from there.Billy Starr, founder and executive director of the PMC, says Jack’s perseverance and his family’s compassion perfectly represent what the event is all about.“It is a typical story in how the PMC can help elevate everybody’s role in an individual struggle,” said Starr, who established the fund-raiser for the Jimmy Fund at Dana-Farber  in 1980. “I mean, what could be more normal than to ride your bike? It’s a great statement for Jack to be able to make.”Last year, the PMC raised $39 million, accounting for approximately 60 percent of the Jimmy Fund’s annual revenue.Over the last five rides, the Mannings have raised well over $50,000; as of Monday, they were well on their way to meeting this year’s goal of $17,200, according to the Team Jack page on the PMC website.Elizabeth says the support “has been amazing, and we’ve been so grateful for it. We just get contributions from people we barely know or don’t know or haven’t heard from in years, and people who can’t afford to give us money.”One of their top supporters on multiple fronts has been Jack’s prosthetist, Mike Amrich.\nAmrich has known the family since Jack was diagnosed eight years ago, and rode for the team last summer. He is no stranger to the disease, either; his twin sister, Michele, died of thyroid cancer in 2008, the same illness that his wife Shelagh is currently battling.“He is just a really strong-minded and just a great kid,” said Amrich. “When I first met him he had no hair, he was a frail small boy. .\xa0.\xa0 To watch him get stronger and healthier has been great.”Not only did Jack gain back his health and strength, he has served as a mentor to other kids battling similar cancers. On occasion he will travel into Children’s Hospital and speak to patients.“Usually they just like seeing what I can do because they’re worried,” said Jack. “But I just tell them that they can do whatever they want; they just have to go through all the steps. The physical therapy is very important.”And now he will further serve as an inspiration, as he takes on the biking challenge on Saturday and Sunday. He will ride on the four-member team, along with Dave Kaple, a family friend and triathlete from Arizona, and his uncle and, of course, his father.“We’ve looked forward to it the whole year, so I’m glad I can share it with him,” said Jack. “He’s wicked good at it, too. I’m a little nervous he’s going to be way ahead of me, but it’ll be fun.”But his dad will be by his side the whole time. He’s been awaiting this moment, and plans to spend every second of it with him.“I can’t wait to watch him experience the PMC through his eyes and just being a part of it,” said Vincent. “For the past four years, he’s been at the rest stops, at the finish line, and helping raise awareness and cheer and support us, but this year he’ll be there, and I just think it’s going to be an energizing and uplifting experience for him .\xa0.\xa0. one that I think will have a positive impact on him and everyone around him.”
\n\n\n “I am a champion/ And you’re gonna hear me roar.” That’s Perry flexing some muscle on last year’s “Prism,” her third studio album that wasn’t quite a commercial juggernaut, but still showed a strong effort by the pop star. Perry comes to town for a two-night stand that will skim the new album while dipping into her other inescapable hits, from “Hot N Cold” to “Teenage Dream.” Capital Cities open. \n\n\n Before you even ask, the answer is: No, she doesn’t have a new album yet. Hill has been dogged by that inquiry — a plea, really — since releasing her last studio album, 1998’s hip-hop classic and Grammy winner “The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill.” While fans continue to wait for new music, Hill has enlivened her back catalog with updated and sometimes startling rearrangements of her songs, both as a solo artist and with the Fugees. \n\n\t\n\n Pitched somewhere between sultry Vegas nightclub act and Wanda Jackson on the 1950s rockabilly circuit, this Irish singer spits fire on her forthcoming album, “Tribal.” A new mother, May defies expectations and lets loose on her latest, burning low and slow one minute and burrowing deepinto her punk influences the next. \n\n A pioneer who’s now old enough to be taken for granted, 77-year-old Dale is a guitar god whose disciples who still hold him in high esteem for his 1960s work as the “King of the Surf Guitar.” Born in Boston, he regularly sets up shop at the Middle East, surveying his long career that stretches from “Misirlou” to more recent forays into a heavier sound that borders on hard rock. Local hellbillies Three Day Threshold open. \n\n\n\nA nicely packaged lineup of music on tap: headliners Spirit Family Reunion bring old-time and gospel fervor and racket; New Orleans’ the Deslondes, soon to release their debut album, offer their iteration of country-soul; New York-based folk singer Willy Gantrim plays alone with his guitar. \n\nThe former (and, who knows, future) American Music Club fulcrum returns to spread another round of his sly, exquisite gloom. He’ll be accompanied by fellow AMC member Bruce Kaphan on pedal steel guitar and Patrick Main on piano. Thalia Zedek opens. \n\nHis 2005 hit “Honky Tonk Badonkadonk” notwithstanding, Trace Adkins is at a point in his career where he provides an elder-statesman alternative to the predominance of bro-ness in today’s mainstream country world. And whatever he’s singing, his seemingly fathomless baritone is always a marvel. \n\n\t\n\nBoston-based but with members hailing from around the world, this Afro-pop outfit will be bringing its swirling dance grooves and socio-political lyrical messages to the Lizard for “African Music Night” each Tuesday in August. The band will be joined by a special guest each week; first up, some Zimbabwean Rhumba from the Portland Rhumba Project. \n\n\nThe acclaimed jazz vocalist possesses an agile, attractive voice and the ability to sing in six languages, animating American standards as well as French, Brazilian, Argentine, Mediterranean, and even Japanese songs. \n\nThe 22d edition of the venerable blues bash features some of the finest groups around: Fat City Band, Lloyd Thayer, Johnny Barnes & the Nightcrawlers, Johnny Hoy & the Bluefish, Rosemary’s Baby Blues Band, and Lil Ed Williams. \n\nBerklee College of Music and Boston’s ParkARTS present the annual “Jazz at the Fort” concert, this year featuring accomplished alto/soprano saxophonist Shaw, Berklee alumnus and current member of bands led by Tom Harrell and Roy Haynes, in a rare appearance with his own group. \n\nThis remarkable trio features electric bass legend Swallow and dynamic drummer Adam Nussbaum with classically trained composer, arranger, and tenor saxophonist Talmor. Their imminent release, “Singular Curves,” is an adept addition to the tradition of two of the format’s great masters, Sonny Rollins and Lee Konitz (a frequent Talmor collaborator). \n\n\n\nBoston Lyric Opera visits Ozawa Hall (July 31) with a fully staged chamber version of Jack Beeson’s opera “Lizzie Borden,” conducted by David Angus and directed by Christopher Alden.

When Justine Sterling’s kitchen counters were no longer ample enough to accommodate her children’s arts and crafts projects, the Melrose interior designer decided to transform the basement of her 1920s Colonial into a studio for her budding artists. While Sterling and her husband had thought little about converting the basement into living space in the past, it was a very viable option. “It’s a walkout basement with two windows providing decent light, and it was partially finished,” says Sterling. “While it had a couple of plaster walls covering the foundation walls, it was very ugly with exposed pipes, a horrible acoustic tile ceiling, and old sticky vinyl flooring.”\n\t\nAt roughly 450 square feet, there was a good amount of space to create a project room for Sterling’s children, Ruby, 6, and Reid, 3. “We don’t have a playroom in the house, and I felt we could create a fun, functional place for the kids to hang out in.” To keep costs down, Sterling, who created CAD drawings of the layout, took on the role of general contractor, and worked closely with a carpenter to carve out the space.The 8-foot drop ceiling made the space feel confining, so Sterling had the ceiling tiles removed. While there’s no sound buffer now and you can hear what’s going on upstairs, the space feels much more open and airy, and the newly exposed rafters have an attractive loft-like feel. Several black industrial-style Ikea pendant lights hang in between the rafters. After the tile was removed, Sterling devoted a bulk of the budget to having an electrician remove unnecessary wiring. “There was a lot of redundant wires, it looked very ugly,” says Sterling. The necessary wiring was spray painted white, along with the ceiling. The concrete floors are clad with faux wood vinyl planks that have the look of bleached oak. A floating floor, which means that the planks attach to each other rather than the sub-floor, it won’t be affected by the moisture basements are prone to.“The space needed to reflect our personal style,” says Sterling, who selected a neutral palette — black and white are the prominent hues — in keeping with the aesthetic of the rest of the house. Sterling, a South African native, favors infusing spaces with various textures and patterns for character and dimension. Overscaled graphic wallpaper by Wolf-Gordon adds flair to the staircase wall. “It’s a kid-friendly pattern, but it’s a little sophisticated too. I didn’t want to feel like you’re walking into a kid’s bedroom,” says Sterling. Yet it’s clearly a lively children’s workspace. Reid and Ruby’s artwork—hung from Ikea picture rails and curtain rods with clips — fills the room with vibrant color. In this electronics-free zone, the kids paint, draw, and play games at their white craft table. The chairs bring in a South African touch. A modern take on Riempie chairs, they were part of a collaboration between West Elm and South African design studio Source. \n\t\n“The kids are now able to spread out and be creative,” says Sterling. “It’s really nice for them to be able to see their work hanging up, too.”\nBesides creating a place for the kids, Justine Sterling realized that the basement space could solve some of family’s increasing need for a place to store shoes and coats by creating a mud room niche.“It made a lot of sense to put a mud room here — we enter the house not through the formal center entry, but through the back door that opens into the basement,” says Sterling. After careful measuring and examination of Ikea’s various cabinetry lines, Sterling found that this system from the kids’ line best fit the space, with about a half inch to spare. The cabinets and roll out drawers to the right are for Sterling and husband; Ruby and Reid keep their shoes and coats on the left. “The kids are really good about putting their stuff away as soon as we walk in the door now,” says Sterling who had a custom cushion made for the bench. “A mix of high and low materials adds personalization and keeps the space from feeling cheap.”
You can take the mayor out of the Legislature, but apparently you can’t take the Legislature out of the mayor.In a gobsmacking display of blinkered vision, Mayor Marty Walsh of former Probation Department chief John O’Brien on Tuesday, calling the case “bizarre” and the guilty verdict “a sad day for Massachusetts.”\n\t\n\n, Walsh said he thought O’Brien was not guilty of a crime — that the jury got it wrong. Walsh trotted out the same argument defense lawyers tried: Helping people get jobs is what everybody does, including legislators and even judges. In other words: everybody is guilty, or nobody is. Nothing to see here, folks! Walsh called O’Brien a good guy who got caught up in the system. He made it clear he reads the verdict personally, as a criticism of legislators — “easy targets” — complaining, “That’s why people don’t stay in politics today.”Oh, brother. I love that this mayor can’t help but answer a question honestly. But this answer? It drives me batty that he and so many Beacon Hill types see what O’Brien did as just politics as usual. When actually, what he did was — and now it’s official — criminal. I’ve said this a gazillion times, but once more, for the mayor: Probation jobs aren’t like jobs shelving books in a library or working metal detectors in a courthouse. The scheme over which O’Brien presided made a mockery of a profession that is on the front lines of our criminal justice system. Great probation officers keep offenders out of jail, moving them off destructive paths and onto productive ones where they’re contributing to society, rather than terrorizing it. The best probation officers save not just money, but lives. The job requires immense skill and dedication. But under O’Brien, candidates with that skill and dedication were repeatedly passed over for politically connected ones, some of them abysmally underqualified. He and his underlings established a sham hiring process, faking it to make it look like their preferred candidates were the most qualified.  \n\t\nThey lied because they didn’t really care about the work. While others in the justice system were busting guts to be more effective, O’Brien’s probation department could not have been less interested. They collected no meaningful data. The only numbers that mattered were how many favors were done for the legislators who held their purse strings. Good people paid for all of this. Exhibit A: Dee Kennedy. Fluent in Spanish, with two master’s degrees, decades of experience, and a gift for innovation, Kennedy should have been a probation commissioner’s dream. When the chief probation officer’s job came up in the West Roxbury courthouse, the top judge there urged O’Brien to appoint Kennedy. Instead, he chose James Rush, the elderly father of a state legislator. Rush’s two-year tenure was an epic disaster, ending with a sex- and race-discrimination suit. Kennedy finally  after O’Brien resigned. Who knows how many others suffered because of the scheme, including probationers who might have stayed out of trouble if the team in the West Roxbury courthouse had been better led?The mayor has worked with enough probationers and others on the edge to know how important the work is. Which is why it boggles the mind that he would defend O’Brien. As he said himself in the same radio interview, “You can’t have a rigged system; it has to be clearly above board.”Yet he just can’t seem to take off his legislator hat to see how rigged the system was, and how his city, and state, were hurt by it. 
""After leaving a South Boston courthouse where he came face-to-face with the Hyde Park man accused of killing his son, the Rev. Moses J. Taylor Sr. on Thursday decried the violence gripping society and expressed compassion for the family of the alleged shooter.“It affects every family,” said Taylor, who wore a sweat shirt bearing the phrase, “Families against guns and violence.”\n\t\n“You go to the schools, they have metal detectors. You can’t go to the mall without shootings. You can’t go to the movies. You can’t sit on your front porch. You can’t do anything,” said Taylor, pastor of the Anointed Church in Dorchester.Inside South Boston Municipal Court, a prosecutor alleged that Taylor’s 23-year-old son, Daniel, was fatally shot by his colleague, Marquis Smith, after they started arguing while driving from a work-sponsored party on Feb. 22.Daniel P. Taylor gave Smith, 23, a ride after leaving a party at Jillian’s Boston, said Assistant District Attorney Jennifer Hickman.Taylor and Smith worked for VPNE Parking Solutions, which provides valet parking at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Hickman said. The valet company didn’t return messages on Thursday. While driving from the party, Taylor picked up another colleague, who didn’t attend the work function, and a fourth person, Hickman said. When they got to Boston Street, Taylor and Smith discussed where to drop Smith off, but sometime after midnight an argument erupted, she said.\n\t\nThe dispute came to a head at the intersection of Boston and Howell streets, where Hickman said Taylor stopped his car, got out, and removed Smith from the front passenger seat.A fight lasting about 15 minutes ensued, during which “there was a lot of yelling; there was some shoving; there was some pushing,” Hickman said.As Smith was walking in front of DJ’s European Deli & Market at 120 Boston St., Hickman said,  he turned around and shot Taylor multiple times before fleeing toward Andrew Station with the murder weapon.The fatal shots were fired at about 12:42 a.m. on Feb. 23 and Taylor was pronounced dead at Boston Medical Center at 1:01 a.m., according to a police report filed in court. Hickman’s statement drew cries of disagreement from more than a dozen people who packed into the courtroom to support Smith. Some of his backers called out, “Love you, bro” and “Bro, you good,” as they left the courtroom, but they declined to speak with reporters.After Smith was arrested on Wednesday at his workplace, he told investigators that Taylor dropped him off at his girlfriend’s house that night, Hickman said. “Mr. Smith told investigators that he only learned of Mr. Taylor’s death that next morning when someone called him,” she said. When presented with evidence in the case, Smith allegedly responded: """"I don’t know. I was drunk. I don’t remember anything,”",

It was published by Ecco, which is a safe bet. They published my favorite book of the past five years.\n: What was that?\n: “The Son” by Philipp Meyer, a big, rich book that takes on the big, rich themes of this country. It reminded me of early Cormac McCarthy. Clean, rich, muscular, the kind of writing I respond to the most. I only had 100 pages to go, and my dog Rosie ate my copy. \n: Has this dog eaten other books?\n: This is my second white English bulldog, and they both have been crazy and had incredible tastes in books. My previous one, Stella, ate Brad Watson’s “The Heaven of Mercury,” and the next day it got nominated for the National Book Award. She also ate a Toni Morrison book and an Edith Wharton book. Stella wouldn’t even look at a James Patterson.\n: When you went to Boston College High School did you read anything that had a big impact on you?\n: F. Scott Fitzgerald’s “The Great Gatsby.” Tom Perrotta and I talked about how every writer we respect names it as the book. It just casts a shadow over the 20th century. \n: Did growing up in Dorchester shape you as a reader in any way? \n\n: Yeah because no one did it. You’d get beat up pretty quick for it. I was in the midrange of popularity, but I took it down a notch by sitting in the back of the classroom and reading. The nuns told my mother that I read well past my age level, which was the only nice thing they ever said about me. So my mom got me a library card, and it changed my life.\n: Is there a book that really captures Boston?\n: I don’t think anyone’s written a comprehensive Boston book. Some do a great job of capturing a time period, such as J. Anthony Lukas’s “Common Ground” about the city’s school desegregation. \n: Given your Irish background have you read a lot of Irish writers?\n: It’s never been like I got to blow through all of James Joyce, though I did. The books that have spoken to me have been Irish-American, specifically William Kennedy’s books. Reading Kennedy was like going home. Once when I was in Albany, N.Y., I got lost, but from reading all his books I knew to look for the major streets, which is what I did.AMY SUTHERLAND
\n\nHe opens up Tinder, a meetup app on his iPhone, swipes through several women’s pictures and profiles, and selects the ones he might be interested in. If someone reciprocates, he has a date — no texting or suave moves necessary. Caloggero, 31, a machinist with General Electric, says he hopes to eventually find a girlfriend using the app, though he also considers looking fo\n\n\t\nThat ability to find a sexual partner with a few taps on a phone screen has raised concern among health officials and physicians, who say these meetup apps, more commonly known as hookup apps — which use geo-location to connect people with potential partners who live close by — may be partially responsible for a rise in common sexually transmitted infections.\nIn Boston, health officials have seen chlamydia climb among 15- to 24-year-olds, especially in communities of color, said Dr. Anita Barry, director of the Infectious Disease Bureau at the Boston Public Health Commission. From 2009 to 2012, the rate of infected Boston residents in that age group increased 10 percent, to 220 cases per 10,000 people.\nHealth officials know they will not stop people from using meetup apps, which also include Pure and Hinge and have millions of customers. Instead, they hope to use the mobile platforms as a way to spread public health messages about safe sex and testing for sexually transmitted infections. The commission has yet to perform a study on the risks associated with the use of hookup apps, but anecdotally, many of those infected use the apps to find sexual partners, Barry said.\nThe apps are “making it much easier to find a ready-and-willing partner who might be right in their area,” Barry said. “Sometimes, in that social network, there’s a higher baseline prevalence of sexually transmitted infections, so you don’t even have to have that many episodes of sexual contact to get infected.”\n\n\t\nPeople who use hookup apps tend to have more sexual partners, Barry said, also elevating the risk of infection. Even though many of these people would be likely to have multiple partners anyway, the apps have made finding sex so easy that it fuels the rapid spread of infection, she said. A study published in June in the journal Sexually Transmitted Infections found that gay men who used smartphone apps to find sexual partners, when compared with men who found partners online or at bars and clubs, were more likely to contract a common sexually transmitted infection, including gonorrhea and chlamydia.\nAnother study, published in January in the scientific journal PLOS One, found that gay and bisexual men who used smartphone apps reported having more sexual partners and had a higher prevalence of sexually transmitted infections than men who met partners in other ways. While the studies suggest a link between app use and the risk of contracting sexually transmitted infections, they do not blame the apps for the rise in number of infections. \nry said.\n“Health education has to evolve, just like people’s use of apps is rising,” said Dr. Kenneth Mayer, founder and medical research director at Fenway Health, a health care, research, and advocacy center for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people in Boston.\nDavid Novak of Online Buddies, a Cambridge-based social networking company, said mobile apps are not to blame for riskier sexual behavior or rising rates of sexually transmitted infections. There has not been enough research, he said, to determine whether they significantly affect sexual health. Online Buddies, which owns gay dating sites and apps, said it promotes safer sex and testing through banner ads on its apps. “That’s the brilliance of mobile apps. You can push messages out to certain cohorts and populations,” Novak said. “This is a captured population of just gay and bisexual men, which are sometimes difficult to reach.” He added that health officials can also reach black and Latino men who have sex with men through their apps, both of which are high-risk populations that often do not get tested for sexually transmitted infections or visit health clinics. \nese resources are available.”",

2136,Cindy Emefa Coffee,"""""",
2137,Franklin,"""\n\nFor months, Cindy Emefa Coffee had planned a research trip to Ghana, on Africa’s west coast. There, the Wellesley College junior would explore turning organic waste into animal feed, a process that could aid one of the world’s poorest regions.But then the Ebola epidemic struck, killing people by the hundreds just a few countries over from Ghana. Would Coffee, 21, remain in Massachusetts, or head to Africa?\n\t\nShe went.\n“Yes, I did have concerns,” she said in a telephone interview last week from Accra, the capital of Ghana. “But I don’t regret being here.”But while some students and their colleges are sticking with long-scheduled academic travel to Africa, other colleges are canceling trips there.A group of medical students and faculty from the University of New England in Maine scrapped plans to go to Ghana last week. The University of Illinois suspended its fall study-abroad program in Ebola-stricken Sierra Leone and said it would rigorously screen students returning from Western Africa.Harvard University administrators issued an advisory last Friday urging students and staff members to avoid all but essential travel to the three countries at the epicenter of the outbreak —  Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia.\n\t\nThe letter from Harvard’s provost said that anyone affiliated with the university who in the past four weeks visited those three nations or Nigeria, which has a small number of cases, should contact the school’s health services office for a telephone assessment before returning to campus. More than\n\n1,000 people in West Africa have died from Ebola in recent months, and last Friday, the World Health Organization declared an international public health emergency.The worst Ebola outbreak in history has emerged as US universities prepare to dispatch students for study abroad during the fall semester.\nBoston College has two students bound for Ghana. Tufts University has seven students studying there for the fall semester, said Sheila Bayne, director of the universitys study-abroad program. They arrived late last month and will stay until December.Two other Tufts students took leaves of absence to do research in Senegal, she said. Senegal shares a border with one of the affected countries, Guinea, but has not reported any Ebola cases.Tufts students in Ghana have not expressed concerns to administrators, Bayne said. Only one parent responded to an advisory Bayne e-mailed students and their families, thanking Bayne for the note and letting her know her son was safe.“People realize that the disease is at present contained,” Bayne said. “We’re hoping that it stays  that way.”Coffee spoke with relatives and academic advisers, including project coordinators at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, before deciding to go ahead with research in her native Ghana. She went amid assurances from university administrators that they are closely monitoring medical reports from western Africa.\nSince arriving last week, Coffee has driven up and down the country, through cities and the countryside, carrying a supply of hand sanitizer and aerosol disinfectants everywhere she goes, even though Ebola is spread by close personal contact and does not travel through the air. She avoids public transportation to lessen contact with other people.And under no circumstances does she eat bush meat — food made from the remains of monkeys, bats, and rats that is popular in parts of the region and possibly responsible for transmitting Ebola from animals to humans.“My parents said, ‘As long as you don’t eat this meat, you should be fine,’ ” Coffee said.Though no Ebola cases have been reported in Ghana, tucked in the middle of coastal West Africa, the nation is only hours away from countries hit by the virulent disease. Ghanaian authorities have recently blocked flights and restricted immigration in an effort to prevent the  arrival of the disease in the country of 25 million people.Donna A. Patterson, a professor of African studies at Wellesley University specializing in health issues and Coffee’s adviser, said people were right to have concerns about Ebola spreading to Ghana.“They’re legitimate because the borders are so porous, and people can continue to move.” she said.To the west, Ivory Coast (Côte d’Ivoire) buffers Ghana from Ebola-stricken Guinea and Liberia, two countries where more than 1,000 people have been infected, more than 600 fatally, according to the World Health Organization.To the east, Nigeria is two countries over from Ghana, but its biggest city is only a six-hour car trip away. A small cluster of cases has been reported in Lagos.The outbreaks began in March but spread rapidly last month. Underscoring the danger of the disease and the urgency of global efforts to stop its spread, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention raised its alert for Ebola to the highest level Thursday.\nCoffee’s work may involve coming into proximity with human waste that contains bodily fluids, through which Ebola is spread.The researcher says she will be on guard, even as she continues to help the region in her own way.""",

2529,John M. Edgerton,"""WASHINGTON (AP) — Calling for a sharp separation between the nation’s armed forces and local police, President Barack Obama on Monday urged a re-examination of programs that have equipped civilian law enforcement departments with military gear from the Pentagon.The transfers have come under public scrutiny after the forceful police response to racially charged unrest in Ferguson, Missouri.\n\t\nAmid video images of well-armed police confronting protesters with combat weapons and other surplus military equipment, Obama said it would be useful to review how local law enforcement agencies have used federal grants that permit them to obtain heavier armaments.‘‘There is a big difference between our military and our local law enforcement, and we don’t want those lines blurred,’’ Obama told reporters at the White House. ‘‘That would be contrary to our traditions.’’Obama’s remarks came as he called for understanding in the face of anger in Ferguson in the wake of a police shooting of an unarmed 18-year-old black man. Obama said the vast majority of protesters in the St. Louis suburb were peaceful, but said that a small minority was undermining justice for the shooting victim, Michael Brown.The initial police reaction to the protests drew attention to the militarization of local police departments, with critics arguing that the heavily-armed police presence only fueled the tensions. Attorney General Eric Holder and several lawmakers have suggested that the practice of supplying police with such military surplus be reconsidered. A report by the American Civil Liberties Union in June said police agencies had become ‘‘excessively militarized,’’ with officers using training and equipment designed for the battlefield on city streets.Obama said he also spoke to Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon about Nixon’s deployment of National Guard units to help secure Ferguson, urging the governor to ensure that the guard be used in a ‘‘limited and appropriate way.’’‘‘Ill be watching over the next several days, to assess whether, in fact, it’s helping rather than hindering progress in Ferguson,’’ he said.Pausing briefly in the middle of his summer vacation, Obama expressed sympathy for the ‘‘passions and anger’’ sparked by Brown’s death. But he said giving in to that anger through looting and attacks on police only stirs tensions and leads to further chaos. He said overcoming the mistrust endemic between many communities and their local police would require Americans to ‘‘listen and not just shout.’’‘‘That’s how we’re going to move forward together, by trying to unite each other and understand each other and not simply divide ourselves from one another,’’ Obama told reporters at the White House.Obama said Holder would travel to Ferguson this week to meet with FBI and other officials carrying out an independent federal investigation into Brown’s death. Separately, Rep. William Lacy Clay Jr., whose district includes Ferguson, told Democratic lawmakers Monday that he will meet with Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel to push for changes in the program that provides military equipment to local police departments.Appearing in the White House briefing room in a dress shirt but no tie, Obama also spoke for the first time to the racial tensions and grievances perceived by African-Americans in Ferguson. In previous comments about the situation, Obama had avoided talking directly about race, wary of rushing to judgment or further inflaming the situation.Weighing his words carefully, Obama said it was clear that disparities in how blacks and whites are treated and sentenced must be addressed, calling for more safeguards and training to prevent missteps. At the same time, he acknowledged the difficult situation that police officers sometimes face.‘‘There are young black men that commit crime. We can argue about why that happened — because the poverty they were born into or the school systems that failed them or what have you— but if they commit a crime, then they need to be prosecuted,’’ Obama said. ‘‘Because every community has an interest in public safety.’’Brown was unarmed when he was fatally shot by a police officer on Aug. 9 in Ferguson, a predominantly black community that long has been at odds with the mostly white police department. Results of an independent autopsy released Monday by Brown’s family determined that Brown was shot at least six times, including twice in the head.Obama’s remarks on the crisis were the first since the situation in Ferguson escalated over the weekend, with Nixon, the Missouri governor, ordering a midnight curfew for Ferguson and ordering the National Guard to help restore order. Nixon lifted that curfew on Monday, but tensions remained high the morning after police once again deployed tear gas in response to what they said were reports of gunfire, looting and vandalism by protesters.Obama weighed in on the crisis during a brief break in his annual summer vacation at Martha’s Vineyard, where the president was spending two weeks with his family while juggling multiple crises in the U.S. and overseas. Obama returned to the White House late Monday and planned to return to the Massachusetts island on Tuesday. His brief return to Washington had been announced by the White House before the standoff in Ferguson began.""",

2720,Meg Campbell,"""Lawyers for accused Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev want a federal judge to dismiss the sweeping indictment against him, citing concerns about the selection of grand juries in federal court in Boston, where their client faces a possible death sentence, if convicted.In a motion filed Friday, defense attorneys identified several concerns about the manner in which grand juries were selected between 2011 and 2013, including in his case. Among the issues was the fact that qualified jurors over 70 years old were automatically excused upon request.\n\t\nMore than 96 percent of prospective jurors older than  70 chose not to serve in the three-year period, and a nearly identical percentage opted out when Tsarnaev’s grand jury was selected, said the defense motion.“Being over age 70 — like race, sex, and national origin — is an immutable characteristic — one cannot get younger — and exclusion on the basis of such a characteristic gives rise to the appearance of unfairness,""",
2721,Meredith Clapp,""" Tsarnaev’s attorneys wrote.They also argued that African-Americans have been underrepresented in the selection process.“This underrepresentation, Tsarnaev submits, is constitutionally significant,” the lawyers wrote, adding that “underrepresentation in municipal resident lists is attributable to some form of official action or inaction in the jury selection process and is, therefore systemic exclusion.”In addition, about 5 percent of the 400 summonses used to create the grand jury pool in Tsarnaev’s case were returned as undeliverable by the US Postal Service, and there were no draws from a supplemental group to fill the gap, defense attorneys say.They are asking US District Court Judge George A. O’Toole Jr. to “dismiss the indictment returned in this case and stay further proceedings” pending changes to the selection process, according to the filing.Prosecutors did not immediately file a response Friday, and a spokeswoman for US Attorney Carmen M. Ortiz declined to comment.O’Toole has yet to rule on , on the grounds that there is an “overwhelming presumption” of guilt in Massachusetts, among other factors.Tsarnaev, 21, faces charges that could bring the death penalty for his alleged role in the April 15, 2013, bombings, which killed three people, including an 8-year-old boy, and wounded more than 260. He has pleaded not guilty.Tsarnaev and his older brother and alleged accomplice, Tamerlan, are also accused of fatally shooting an MIT police officer. Tamerlan Tsarnaev died in a violent confrontation with police in Watertown days after the blasts.""",

Coaching situation is in flux.\n Grass\n Connors left Amesbury. Another coach had been hired, but wasn\t allowed to assume the position because he wasn\t working at the school. Gearin is the interim coach for the season while the school seeks a solution. Wide receiver Pat Scanlon is the team\s best player. Travis Motsis will help anchor an offensive line that should be strong. Spencer Fournier should be great at running back and linebacker. Who will man the quarterback position is still to be determined.\n\n Division 1 North\n E.J. Perry (5th season)\n 6-5\n Passing game, offensive and defensive lines.\n Adjusting to new up-tempo defense.\n Artificial turf\n With 35 returning letterman, Andover returns one of the deepest rosters in the Merrimack Valley Conference. Quarterback EJ Perry returns under center after a promising freshman campaign where he tallied 700 yards and seven touchdowns through the air. With the departure of running back Jack Sylvester, the plan for coach Perry and Co. is to return the airborne ways of past Golden Warrior teams. Coach Perry anticipates a 50/50 split between the run and pass game, where Perry\s passing game is augmented by running backs Kevin Chen and Brian Duffy. That goal should be made all the easier thanks to the offensive line, which returns four of five starters. Brandon Marty, a 5-foot-8, 185-pound running back who was clocked with a 4.45 40-yard dash this summer, has been impressive early in camp, while slot receiver Zach Walker could be poised for a breakout season. Andover added a new defensive coordinator during the offseason who will employ a more up-tempo style of play, something that could help them climb back towards the top of the MVC.\n\n Division 4 South\n Robert Lomp (14th season)\n 8-3\n Offensive skill positions, particularly at running back.\n Inexperience and depth on the offensive line.\n Grass\n Although junior Chad Gaucher will be taking his first snaps as a starting quarterback Friday against Fairhaven, he will have plenty of experienced help in the backfield. Senior wing-backs Matt Michael and Troy Nanfelt both return, along with 6-6 senior tight end Kevin Falaki who is being heavily recruited throughout the Northeast. Michael, a 2013 South Coast All-Star, heads into the season with 36 career touchdowns, three shy of the school record his brother Nate set back in 2011. The Lakers face a huge test week two at conference rival Dighton-Rehoboth.\n\n Division 5 South\n Bill Kinsherf (19th season)\n 4-7\n Linebacker position.\n Overall depth.\n Artificial turf\n The Bishops will have a difficult time replacing leading rusher and defensive star Kylan Philbert-Richardson, who was a Catholic Central All-Star in 2013.

AHS went 3-8 in each of Dubzinski\s first two seasons, but flipped the script decisively in 2013. \We took our lumps the first two years,\ Dubzinski said, \but last year was a great turning point and we want to keep going in that direction.\ Arlington will rely heavily on All-Scholastic Frank Roche, who has spent time at quarterback, tailback, slot receiver, kick returner, and safety. Roche, a 6-foot-2, 185-pound senior captain, will benefit from what should be a dependable offensive line. Nick Rose, Chris Girouard and Chris Rikeman are all three-year starters and should be able to buy Roche time to make a play. Dubzinski is encouraging his players to put the 9-2 season behind them. Just like they did after going 3-8, the key is to move forward. \When we met with the team for our preseason meeting we put last year in the rearview mirror,\ he said. \It\s ancient history.\\n\n Division 4 North\n Serge Clivio (24th season)\n 2-9\n Quarterback and wide receiver.\n Tackling and overall defense.\n Artificial turf\n After a tough 2013 campaign, Clivio expects a much better outcome this season.

But MacKay is excited for the opportunity his younger players have to further the program. \We have a coachable group of young men, and if they continue to develop we are excited about the possibilities,\ said MacKay. With that, MacKay will rely on his group of 15 seniors to lead the way both on the field and off. \The seniors are a strong group that have helped develop our program,\ said MacKay. Captain Brian Mahan (WR/DB) will set the tone, along with running backs Derek Nash and Jake Keating. Junior captain Joe Kerkash anchors the offensive line, which also features junior Spencer Rabidou and senior James Hatch. Junior Filip Cooper and sophomore Colin Hanrahan will also contribute to a strong running game.\n\n Division 1 South\n Michael Strachan (2d season)\n 9-2\n Offensive and defensive line.\n Replacing graduated quarterback.\n Artificial turf\n Tim Walsh was the best quarterback in Division 1 football last year with 29 touchdown passes, giving Strachan good reason to be concerned about who will be his replacement. In training camp he said two players were battling it out for the job: 6-foot-4, 175-pound sophomore Tyler McGovern and 6-2, 190-pound senior Ross Killion. Attleboro scored 34.3 ppg last fall, a total that will be hard to equal this season.\n\n Division 5 North\n Bill Maradei (36th season)\n 8-3\n Secondary.\n Inexperience and depth.\n Grass\n The Cougars return three starters in the secondary, which according to Maradei is the team\s strength. Senior Connor Duffy and junior Dan Monagle will start in the defensive backfield, while also battling for the starting quarterback position. They are joined by senior captains Kyle Havey (DB/TE), Andrew Lucy (OL/DL), and Bobby Murphy (RB/LB), who will all play key roles on both sides of the ball. """,

The biggest departure may be that of Globe All-Scholastic Hayden Murphy (Princeton), who accounted for 1,400 yards of offense as a running back and tacked on 58 tackles at middle linebacker. Senior Demichael Johnson and junior Jack Pipatti will be the first to get chances out of the backfield as Murphy\s replacement. Junior Griffin Burke makes the jump to the varsity squad and will take the snaps under center. Co-captains Colton Bergal (6-foot-1, 200 pounds) and Owen Murray (6-foot-3, 250) will be looked to as leaders of a young but talented group of Raiders. """,

The positive vibes coming out of camp start with the Eagles\ quintet of senior captains: Sean Holleran (QB), Christian Dallas (TE/DE), Shane Libby (TE/LB), Nick Locken (G/LB), and Scott Gosnell (WR/LB). \We have a great group,\ said Bartlett. \Good senior leaders. I like their approach and attitude. We expect to compete every year and our guys worked hard this past offseason to get ready.\ Junior brothers Will and Matt Johnson are also expected to be major contributors. Will is a wide receiver and cornerback and Matt is a defensive lineman. Junior wide receiver Nick Gill will be another option for Holleran. One concern for Bartlett is on defense, where he must replace a number of starters, including former All-Scholastic linebacker Connor Walsh (Maine).\n\n Division 4 North\n Jack Belcher (11th season)\n 8-3\n Winning tradition and work ethic.\n Inexperience at varsity level.\n Artificial turf\n Bedford won the Division 4 North championship last season and for the first time in school history, has had six consecutive seasons above .500.

The Blackhawks went winless in the Tri-Valley (Small) and averaged just 15.7 points per game, while allowing 34.7. After graduating 12 seniors, including middle linebacker/defensive end Jake Marino and wide receiver/cornerback Wes Kudirka, both Tri-Valley All-Stars last season, the Blackhawks have some holes to fill.\n\n Division 3NW North\n Yann Kumin (1st season)\n 0-11\n Skill positions.\n Offensive line depth and experience.\n Artificial turf\n First-year head coach Kumin knows what it takes to turn a program around. When he was defensive coordinator at Stoneham, he helped a team that won a total of two games in 2010 and 2011 finish 7-4 in 2012. When the opportunity arose to take a head coaching job at Belmont, he knew he couldn\t say no. \Like most guys who have paid their dues and put their time in, you start looking,\ Kumin said. \This job was very appealing to me because there\s a great student body. It seemed to be a very similar situation to the one I encountered at Stoneham, so I was really excited.\ Kumin inherits a Marauder team that finished 0-11 in the Middlesex Liberty in 2013. He\ll try to improve a defense that surrendered 37.5 points per game a year ago. He also has the task of molding an offense that showed signs of dominance in spurts last season but struggled mightily at times. Kumin says Belmont has \skill for days.\ The key is attention to detail and focusing on mastering the nuances of the game. One main contributor for the Marauders will be speedy senior running back Max Jones, who Kumin calls a \good, hard-nosed runner.\ Jones will anchor a Belmont team that is trying to put last season\s woes behind it.\n\n Division 3NE North\n Dan Bauer (12th season)\n 7-4\n Returning skill players.\n Depth on offensive and defensive line.\n Grass\n With their first five games against playoff teams, Bauer and his team are looking to take their game to the next level and make an early statement. Although the team lost 13 starters from last year and Beverly\s all-time leading rusher Isiah White, they bring back a strong set of skill position players including senior wide receiver Mike McKenna and junior running back Jordan Rawding. With senior quarterback Bryan Flaherty back under center, Beverly should be able to light up the scoreboard this season. If they can make it through their first five games, Beverly could be a tough team to handle late in the season.\n\n Division 2 North\n Rich McKenna (2d season)\n 2-9\n Work ethic.\n Offensive and defensive lines.\n Grass\n The Indians begin 2014 with their third coach in as many years as former Cathedral coach Duane Sigsbury slides in to replace Rich McKenna, who departed after one season for Merrimack. Justin Beck will take his first starting snaps at quarterback this fall, but Sigsbury believes the junior has the goods to surprise a lot of people. A pair of rising sophomores will be contributing to the Indians on both sides of the ball. Derek Laundry will see time at both linebacker and running back, while fellow sophomore Dean Brooks will line up at both tight end and linebacker. As training camp comes to a close, the biggest concern for Sigsbury is the cohesion on the offensive and defensive lines. However, Sigsbury believes that come season\s end, those two lines could be a strength for his team. \We just want to work hard every day and climb the ladder,\ Sigsbury said. \No looking back, just keep looking forward.\\n\n Division 6 South\n Justin Kogler (3d season)\n 7-4\n Offensive and defensive lines.\n Youth at the skilled positions.\n Grass\n A host of young players will be the leaders of the Bishop Connolly squad this season as they look to make the playoffs. First year starter Kevin Sullivan will quarterback the squad, which will also seek help in the skill positions from fellow first-year starters Jay McClure at running back and Chaten Nehra at wide receiver. For veteran leadership, Kogler will turn to senior captain Drew Keyes. Kogler expects the 6-foot 1-inch 295-pound lineman to be one of the best players on the field.\n\n Division 3SW South\n Curt Smith (5th season)\n 5-5\n Enthusiasm, camaraderie.\n Inexperience.\n Artificial turf\n With only ten seniors on Bishop Feehan\s roster and just three with significant varsity experience, Smith focused on developing his underclassmen during the preseason. Smith does expect seniors CJ Panciocco and Jacob Dextradeur and junior Dante Volpe to be serious contributors this year. The Shamrocks will take on Canton in week 1, and Smith said despite a lack of experience, the outlook is the same as any other year. \The goal never changes,\ he said. \Win every play and give yourself a chance in the fourth quarter of every football game.\\n\n Division 5 North\n Dave Woods (17th season)\n 13-0\n Rufus Rushins and the running game.\n Replacing Division 5 Player of the Year, Nick Bona.\n Artificial turf\n Woods has the dreadful task of replacing quarterback Nick Bona, who led the Crusaders to a Division 5 Super Bowl win in 2013. Although replacing Bona may be impossible, whoever gets the job can take some relief in knowing senior Rufus Rushins will be behind him. Rushins has run for 3,888 yards over his three seasons at Fenwick and is on pace to finish with over 5,000 career yards. Senior captains Matt Renzulli, David Hurley, Aidan Moulton, and Rob Carrillo will all play crucial roles on a defense that held opponents to 13.6 points per game in 2013. Woods has yet to choose a starting quarterback, but insists the job will go to Renzulli, senior Mike Campagelli, or sophomore Dan Mastromatteo.\n\n Division 4 South\n Ryan Sylvia (3d season)\n 4-7\n Veteran linemen on both sides of the ball.\n Finding replacements for graduated linebackers.\n Grass\n A crushing Week 8 loss to Somerset Berkley cost Bishop Stang the 2013 EAC crown, but Sylvia expects his squad to vie for the championship once again. Junior quarterback Matt Golden returns and captains Nick Caswell and Jeff Carvalho will anchor the senior-laden offensive and defensive lines. Sylvia also has high expectations for sophomore running back Nick Landry and senior captains Mike Mello, a defensive back and quarterback, and Mike Chicca, a wide receiver and cornerback.\n\n Division 6 South\n Ed Catabia (7th season)\n 8-3\n Good team speed and work ethic.\n Young on defense.\n Grass\n Blue Hills is in the process of installing a turf field, which should be ready to play on in mid-October. Catabia said the transition shouldn\t be too difficult for his team, as they play a handful of games on turf fields each season. Catabia is pleased with his young team\s work ethic during preseason and hopes his team puts itself in the best possible position to be competitive come tournament time.\n\n Division 6 North\n Brian Vaughan (2d season)\n 7-4\n Offensive line, skill positions, returning defensive players and quarterback.\n Youthful secondary, team depth.\n Artificial turf\n Vaughan came over from Pope John of Everett last season to boost his alma mater, and it turned out to be the best decision for both sides. The team\s offense went from almost non-existent to one of the best in the City League, posting 20 or more points seven times last season. The transformation from a 3-7 team to 7-4 squad was not solely due to the change in philosophy that the offensive-minded Vaughan brought along, but also because of standout players that had breakthrough seasons, including star quarterback Emmanuel Almonte. The senior finished sixth in scoring in division 6 with 17 touchdowns and 122 points. He also rushed for over 1,600 yards (3 games of 200+ rushing yards), a team and career high. According to coach Vaughan, Almonte has improved even further and has """,

McIntyre will spread the carries between senior Luke Zanoli, senior Elijah Dias, junior Nick Pavalonis and sophomore Dylan Kehoe. After having a \great offseason\ according to McIntyre, he hopes Dias and Pavalonis\ offseason success will carry over to the regular season as he expects them to play a more critical role in the offense.\n\n Division 2 South\n Brian Chamberlain (4th season)\n 4-7\n Experience and team speed.\n Depth at linebacker.\n Artificial turf\n Expect to see a lot of underclassmen get playing time for Chamberlain. Coming off a season in which team speed was Braintree\s most glaring weakness, Chamberlain said his sophomore class has brought a speed element that should help the Wamps compete in the league.\n\n Division 1 South\n Dan Buron (22d season)\n 7-3\n Skill positions.\n Getting offensive and defensive lines experience.\n Artificial turf\n For three straight seasons, Bridgewater-Raynham has played second fiddle to Barnstable in the Old Colony League, but a slew of experience at the skill position has the Trojans poised to break through this fall. The Trojans have the luxury of carrying two quarterbacks with proven experience under center. Matt Clement began 2013 as the starter, but when sidelined by illness midway through the season, Steve D\Emilia came in and guided the offense through the playoffs. Running back/linebacker Brandon Gallagher returns for his senior season and should prove to be a menace on both sides of the ball. Connor Reagan will also be instrumental for the Trojans this fall, lining up as a tight end on offense and setting the edge as a defensive end on defense. B-R has some holes to fill on the offensive line, but Buron believes his guys are coming along strong as they work to erase the memory of a gut-wrenching, 40-14 loss to Attleboro in the Division 1 South semifinals. \We got embarrassed in the semis last year,\ Buron said. \I think the kids haven\t forgotten that, but first things first, and that\s taking care of the league.\\n\n Division 5 North\n Randolph Abraham (3d season)\n 8-3-0\n Seasoned and experienced core; young, talented receivers; strong running game.\n Inexperience at skill positions, resiliency.\n Grass\n The Bengals are coming off an extremely productive year, as they finished 8-3 and claimed the Boston City title in 2013.

That is the goal Parris has set for his squad this season. Parris has yet to name his starting quarterback and is concerned about inexperience on the offensive and defensive lines, but noted he has a great core of young, physical players. Bristol-Plymouth also has an upgraded receiving core led by senior captain Cam Dennis.\n\n Division 1 South\n Peter Colombo (12th season)\n 5-6\n Veteran playmakers.\n Production from less experienced players.\n Artificial turf\n The Boxers will be looking to bounce back from a 5-6 season. \We hope to rebound. Last year was not what we expected,\ said Colombo. \Hopefully some players gained experience.\ Colombo said his team has some \good pillars\ to lean on, including 6-foot-6, 300-pound offensive lineman Aaron Monteiro. \It\s one thing to be big, but he brings athleticism,\ said Colombo of Monteiro, who is headed to Boston College. \You\d like to run behind him.\ Junior running back Kerry Raymond will have that opportunity and also star on defense. Senior Aaron Williams will be a dual-threat at quarterback and will throw to junior captain and tight end Marcus Bullard and wide receiver John Derolus.

Two-year starting quarterback, Ryan Feely will make the move to wide receiver, and junior Pat Bent will take over at QB. At 6-4, Feely not only makes for a big target, but has serious running ability. A 400-yard rushing season can attest to that. Bent can run and pass, which makes their flex offense that much more deadly. The offense is deepest on the line, with four returning three-year starters. Fraccalossi had a chance to preview the offense in scrimmage against Bourne. \It was very surprising,\ he said. \It was the best scrimmage we\ve had. We moved the ball well on offense.\ On the other side of the ball, junior Zach Burt will be a player to watch.

Two years removed from a Super Bowl victory, the team will bring back their entire backfield from that winning season, all of whom were instrumental in winning the championship as sophomores. That bunch includes the speedy Bryan Cedeno (15 TDs last season), the powerful Jermal Brevard-Jackson, and Super Bowl hero, quarterback Kejonte Hickman. """,

After being dispatched in the playoffs last season, these seniors have something to prove.\n\n Division 1 South\n Alex Campea (11th season)\n 5-6\n Athleticism.\n Depth.\n Artificial turf\n The Knights play one of the toughest schedules in one of the best conferences in the state. But winning a Catholic Conference title remains the goal. \We look forward to competing for a conference championship,\ said Campea, whose team returns five starters on each side of the ball. \That\s always the goal. We have some spots to fill, but we\re optimistic.\ Safety Kevin Bletzer (Boston College) and offensive lineman Connor Peck (Bentley) are among the Knights who were lost to graduation. But Campea is confident he has a good core of players to help fill the void. Senior captains Aaron Clancy (WR/DE), Trevor Cooley (TE/LB), Kam Gingrass (RB/CB), and Brian Coppinger (OL/DL) will provide good leadership. Juniors Curt Bletzer (WR) and Darren Wagner (RB) are also poised to be impact players.\n\n Division 1 North\n Chuck Adamopoulos (18th season)\n 11-1\n Quarterback and running back.\n Lack of depth, inexperience at wide receiver and secondary.\n Artificial turf\n As is the case with many championship teams, the Raiders graduated some serious pop on both sides of the ball after capturing the Division 1 title in December. Globe Division 1 Player of the Year and reigning Merrimack Offensive Player of the Year Cody Demers has graduated, taking with him 788 receiving yards and nine touchdowns. The Raiders also said goodbye to the explosive play-making ability of running back/defensive back D\Andre Drummond-Mayrie, who trampled Xaverian to the tune of 119 yards and three touchdowns in the Division 1 title game. While absent some high-profile names, the Raiders do retain a plethora of talent on both sides of the ball. Senior running backs Michael Balsamo (6-foot-1, 202 lbs) and Markus Edmunds (5-foot-11, 210 lbs), who have been producing since they were freshmen, will anchor the backfield while juniors Steve Jackson and Greg Marggraf become the new targets at wide receiver. But maybe no returning player is more important for the Raiders\ title defense than quarterback Mike Milano. As a junior last fall, the Globe All-Scholastic completed 57 percent of his passes for 1,810 yards and 15 touchdowns while adding another 710 yards of offense and 14 touchdowns on the ground. \He\s out leader on offense,\ said Adamopoulos. \We\re going to go as he goes.\\n\n Division 6 North\n David Cahill (1st season)\n 3-8-0\n Solid running game, high number of home games.\n Depth, lack of experience.\n Artificial turf\n Cahill takes over after spending eight seasons as an assistant. The Townies lost some big-name players, including star lineman Brandon Scott who transferred to Deerfield Academy for his senior year. Consequently, the Townies will be featuring a number of first-year players they must rely on. It should be noted that Cahill\s squad will play seven of their games at home this season, including four of their first five contests. """,

Quarterback Jack Campsmith returns for his third and final season under center, experience that should serve as an asset while Chelmsford finds the heir apparent to graduated running back Jack D\Auria (Stonehill). Junior Tyrone Phet is one of several players who could emerge in the backfield. According to Rich, junior wideout Matt Courtemanche could prove to be a dangerous player outside the numbers, as the Lions try to work magic through the air this fall. """,

Chelsea and Essex Tech, formerly North Shore, are usually atop the league at season\s end and don\t expect this year to be any different. Key acquisitions from the Chelsea-Pope John (Everett) merger, including standout senior receiver Moises Casado, should help bolster the offense and help the Devils get rolling. Look for senior rusher Sammy Rivera to lead the team.\n\n Division 6 South\n Peter Afanasiw (9th season)\n 11-2\n Athleticism.\n Overall depth.\n Artificial turf\n After making it to the Division 6 Super Bowl last year, the Skippers will look to build off the momentum gained from the deep playoff run. \They learned to play in big game situations,\ said Afanasiw. \They know how to compete in space. They\re really well-rounded athletes.\ Senior running back Cole Kissick will look to be a prominent force in the backfield, after a 19 TD regular season. Despite the loss of Chris Haggerty at quarterback, Afanasiw feels optimistic. He said that Haggerty set an example for his players to follow, that they should try to live up to what he\s done. On defense, Cohasset will be led by senior captain and all-state wrestler, Matt Froio. \We\d like to try and repeat last year - if not, we\d like to improve on it,\ Afanasiw said.\n\n Division 3NW North\n Mike Robichaud (6th season)\n 8-3\n Skill positions and a strong backfield.\n Depth.\n Grass\n Coach Mike Robichaud said his team came ready to play in the preseason.

3478,Erica Pereira,"""We are moving at a pace a little slower than usual, but the kids have improved.""",
3479,Erica Pereira,""" One area Robichaud is particularly optimistic about is the linebacker position. Junior Patrick Crowley was the team\s defensive MVP last year as a sophomore. Seniors Robert Walton and Jack Barrett are also returning starters at linebacker. Junior Austin Hoey will return at quarterback after starting every game for the Patriots last season. Hoey was an All-Star in football, basketball, and lacrosse last year. Senior Andrew Kielar and junior Kejuan Farquharson are other players to watch on offense.\n\n Division 4 South\n Thomas Pileski (9th season)\n 1-10\n Experienced offensive and defensive linemen.\n Lack of depth.\n Grass\n After a subpar season, Pileski is confident of his team\s chances in the EAC. The Warriors \ just 23 varsity players \ need to stay healthy. \Hopefully we have quality, because we definitely don\t have quantity,\ Pileski said. Leading the offense will be junior quarterback Tristan Blaisdell, who won the position last season. Pileski expects Blaisdell to bring balance to an offense that was one-dimensional (run oriented) last season, giving Coyle and Cassidy the ability to move the ball through the air and on the ground. The Warriors also benefit from veteran linemen on both sides of the ball.\n\n Division 3NE North\n Shawn Theriault (1st season)\n 7-4\n Depth at all positions.\n Inexperienced offensive line.\n Grass\n With several key players returning from last year\s NEC North Championship, the Falcons look to continue their winning ways under Theriault, a former Wakefield High player. QB Nick Andreas has had a great summer throwing to some electric athletes such as fellow senior captain Cris Valles, senior James English, junior Mike Nestor, and sophomore Matt Andreas. With only a few returning offensive linemen, star running back and captain Chris Behen looks to solidify a ground game. Danvers will be stout on defense with eight returning starters led by senior captain Richie Martino, senior corner John Thomas, tackle Drew Salvo, and defensive end Skylar Falite.\n\n Division 3SE South\n Richard White (11th season)\n 6-5\n Running backs.\n Offensive and defensive line.\n Grass\n With league contests against top-tier programs in Bridgewater-Raynham (Div. 1) and Barnstable (Div. 2), the league grind should award the Indians a wealth of experience when the Division 3 playoffs roll around. The stable is packed at running back as the Indians return a wealth of experience in the backfield. Senior Jack McCabe and juniors Chris Martin and Alex Tisdelle reunite after combining for 12 touchdowns in 2013. Exactly who will be dishing the ball to the backs is still up for debate, however. Senior quarterbacks Matt Beauparland and Blaine Almeida are both in contention for the starting job with both athletes offering a different element under center \ Almeida a more traditional pocket-passer while Beauparland is a more mobile quarterback. The talent at the skill positions is a welcome commodity to the Indians as inexperienced offensive and defensive lines must work to define their identities over the course of the season.\n\n Division 4 South\n David Flynn (4th season)\n 4-7\n Senior leadership, returning defensive players.\n Graduation of key players.\n Artificial turf\n A sizable group of veteran starters return for the Marauders, led by senior quarterback and captain Mike Kadlick. Dedham\s defense will be lead by senior captain Ron Pucci, a three-year starter at cornerback. The offensive and defensive lines will be anchored by senior captains Fred Melly and Jim Coughlin. Flynn also expects significant contributions from senior running back Raheem Powell, a 2013 league all star. Dedham\s kicking duties will be handled by returning starter Liam Madden.\n\n Division 4 South\n Paul Funk (13th season)\n 10-3\n Team speed.\n Depth.\n Grass\n Michael Dunn is a versatile weapon for the Dolphins. Funk said Dunn is capable of playing safety, corner, quarterback, and slot receiver. \He\s someone that can just do a lot of things,\ Funk said. Dunn has helped Dennis-Yarmouth turn into a consistent contender. The Dolphins finished 10-3 last season, scoring 40 or more points four weeks in a row in the middle of the season. \What we\ve cultivated over the past few years is execute, work hard, and worry about ourselves,\ Funk said. \The rest will take care of itself on the field.\ Funk will also rely on Andrew Jamiel, Nick Coelho, Zack Mancini, Chip Evangelista, L.K. Metz, and Dan Robles.\n\n Division 3SE South\n Dave Driscoll (34th season)\n 7-4\n All four senior captains started as sophomores and three of them play both ways.\n Inexperience on the offensive line.\n Grass\n The only Division 3 team in the SCC Large, the Falcons will be eyeing the conference crown in 2014.

Diman, which had the best Mayflower home record last fall at 4-1, returns seven starters to the squad and looks to those seven to lead a young squad. Vickney notes the team\s work ethic will be its identity throughout the season and will hopefully lead to a strong performance and eventual playoff push.\n\n Division 6 North\n Richard Moran (9th season)\n 6-4\n Leadership, positive team attitude.\n Only four returning starters, depth.\n Artificial turf\n With only four returning starters, the Bears will be hard pressed to make a real run for the playoffs.

Rivers, who was Dracut\s offensive line coach last year, is the new man in charge. His main goal is to build off the momentum the Middies generated last season when they won three of their final four games. After starting the season 0-7, Dracut beat Belmont 36-20, shut out Revere, 14-0, and outlasted Salem, 34-27, before losing to Methuen on Thanksgiving. Rivers said Ty Bassett is a dual threat at quarterback as well as a defensive leader at safety. He also expects production from wide receiver Jack McKenna, who didn\t play last season but has impressed early this year. Rivers said linebacker Steve Valente has emerged as one of the defense\s leaders. As a former offensive line coach, Rivers is naturally worried about Dracut\s line, which features four newcomers and only one returning starter.\n\n Division 2 South\n Taylor Brown (1st season)\n 0-11\n Varsity experience; skill positions.\n Offensive line; depth.\n Artificial turf\n The Hilltoppers are looking for a culture change.

Junior tailback Elijah Brooks is a strong runner and junior quarterback Jaren Viera will be one of the team\s leaders.

Brown\s concern is on the offensive line, which is on the smaller side.\n\n Division 2 South\n Dave Maimaron (10th season)\n 5-5\n Depth at skill positions. Pass Defense.\n Inexperience on offensive line.\n Artificial turf\n Duxbury finished last year with four straight losses to close out a 5-5 season. The five losses were more than the team has suffered over the previous five years combined. Despite the late season struggles, the Dragons went 4-0 in league play, topping the division. Still, Maimaron\s squad is looking to bounce back from what they considered a down year. The team returns seven starters on offense including senior wide receiver Cam Walsh, sophomore running back Devin DeMeritt, and sophomore QB Bobby Maimaron.

The North Shore Bulldogs football program swapped it\s signature white and blue colors for Blue, green and white and traded their Bulldog for a Hawk. But that wasn\t the only change. With a new program comes a new coach, Greg Haberland, longtime assistant of former North Shore coach, Paul Worth. Worth led North Shore for 18 seasons before handing the duties over to his assistant of 20 years. The familiarity between Haberland and the returning players should help the transition for last season\s Commonwealth Small champs, but the loss of starting running back Ross Murphy (15 touchdowns, 111 points last season) is a big blow to their offense. The team will lean heavily on key returning starters from a season ago. Senior Yordany Sanchez, who played WR but will make the switch to QB this year, and senior running back Daniel Bailey will lead the offense. If these seniors can help lead the team amid the shake up, look for the Hawks compete for a playoff spot again.\n\n Division 1 North\n John DiBiaso (33d season)\n 8-2\n Offensive and defensive lines.\n Tackling; lack of experience at some positions.\n Artificial turf\n The Tide\s quest for a fourth straight Super Bowl title ended in the D1 North final last season, but they should be right back in contention this fall. The road back to the promised land could be bumpy early, though. Everett opens with Springfield Central, Xaverian, Tewksbury, and St. John\s Prep. \We\ve got a real tough start to the season. The first four games are like murderer\s row,\ said DiBiaso. But the Tide\s stout offensive line, led by senior center Eric Trickett, should provide plenty of running room for a bevy of running backs. Senior Nick Orekoya (a Billerica transfer) and juniors Jackinson Joacine and Luis Cardona give Everett plenty of options out of the backfield. Sophomore Jordan MacAfee will debut at quarterback and is \the real deal,\ according to members of the Everett coaching staff. Defensively, the Tide is also strong on the line, which is led by junior end J.J. Colimon. Boston College-bound cornerback Lukas Denis (also a threat at wide receiver) will head the secondary, along with Orekoya and senior Ralph Dupervil. \It might be the fastest defense we\ve ever had,\ said DiBiaso. One weak spot on defense could be at linebacker where the Tide graduated C.J. Parvelus and former All-Scholastic Angel Duarte, though senior Mark Cardwell should be a solid replacement.\n\n Division 5 South\n Rudy Bulgar (5th season)\n 3-8\n Experience on offense and defense.\n Third-down defense.\n Grass\n After missing the playoffs by just one game last season, Fairhaven\s main goal this season is to qualify for the tournament. \Our team expectations are to qualify for playoffs, anything less would be a disappointing season,\ said the fifth-year coach. Quarterback Cam Charette and receivers Noah Furtado and Kross Negalha, will look to lead Fairhaven\s explosive offense as the Blue Devils look to make a push toward the post season.\n\n Division 3SE South\n Derek Almeida (1st season)\n 1-9-1.\n Physicality.\n Inexperience; new offense and defense to learn.\n Grass\n Almeida accepted the Clippers\ coaching job the second week of July, which means he\s still figuring out who are his best players. Almeida is also working to make sure his team understands the new schemes he is trying to implement. He plans to run the option frequently and mix in play action on offense. On defense, he\s replacing the 4-3 Falmouth ran last year with a 4-2-5 concept. \It\s still football,\ Almeida said, \but it\s a little foreign to these kids what we\re doing.\ Fortunately for Almeida, Falmouth\s first game isn\t until Sept. 13 at Sharon, so the team has time to adapt. Despite the challenge ahead, Almeida loves the physicality of his squad. He has a bunch of tough players who can contribute; it\s just a matter of figuring out whom to put where. Juniors Hunter Scribner and Tyler Brown and sophomore Nick Couhig are competing for the starting quarterback job. Almeida\s goal is to narrow it down to two quarterbacks by Week 1. Splitting time isn\t out of the question by any means, and Almeida\s sure the two quarterbacks who don\t start will be on the field in some other capacity.\n\n Division 4 South\n Jack Martinelli (33d season)\n 6-5\n Experience on both sides.\n Replacing linebackers.\n Grass\n After finishing 6-5, and third in the Hockomock (Davenport), Foxboro should be much improved in 2014. Backed by a strong returning group on both sides of the ball, Martinelli likes what he sees. \Our skilled kids are really pretty good,\ he said of his returners, which include the entire backfield and Hockomock All-Star quarterback Nolan Rogers. \I think we\re ready to put forth a pretty balanced attack.\ On the downside, replacing the linebacker duo of Salman Alam and Hockomock All-Star Luc Valenza might be a little tough.\n\n Division 1 South\n Gary Doherty (17th season)\n 2-9\n Depth in the secondary.\n Competitive level of the league.\n Grass\n Senior captain and quarterback Chris Stouranas will lead the Flyers spread offense this year. The Flyers struggled last season as a result of many first-year varsity players getting playing time. Coming into this season with more experience on both sides of the ball, there should be improvement. However, nothing comes easy in the Bay State Carey.\n\n Division 1 South\n Brad Sidwell (18th season)\n 5-6\n Improved size.\n Overall experience.\n Artificial turf\n Senior 6-foot-3, 185-pound Kyle Skidmore will lead Franklin\s spread offense this year after ending last season as the starter.

Cooper Martens, the team\s leading rusher last season, returns to anchor the offense.\n\n Division 3NE North\n Tony Zerilli (4th season)\n 7-4\n Quick, athletic, and aggressive.\n Undersized.\n Artificial turf\n Zerilli\s squad is looking to improve from last season\s team that made it to the second round of the playoffs. Gloucester returns nine starters including junior three-year starting cornerback Alex Enes and senior linebacker and fullback John Salvi-Souza. With the loss of their entire offensive line, junior quarterback Mike Cody will be depended upon to lead a young athletic team through the Northeastern conference this season. Zerilli said his quarterback has worked hard to improve as a leader and expects him to lead the offensive attack this year.\n\n Division 5 North\n Tony Sarkis (9th season)\n 6-5\n Potent and experienced offense, depth of talent.\n Young defense.\n Grass\n A young defensive core is a bit of a concern for the Reggies, but an experienced offense should lead them to a successful season underSarkis.

Alongside Richards, fullback and defensive lineman Jacob Tavares will also be a senior expected to make an impact. Though the Bears have just eight returning starters and lack depth, Allaire believes Greater New Bedford can contend in the SCC Small. \We are not a deep team, but if we stay healthy, we will compete.\\n\n Division 4 North\n Andrew Morency (9th season)\n 5-6\n Offensive line, Linebackers.\n Inexperience at running back and quarterback.\n Grass\n With strong numbers, and some outstanding seniors, the Generals have the potential for a strong year. If they can stay healthy, they could be in the hunt for their third playoff appearance in four years. Nolan Wilson and Jimmy Campbell are a formidable tandem at the wide receiver position as both stand over 6 feet tall.Jimmy Littlefield covers the entire field from his free safety position, and has looked good running behind full back Kai Khristich. The offensive line has the size and experience. If they stay healthy, the offense could be dangerous.\n\n Division 4 South\n Chris Landolfi (2d season)\n 7-5\n Young talent, leadership.\n Moving to new offense, linemen.\n Artificial turf\n With 30 sophomores and 10 seniors, the Indians will look to blend youth and experience in the coming season. The incoming sophomores will be coming off of a 9-1 season on the freshman team. \Watching them play,\ said Landolfi. \I expect them to be good. They are all well-rounded athletes.\ This season, the Indians will be making the move to a zone offense, which will be more ground and play-action oriented. This move will help fill the void left by graduated all-star quarterback, Dean Prouty. Experienced tailbacks Brad Rogers (5-10, 165 pounds) and Dimitry LaForrest (5-10, 175 pounds), have the speed to make plays. Junior quarterback Joe Byrne has a good arm, making the air attack still a viable option. Seamus Boutin (SS), Stephen Coky (OLB), and Mike McLeod (MLB) will look to lead the team on defense. \Their leadership, the way they hold themselves, they are really intelligent players,\ Landolfi said of the captains. \It\s a good mix with them.\\n\n Division 2 North\n Tim O\Connor (5th season)\n 7-4\n Offensive line and secondary.\n Inexperience and offensive skill.\n Artificial turf\n Haverhill returns five offensive linemen and a strong secondary. O\Connor is confident his team can build off last year\s success and string together another successful season. \Our expectations are to win the MVC and make the playoffs and go as far as possible,\ he said. \We\ve turned it around and now it\s time to keep going forward.\ Haverhill beat Lowell, 28-21, on Thanksgiving, capping its season in style. This year the Hillies will count on sophomore quarterback Broughan McGovern, who O\Connor says has a lot of potential. McGovern and Co. will face two tough tests early in Beverly and Central Catholic.\n\n Division 3SW South\n Paul Killinger (18th season)\n 5-6\n Leadership on offensive and defensive lines.\n Lack of depth and experience at the skill positions.\n Artificial turf\n The Harbormen are looking to bounce back from a 1-3 record in league play last season. The team\s strength lies in the trenches with seniors Liam McCarthy, Jackson Perkins, and Wilson Brown locking down both sides of the ball up front. """,
3522,Erica Pereira,"""We will cause problems for people,""",
3523,Erica Pereira,""" said Killinger. The pre-season, however, was not too kind to Hingham. With season-ending injuries to senior running back/defensive back Stewart Fay and senior wide receiver Joey Reale, the Harbormen are """,
3524,Erica Pereira,"""scrambling at the skill positions,""",
3525,Erica Pereira,""" according to Killinger. Seniors Ryan McGuire and Kevin Hanney are looking to fill the needs.\n\n Division 6 South\n Luke Riso (2d season)\n 1-8\n Full season under the belt of head coach Riso.\n Depth and experience of players.\n Grass\n Coming off a one-win season, Holbrook is looking to improve in any way it can. With a full season under the belt of Riso, the squad can look to capitalize on lessons learned last season. Much of the improvement needed is on the offensive side of the ball, where Holbrook averaged just 10.9 ppg.\n\n Division 4 South\n Todd Kiley (12th season)\n 8-3\n Speed and strength.\n Depth.\n Artificial turf\n The Panthers were a relatively young group last season when they lost in the Division 4 South title game. That youth of last season is paying off now. Holliston will have nine returning starters on defense and seven on offense. Four-year starter Joe Bellomo, quarterback Nick Athy, receiver Zach Elkinson and lineman Jonny Docarmo are all returning TVL All-Stars from last year. According to coach Todd Kiley the team had great strength and conditioning sessions this summer and they haven\t forgotten about their playoff exit. """,

3529,Erica Pereira,"""\n\n Division 3SW South\n Jim Girard (5th season)\n 6-5\n Speed at offensive skill positions.\n Inexperience on defense.\n Grass\n The Hopkinton offense should hit the ground running this season with returning starters at quarterback, running back, and wide receiver. Pat Ryan is a duel-threat quarterback who, at 6-feet, 185 pounds, has good size and arm strength. Running back Drew Donohue rushed for more than 1,000 yards last season. Matt Decina and Chase Lampert are returning starters at receiver. One area that may concern Hopkinton is the offensive line. Sean Bennett is the only returning starter on the line. While Conrad Lavoie, Josh Sokol, Sam Lehman and Jack Gulefy are all new to the starting lineup, Girard expects a big year from them. """,

Dubovy had a big year as a sophomore, throwing for 18 touchdowns. Murphy had seven TD receptions, also as a sophomore. McGrath said his team runs a multiple formation offense. They\re able to keep things simple, but dynamic based on the game situation. \I think we\ll be competitive this season,\ said McGrath. \We\ve been working hard. Our goal is to win the South Shore Small League title.\\n\n Division 4 North\n Greg Brotherton (2d season)\n 2-9\n Experience at the skill positions. Experience on defense, especially at linebackers.\n Depth on both sides of the line, youth in the secondary.\n Grass\n The Tigers are young and will rely on sophomores Charlie Gillis and Tyler Starr to play big roles in the secondary as well as on offense. With a decent number of returners, it\s hard to fathom the Tigers only winning two games again. The addition of younger players will help their future plans as well.\n\n Division 2 South\n Brian Lee (10th season)\n 8-3\n Offensive and defensive line.\n Inexperience at linebacker and overall mental toughness.\n Grass\n It will be a challenging season for a King Philip team that will have a lot of first-year varsity players getting major playing time. Lee noted one of his wide receivers and his linebackers may be sophomores. Sophomore John DeLuca will take over the quarterback responsibilities. The competitive Hockomock Kelley-Rex can be a tough place for young players, with two top 10 teams last fall.\n\n Division 6 North\n Rocco Zizza (7th season)\n 9-2\n Experience and offensive line.\n Depth, lack of skill position players.\n Grass\n With 90 percent of last year\s starters gone, including the City\s all-time leading TD passer in Kyle Dance, the Dragon\s will be looking not only for some leadership this season.

They surrendered 34.1 points per game in 2013, which was worst in either division in the Merrimack Valley. This year Yameen believes his team can turn things around and piece together a more consistent season. Nelson Valerio, a 5-foot-11, 170-pound senior, will call the shots at quarterback. Valerio, a mobile quarterback who has improved his accuracy over the years, finished third in Division 1 with 20 touchdown passes a year ago. His main weapon will be Luis Crispin Jr., a big target who has developed chemistry with Valerio. Yameen said the most important factor for how well his team does this year is maturity.\n\n Division 1 North\n George Peterson (4th season)\n 5-6\n Veteran players with two or three seasons of varsity experience.\n Lack of size and depth.\n Grass\n It\s no secret who Lexington\s biggest weapon is on offense. Quarterback Jeff Costello, who accounted for 46 touchdowns last year as a sophomore (30 in the air and 16 on the ground), is back for more. He loses senior wide receiver Rhett Adley, who caught 16 of those 30 passes, but Peterson still expects big things from his No. 1 playmaker. Free safety Alex Huff picked off four passes last year and Peterson believes he\ll bring the same energy and playmaking ability this year. Lexington boasts a strong first unit, but Peterson said his team\s depth isn\t superb. \We usually have one line of depth, really,\ he said. \We don\t have great numbers within our program.\\n\n Division 2 North\n Tom Lopez (37th season)\n 7-4\n Team speed and work ethic.\n Depth and LB and RB, first-year quarterback and the kicking game.\n Artificial turf\n Although Lopez will be relying on many underclassmen, he was impressed by how hard his Warriors worked in the offseason to improve team speed. Expect senior running-back Otto Zacardo to get a majority of the carries.\n\n Division 1 North\n John Florence (4th season)\n 7-4\n Linebacking core.\n Inexperience at skill positions, offensive line.\n Artificial turf\n The Red Raiders begin 2014 with a slew of new faces on offense as they work to replace quarterback Brian Dolan, running back Ngaiiva Mason, and wide receivers Keegan Latta and Jack Galvin. Galvin, a Globe All-Scholastic last fall, wreaked havoc on opposing defenses as Lowell made a charge to the Division 1 North semifinals. What the Red Raiders lack on offense they make up for on defense with arguably the best linebacking duo in the state. Anchored by Syracuse commit Shyheim Cullen (6-foot-1, 210 lbs) and another Division 1 talent in Nicolau Coury (5-foot-11, 205 lbs), the defense will carry a wealth of responsibility as the offense meshes together. Juniors Joshua Villanueva and Malik Settles may be poised for breakouts this season. Villanueva will be the No. 3 linebacker on defense and should split time with Cullen at running back. Settles will help in the trenches on the offensive and defensive line as the Red Raiders compete in one of the tougher leagues in the state. \Our expectations are pretty high,\ said Florence. \We understand it\s a very tough schedule, not only the MVC but other D1 schools that we play. We have to go out be ready to compete every Friday night.\\n\n Division 5 North\n Rick Sampson (4th season)\n 5-6\n Team speed, chemistry.\n Youth, inexperience.\n Artificial turf\n Sampson is aware the CCL small is going to be very competitive this season. With Cathedral and Pope John Paul II to compete with for the league title, Sampson was quick to concede they are the teams to beat. The Crusaders bring back only three returning starters from last year\s campaign, which will make it tough to compete against teams like Cathedral that are top-heavy with senior talent. But if the team can shore up their defense and give up less than the 26.8 points per contest they averaged last season, there is room to get above .500.\n\n Division 2 North\n Tim Phelps (7th season)\n 5-6\n Team speed.\n Experience.\n Artificial turf\n Phelps has the challenge of replacing 23 graduating seniors from last year\s squad. The Rams\ defensive line returns four starters, but he\ll be looking to newcomers to rebuild his offense, including a new quarterback. The Rams have good overall speed, but Phelps says depth and injuries could be major issue. Classical had the best home record of any team in the NEC North (3-1).\n\n Division 2 North\n Peter Holey (7th season)\n 3-7\n Athleticism.\n Offensive and defensive line.\n Artificial turf\n Holey isn\t too worried about his young offensive and defensive line and believes his team has the athletes to make a return trip to the playoffs this season. """,

3539,Erica Pereira,""" Holey said. Lynn English brings back two dynamic playmakers in senior quarterback Lucas Harris and senior running back Steve Collins. If their skill position players can stay healthy this season, Holey\s team could be a tough opponent in the NEC North. They begin their season Sept. 12 against Peabody.\n\n Division 6 North\n James Runner (5th season)\n 4-6\n Familiarity as a team and returning starters.\n Depth.\n Artificial turf\n The Tigers had an average year last season but gave up a boat load of points each game (25 points per game). In order to compete with North Shore, Minuteman, and Chelsea for postseason rights, they must improve defensively first, but they also must improve offensively (17.6 points per game). """,

(Malden lost to GBL rival Everett, 39-6, in the first round of the D1 North playoffs last season.) \We were young as heck last year,\ said Pappagallo. \Our goal was to make the playoffs last year...and our goal this year is to do a little better.\ Senior middle linebacker Anthony Boulay was a GBL All-Star last season and should headline a solid front seven. Senior Josh Bessey, another GBL All-Star, will play guard and defensive end. Senior tight end Isaac Bethea is receiving Division 1 attention, according to Pappagallo. \He\s fast and catches everything,\ said Pappagallo. Sophomore Marvens Fedna steps in at running back for his cousin Raymond Sainristill.\n\n Division 2 North\n Jeff Smith (4th season)\n 0-11\n Senior leadership, experience.\n Depth, youth a key positions.\n Artificial turf\n The Lancers were winless a year ago, but return seven starters on each side of the ball. Smith was also able to get his young players game experience last season, something he hopes translates to more success this year. Smith has been pleased with his team\s leadership, led by senior captains Alex Massa (RB/LB) and Jason Woods (OL). Senior offensive linemen Anthony Gill and Martin Guinee and senior defensive end Walter Macaulay also provide a veteran presence. The Lancers are still young at key positions. But sophomores Colin Sullivan (QB), Kellen Field (RB/DB), and Liam Smith (OLB) have the potential to be impact players.\n\n Division 5 North\n Michael Athanas (11th season)\n 6-5\n Skill players on offense, linebacker depth.\n Overall depth.\n Artificial turf\n The Hornets should be able to put up points with the best of them, and as long as the defense can improve down the stretch and make key stops, Manchester Essex could be a pain in the neck of Division 5 opponents.

Now Silva\s goal is to take another step forward and finish with a winning record. \Our goal is to improve on that 5-6 and get back to normalcy as far as we\re concerned with our yearly record,\ Silva said. Junior dual-threat quarterback Jack Masterson, who has started since his freshman year, will lead the way. \He doesn\t have blazing speed, but he\s got a little shiftiness to him,\ Silva said of Masterson. \Hopefully he\ll find some holes.\ Masterson may need to run the ball a good amount because Silva is still figuring out who his main running backs will be. He\s not concerned about Shane Leonard, though, who he said is \gonna be a beast\ anchoring the offensive line. Silva has many juniors, like Masterson, who have been on the team since their freshman year.

The backfield features three junior running backs in Austin Chandler, Isaac Higgins. and Jacob Cardoza. Senior quarterback Mike missed time last season with an injury, but could be a significant contributor. Herman expects the improvement of his team\s kicking game to be critical, with the duties falling on 6-5 sophomore James Sashin.

A fast and powerful backfield led by Robert Andrade (5-9, 165 pounds), DeShaun Dias (5-9, 190 pounds), and fullback Sam Elithalt (5-10, 175 pounds ), will look to lead the charge on offense. Both Andrade and Dias are described as sprint speed players, with Andrade possessing good vision and hands, along with an exceptional ability to make cuts. Last year, due to seven injuries to two-way players, a younger group of players were forced to take on the role as starters. \It was a trial by fire for those young kids,\ said Triveri. \We had some undersized players who maybe shouldn\t have been out there, but they got that experience. They all came back.\ The return of defensive end Joe Spinola (6-4, 225 pounds) and inside linebacker Ethan West (6-1, 210 pounds) will bolster a hard-hitting defense.\n\n Division 6 North\n Anthony Nalen (2d season)\n 2-9\n Offensive line.\n Depth.\n Artificial turf\n With the loss of running back Akeem Anderson, the Warriors will be in dire need of a dynamic player to help bolster their offense, which only averaged 11.1 points per game last season. Playing against the high-powered offenses found at Cathedral and Pope John Paul II, the Warriors would serve themselves well if they can improve upon their shaky defense that surrendered 29.9 points per game.\n\n Division 3SW South\n Erik Ormberg (4th season)\n 3-8\n Skill positions, senior leadership.\n Depth on offensive and defensive line.\n Artificial turf\n Medfield, looking for its first winning season since 2008, enters the 2014 season optimistic that it can turn things around. Fourth-year coach Ormberg will be going into the season with 24 seniors, his largest senior class. \That experience will pay off for us,\ Ormberg said. \They know the system and they are comfortable with what we are asking them to do.\ The Warriors can count on returning quarterback Stephen Lebogar along with returning receivers Matt Patry and Dean Adams. Ormberg is expecting big years from them and also from Joey Sears and Dan Zlevor who will solidify the defensive line.

Nascimento hopes his squad can continue to build the program and increase that win total once again. \Any year we can progress and just tack some more W\s on, that\s a successful season. That\s what we\re looking to do,\ said Nascimento. \We do have somewhat of a veteran group. These kids got some wins under their belt last year. We\re very hopeful for this season. These kids keep getting better and better and they continue to show up, regardless of the outcome.\ Nascimento likes the experience he has at the skill positions, particularly at wide receiver, where junior Myles Olivier and seniors Jose Lopes and Damien Antoine lead the way. Senior offensive lineman John Ferrara and junior running back Anthony Derienzo also star on offense. Senior Adrian Pineda is in line to replace former GBL All-Star Reggie Thelemaque at quarterback.\n\n Division 4 South\n Dave McSweeney (7th season)\n 7-4\n Depth, work ethic.\n Inexperience at the varsity level.\n Artificial turf\n Medway is entering this season still searching for the school\s first post-season berth. The loss of key seniors on the offensive line including 6-4, 285-pound Kevin Sheehan and 6-5, 290-pound Cam Smith will be hard to overcome, but McSweeney has confidence in the players he has. \We have only 13 seniors so there are a lot of open jobs. Will have to see how it plays out,\ McSweeney said. \Based on what I\ve seen the kids are very competitive. They are open to coaching and are willing to do whatever is necessary for them to improve. We are young but will hopefully make up for that with effort, attitude, and hard work.\ With senior Greg Danehy at quarterback and senior Greg Metelus at running back, Medfield will have a strong backfield. Seniors Matt Ahearn and Connor Graves will try to fill the voids left by Sheehan and Smith on the offensive line.\n\n Division 3NW North\n Tim Morris (21st season)\n 10-2\n Starters at nine positions returning. Skill positions with some nice experience, including WR and secondary.\n QB, both lines, and linebacker.\n Artificial turf\n The best thing Melrose has going for them is that they have several seniors slotted all around the field. This was a good team that has a lot of upside if it\s younger players can mesh and perform well with the returners. The Melrose defense gave up a league low 13.8 ppg last fall.\n\n Division 1 North\n Tom Ryan (2d season)\n 6-5\n Offensive line.\n Depth at skill positions.\n Grass\n Ryan fared well in his first year as head coach, winning his first four games and finishing the season 6-5. This year he returns MVC All-Conference offensive lineman Kyle Whittaker, who anchors a unit that Ryan considers the biggest strength of his team. Defensive end Nick Comerford is expected to contribute heavily as well. Mike Baglieri will play quarterback for Methuen. \He\s a real tough, gritty kid,\ Ryan said of Baglieri. Methuen has a legitimate shot to finish in the upper half of its league if all goes according to plan.\n\n Division 4 South\n Pat Kingman (4th season)\n 5-6\n Leadership, experience.\n Defense.\n Grass\n After a cool end to the month of August and a pre-Labor Day school start, the Sachems are more than ready for the 2014 football season. With a team of 17 seniors, Kingman has been with the majority of this team from the beginning. \They know what\s expected,\ said Kingman. \Things are running smoother than they ever had.\ On offense, they\ll be led by seniors Casey Tucker and Paul Sances, and junior running back, Eddie Hart. Last season, the Sachems were second in the Patriot Fisher League with 26.1 points per game, while holding opposing teams to just 19.8 points per game. Senior defensive end and former quarterback Cody DiBiase will look to cause havoc in opposing backfields with his speed and vision. \I hope everyone is ready to go,\ said Kingman. \It\s football time in Middleborough.\\n\n Division 3SW South\n Joe Todd (2d season)\n 2-9\n Enthusiasm and depth.\n Injuries on the line.\n Grass\n Milford struggled in the competitive Hokcomock Davenport last fall finishing in fifth place.

The Mohawks lost in the Division 6 South final a year ago and return this season boasting a ton of size and strength on both the offensive and defensive lines. Junior lineman Pete Fallon (6-4, 260 pounds) is being recruited by Division 1 schools and will help to fill the hole left by former All-Scholastic lineman Jon Baker (Boston College). \We\re very big on the lines,\ said Olson. \But you can\t replace Jon, he was a once-in-a-lifetime player.\ Senior captain and quarterback Matt Fogarty and junior running back Josh Pierre-Charles will lead the offense. Depth is a concern for Olson, whose team returns eight starters on each side of the ball. The team\s co-op program with Hopedale has been dissolved, but the remaining seven Hopedale players will be allowed to finish their careers with the Mohawks. \We have seven Hopedale kids that have been grandfathered in,\ said Olson. \Once they\ve graduated, the program will become completely Millis.\\n\n Division 3SW South\n Jim Bowes (6th season)\n 5-6\n Experience.\n Replacing key players.\n Artificial turf\n The Wildcats will have to replace a handful of league all stars from last year\s squad.But senior Jonathan Pierre, a running back and cornerback, will return for Milton and will look to make an impact on both sides of the ball. The Wildcats benefit from playing league powerhouse Natick at home, as the Wildcats went 4-1 on their own turf last season. The team faces early tests when they take on Hockomock powers Stoughton and Mansfield to start the season.\n\n Division 6 North\n Brian Tildsley (7th season)\n 8-3\n Attitude and youth.\n Loss of seniors (15 to graduation).\n Grass\n Last year, the Mustangs made their return the Commonwealth Small a successful one by chalking up the school\s most wins (8) since 1986. Zahir Ramsey wrapped up a stellar career for the Mustangs last season, finishing with 1,778 yards of offense and the most points in Division 6 (23 Touchdowns and 18 Conversions). As a four year starter, Ramsey racked up 277 tackles while leading the team to 25 Victories. This year, Tildsley retursn a very inexperienced group, having lost 15 seniors to graduation. The Team will be led by QB Brian Haddock, whose brother Joe was a 3 year starter for Tildsley from 2009-2012. Defensively, the Mustangs will be anchored by Agyei Alfred, a 250-pound junior who has been starting since his freshman year. \We know what we are up against this year with the loss of Zahir and those guys, but so far it looks like these young kids are willing to take the challenge. For the coaching staff, the goal will be to get better each and every week. We will never be unprepared for any opponents\ said Tildsley.\n\n Division 6 South\n Terrence Roche (2d season)\n 3-7\n Offensive line.\n Depth.\n Artificial turf\n Now in its second year as a full-fledged varsity program, the Sharks have gotten used to the grind of the season and will be looking for their first league win. The Sharks will utilize a spread offense, and with three returning linemen, they\ll have strength in the trenches. Also returning to the offense will be the dynamic senior, Dalton Nickerson. Though the 6-0, 215-pounder lines up at tight end, he can play halfback and fullback, adding a running threat to the offense. Defensive end Patrick Kampersal will be a player to watch on the other side of the ball. At 6-3, he has long arms to tie up receivers at the line, but has the ability to shed blocks when needed. \The kids have been working hard,\ said Roche. \We are looking to make the next step as a program. There\s a lot of positivity going on at Monomoy Regional. We\d like to represent them in a positive way.\\n\n Division 6 North\n Craig Turner (2d season)\n 3-7\n Skill positions, experience, team athleticism.\n Depth on the offensive line.\n Artificial turf\n Turner got his first shot at coaching last season and it immediately paid dividends for the Eagles, who finished the season with two more wins than they had the season before. Turner is confident his team\s progress will continue as he\s already seen a """,

Ryder is instituting a more aggressive system with a """,
3572,Erica Pereira,"""family-like atmosphere based on core values.""",
3573,Erica Pereira,""" The squad has a plethora of returning starters, including quarterback Andrew Ray. Nantucket has a bye-week Week 1, which Ryder says is a benefit to the team as it works to adjust to the new system.\n\n Division 2 South\n Mark Mortarelli (5th season)\n 10-1\n Knowledgable seniors at all positions, return of Brian Dunlap.\n Inexperienced linemen on both sides of the ball.\n Artificial turf\n Although former Natick quarterback and Division 2 Player of the Year Troy Flutie has moved on to Boston College, Mortarelli knows his offense still has the potential to be as lethal as it was last season. Senior wideout Brian Dunlap returns after missing the entire 2013 season with a fractured foot. As a sophomore, Dunlap led the state with 86 catches for 1,550 yards and 23 touchdowns and was named an All-Scholastic. Mortarelli also expects the Redhawks to benefit from a senior class that knows the system even if they haven\t played many snaps, and said he just wants his team to protect the ball and stay healthy. \We\re looking to start strong,\ Mortarelli said. \Our goal is to beat Weymouth and go from there.\\n\n Division 3SE South\n Keith Kenyon (5th season)\n 6-5.\n Offensive and defensive lines.\n Inexperience, lack of depth.\n Artificial turf\n The Nauset Warriors Booster Club raised $650,000 to install a new turf field. Kenyon, who also serves as athletic director, said the process started in January and the field was finished the last week of July. Kenyon thought his team, which went 6-5 last year, had good depth heading into the preseason. However, the Warriors suffered five or six injuries during the past few weeks, which Kenyon said may hurt them going forward. Nauset\s biggest threat is fullback and strong safety Kyle Cambone, a 5-foot-8, 165-pound senior. Cambone, who was an Atlantic Coast All-Star last season, will likely emerge as one of the most explosive players in the conference this year. Senior tight end/linebacker Razz Green is a large target at 6-foot-3, 200 pounds. \He\s had a very good preseason both catching the ball and playing defense as an outside linebacker for us,\ Kenyon said of Green. Austin Ziemba, Nick McCarthy, Aiden Keene, and Mike Walsh will also be important pieces of the puzzle for a Nauset team that has high expectations.\n\n Division 2 South\n David Duffy (19th season)\n 7-4\n Size on both lines, teamwork, and enthusiasm.\n Skill positions.\n Artificial turf\n Duffy said that if his skill position players step up as the season progresses, he has no doubt the Rockets can win the league again. However, the coach also realizes how tall of a task it is to replace All-Scholastic running back Michael Panepinto, who led Div. 2 with 27 touchdowns. \I see a therapist once in the morning, once in the afternoon and they tell me forget about replacing him,\ Duffy said. A majority of the carries will likely go to seniors Jack Roque Jr. and Lucas Goldman.\n\n Division 1 South\n Mark DeBrito (1st season)\n 5-6\n Depth.\n Inexperience at skill positions.\n Artificial turf\n DeBrito makes his coaching debut for the defending Big Three champions. DeBrito, formerly the offensive coordinator, hopes his team can build on its success from last season. """,

3585,Erica Pereira,""" The Clippers have some notable returners who can help the new players get adjusted to the next level. Quarterback Michael Shay returns along with receivers J.J. Bajko and Ty Therrien. The Clippers also have three returners on the offensive line: Reed Nation, Seamus Sullivan, and Peter Greene. A bye week to begin the season should help the younger players up to speed.\n\n Division 1 South\n Peter Capodilupo (31st season)\n 5-6\n Receivers, quarterback, and overall passing game.\n Experience on offensive and defensive line.\n Artificial turf\n The Tigers have all the skill players in place to put up big numbers this season, which led Capodilupo to switch from an offense centered on the I-formation to the spread. However, the coach says his team will only go as far as the offensive and defensive lines allow.\n\n Division 2 North\n Ted Dalicandro (9th season)\n 3-8\n Quarterback, athleticism and experience on defense.\n Depth in the offensive line.\n Artificial turf\n Dalicandro believes the Lions can compete with the top teams in the DCL Large. He may be right based on the work sophomore quarterback Austin Burton in the offseason. In July, Burton attended the invite-only Football University (taught by former NFL players)at Westwood High.\n\n Division 2 North\n John Rafferty (14th season)\n 5-6\n Large senior class, experience at many positions.\n Depth.\n Artificial turf\n Rafferty used one word to sum up last season: Frustrating. \We were hoping to achieve a little bit better success,\ he said. \Finishing off at 5-6 is sub. 500. That\s not what we\re striving for.\ Rafferty points to games against Andover, Waltham, and Masconomet, all of which North Andover lost in the final minute by one or two points. So going into this year, his main goal is to ensure that his team is prepared to finish games with conviction. \If we finished out those games our record would have been significantly different,\ he said. \That\s a goal of ours, to finish.\ Some key players for the Scarlet Knights are slot receiver Robert Shkliew, offensive lineman Yanni Falaras and sophomore quarterback Seamus Lambert. Rafferty feels as though his starters are reliable and proven for the most part, but his biggest concern is what North Andover would do if it suffered a key injury.\n\n Division 3SW South\n Don Johnson (6th season)\n 6-5\n Depth.\n Staying healthy.\n Grass\n Johnson\s team was plagued by injuries last year, resulting in many underclassmen getting varsity reps. That should benefit the team when they come out of the gate this year with those players, such as running backs Sean Gimler and junior Nick Morrison. However, it can\t be a good sign that senior captain Brendan Weir is already out of action after having off-season surgery on a torn labrum in his hip.\n\n Division 3SW South\n Mark Nutley (2d season)\n 3-8\n Experience.\n Offensive line, depth.\n Artificial turf\n After a promising summer camp, the Red Raiders hope it translates to success in the Patriot Fisher. Nearly all of last year\s starters will return on the offense, including Andrew Kiley, their 6-3 quarterback. Junior wide receiver Aiden Brown and RB Dayvon Jones will look to fit in the single back system with a combination of hands and speed. On the defensive side of the ball, they\ll have seven returning starters, including middle linebacker, Zach Dangora. Dangora led his team in tackles, despite missing two games. \We\re excited about the guys coming back,\ said Nutley. \Guys playing together for two years, it helps out.\\n\n Division 4 North\n Jeff Wall (12th season)\n 7-4\n Discipline, work ethic and senior leadership.\n Depth and inexperience.\n Artificial turf\n The Hornets enter the season with an abundance of senior leadership.

Inexperience at the skill positions are a concern, but Heres is confident in the return of league MVP Kevin Rosado on offense. The Knights also welcome back returnees Pedro DelToro, Walter Campos, and Robert Newhook on defense.\n\n Division 4 South\n Tim McCarthy (1st season)\n 8-3\n Offensive and defensive lines.\n Depth at the skill positions.\n Grass\n The Lancers won the the league a year ago, and with 11 returning starters (five on defense and six on offense) and a new head coach in McCarthy, they are in good position to make it two in a row. \The goal is to stay in the thick of things in the league,\ said McCarthy, who was an assistant at Norton the last two years.\xa0\If our younger players develop quickly, we will compete for another championship.\ Junior running back Justin Ireland \will shoulder the load carrying the ball,\ according to McCarthy. Junior wide receiver/safety Jake Eberle will be another high-impact player to watch for.\n\n Division 5 South\n Jim Connor (2d season)\n 6-5\n Returning 10 starters, nine of whom start both ways.\n Replacing key players and team speed.\n Artificial turf\n In his first year at Norwell, Connor barely missed bringing the Clippers to the playoffs. With excellent leaders returning in 2014, Connor expects to compete for the South Shore title. Senior captain Dan Hilson will see most of the touches at running back after gaining 800 yards last season in a back-up role. Junior Kris Kellaway has earned the quarterback job and will be looking to connect with Joey Volte, who led the team in receiving last year with 600 yards. Other returning starters who will play a key role include Matt Macauley, Max Walls, Jack Brown, Zack Carey (captain), James Reilly, and Jack Marsico.\n\n Division 3SW South\n John Sarianides (5th season)\n 1-10\n Returning players.\n Inexperience.\n Grass\n After a dismal season last year, a young Mustangs team with another year of experience under its belt will look to turn things around in 2014. Norwood will have plenty of power in the ground game with the return of junior running back Zac Pungitore, a league All Star. The Mustangs will need to put up points against league rivals this season if they want to improve upon last year\s campaign, when the Mustangs went 0-5 against fellow Bay State Herget teams.\n\n Division 6 North\n Kevin Gadson (7th season)\n 8-3\n Coaching staff, senior leadership.\n Youth, inexperience, loss of skill players.\n Artificial turf\n The Tigers started last season 8-0 before injuries hampered the tail-end of their season. The loss of starting QB Ajani Alfred-McFall and tough runner Mehki Williams just highlights the team\s need for skill-position talent to step up. And having only three returning starters does not make it any easier for them. In what seems to be a rebuilding year, a term Gadson would rather not use, the Tigers will need to """,

But young talent or not, Gadson and his staff do a great job of getting all players on the same page and ready to go.\n\n Division 6 South\n Bryce Guilbeault (3d season)\n 3-8.\n Experience in seven returning starters.\n Depth. Injuries during preseason.\n Grass\n Guilbeault hopes his squad is the best conditioned in the league as it pursues its goal of winning one game at a time to put itself in a position to compete at the end of the season. While he\s worried about the depth of his squad (he only had 31 players come out for football this season), he\s impressed with the group\s work ethic and dedication. Look out for sophomore running back Ryan Baker to use his speed to make big plays for Old Colony.\n\n Division 5 South\n Henry Quinlan (11th season)\n 10-1\n Enough quality talent throughout the lineup to be competitive in the conference.\n Experience and depth.\n Grass\n The Bulldogs had a terrific 2013 campaign, sweeping conference and regular season play, while making a run to the Division 5 South final. They should contend for another SCC Large crown despite graduating 14 players, including All-Scholastic TE/LB Haydon Bergeron. Senior quarterback Alex Aruri (captain) will lead an attack spear-headed by 2013 SCC All-Star tailback Darien Dumond (Jr.) and senior Raekwon Phillips. Senior captain Gerald Lanagan (LB/C) will lead a defense that allowed only 14.8 points per game in 2013. Returning starters Kyle Henry (OT/DL), Hunter Cooney (WR/DB), and Jarrett Johnston (TE/OLB) will play huge roles for the Bulldogs, along with senior Ethan Lizotte (RB/LB) who missed all of 2013 with an injury.\n\n Division 3SW South\n James Artz (9th season)\n 10-1\n Skill positions and linebackers.\n offensive and defensive line.\n Artificial turf\n Fresh off recording the school\s first undefeated regular season since 1964 and a trip to the South Division 3 Southwest finals, Oliver Ames is certainly hungry for more. Losing All-Scholastic quarterback Nick Cidado certainly hurts, but the team does return its entire wide receiving corps. Defensively, the Tigers will be led by returning Hockomock All-Star Joe Tepper. \I\m hoping we\re a physical defensive team that flies to the ball,\ said Artz.\n\n Division 1 North\n Marc Bettencourt (2d season)\n 3-8\n Positive attitude.\n Depth and injuries.\n Grass\n In his first year at the helm, Bettencourt had the challenge of transforming a winless team and he ended the season on a positive note with the Tanners\ 3-8 record. Peabody hasn\t had a winning season in the NEC since coming over from the GBL in 2007. With a new new artificial turf, Coley Lee Field, and momentum in their favor, the Tanners show great promise.\n\n Division 3SE South\n Robert Bancroft (32d season)\n 5-5\n Backfield.\n Inexperience on the offensive line.\n Artificial turf\n With only seven returning starters, the Titans will look to focus on the fundamentals and taking things one game at a time in the coming season. A young, inexperienced offensive line will be tested early on, which is a major focus point for Bancroft. \We\ve got to find our line. We need to get people in there and get the experience,\ he said. In the backfield, the return of 6-3, 210-pound running back, Kyle Horn and Khadir Bullock should help PHS on the ground and in the air. Senior quarterback Bill Watts will look to take on the role as starter. The secondary and linebackers appear to be in good shape, but it\s the defensive line that is the focus. \The kids know we have a lot of work to be a good football team,\ said Bancroft. Despite that, he said there is optimism in the air. \The kids have been upbeat. We\re not focusing on the negative. We\re working on getting better all the time,\ Bancroft said.\n\n Division 4 North\n Steve Hayden (33d season)\n 8-2\n Senior leadership.\n Depth and inexperience on offensive line.\n Grass\n The Sachems\ offense will rely on the running game. They have a three-headed ground attack with captains Jeff Porter, Josh Wesolowski, and Andrew Noyes all sharing carries.

They\ll return eight starters, four on defense and four on offense. Despite a lack of experience, Fry said overall team speed and athleticism are strengths for his team. Fullback Justin Lamb (6-1, 215 pounds) will look to fill Oxsen\s shoes in the team\s I-form offense. Two-way all-league player, Zach Tilson (6-5, 250 pounds) will be a player to watch on defense, as he can be quick off the line for a player of his size. \It\s an enthusiastic group that has worked hard all summer,\ Fry said. \This is one of the teams that will get better week to week.\\n\n Division 6 South\n John Muldoon (4th season)\n 8-3\n Overall depth, experience at skill positions.\n Staying focused.\n Artificial turf\n The Lions led EMass in scoring last season with 42.8 points per game, failing only twice (both losses) to break the 40-point mark. The team returns all of their offensive weapons, including strong-armed and accurate quarterback Ryan Barabe, who tossed 27 touchdown passes a season ago, and bruising running back Diego Meritus, who finished 4th in division 6 with 21 TDs and 140 points.

Leading the Quincy offense will be senior quarterback James Lam, who ran for 10 touchdowns a year ago and added five through the air. The Presidents also bring back All-League junior tailback Jahvae Handsom-Fields who had three games with 175+ yards a year ago.

Fiore says DiLoreto has a strong arm and is a broad-shouldered, tall quarterback. At running back, the Rockets will rely on steady production from 5-foot-9, 178-pound junior D\Aundray Burcy. Fiore calls Burcy a good downhill runner who has breakaway speed. Senior wide receivers Joe Pappalardo and Will Murray will also likely be key contributors.

He\s still getting acclimated to the job but knows he has an experienced group. O\Connell and his team participated in a three-way camp with Mashpee and Old Rochester earlier this summer. He said the camp benefited both the players and coaches and that it was a great way to help him get adjusted. Dan Perry, a senior defensive end, will anchor the Blue Warriors\ defense, a unit that allowed 21.7 points per game last season. O\Connell called Perry one of the best defensive players in the league, and he\s confident Perry will continue to build off an impressive junior campaign.

The Sachems return 15 lettermen, all of whom saw substantial playing time last season. Justin Winn returns at quarterback along with Dan Cacciola at running back. Steven Whitehurst, Luke Surette, and Brendan Grocki are all returners on the offensive line and are all two-way players. Grocki and Surette play linebacker while Whitehurst plays defensive tackle.

Senior quarterback Christian Brady can run and throw with precision in the spread offense. The loss of Dawayne Kirton will be a big one for Scituate, but the 5-10, 200-pound Chris Bearce will look to fill Kirton\s shoes at running back. Defensive tackle Devin McCarthy (6-2, 355 pounds) has speed off the ball, and will look to cause problems in opposing backfields.

It’s virtually impossible to say something new about “The Great Gatsby,” and Maureen Corrigan doesn’t really try to in her appealing, if unfocused book “So We Read On.” Instead, she offers “a personal excursion into the novel I love more than any other,” narrated in the engaging, conversational tone familiar from her book reviews on National Public Radio’s “Fresh Air.” She wants to be accessible, but Corrigan flashes her highbrow credentials too: She refers frequently to the literature courses she teaches at Georgetown and occasionally indulges in academic-style lists (“subjects that I’ll be exploring,” “peculiarities of ‘The Great Gatsby’\u2009”) that read like preliminary notes for the seminar on “Gatsby” she has not yet persuaded the university to fund. Her effort to be simultaneously intellectual and colloquial leads to some jarring phrasemaking — “It’s not the green light, stupid; it’s Gatsby’s reaching for it that’s the crucial all-American symbol.” — and this inclusive ethos, though commendable, makes the text rather scattershot.\n\t\nCorrigan devotes chapters to the novel’s water imagery and its affinities with hard-boiled detective fiction and film noir.

At the end of the day, kids are learning, and the MCAS will show that out.”Veronica Soto, who grew up in Lawrence and has two children at the Wetherbee K-8 School, said she is impressed with the added rigor.“They work hard in keeping kids focused and preparing them for the MCAS,” she said. “The homework is challenging them more, but not to the point that they give up. .\xa0.\xa0. People feel more proud to be part of the system.”There have been bumps along the way, though. Early on, Riley upset the teachers union by firing some teachers. Tensions arose as contract negotiations dragged on for more than two years before a deal was struck this year.Otherwise, relationships between Riley and the teachers union have been good, said union president Frank McLaughlin, who contends corrupt politicians and not poor academic performance landed the system in receivership.“Lawrence is a gateway city, the new Ellis Island,” McLaughlin said. “We have a student population that primarily comes from the Dominican Republic who are here looking for what our parents wanted, the American Dream.”The Leonard was among the worst schools in the city when the state came in, prompting Riley to bring in UP Education Network, an education nonprofit, to help run the school. It is one of several schools overseen by a partner, including one operated by the city’s teachers union.The school eventually replaced all its teachers, extended its hours, overhauled academic programs, instituted uniforms, and set strict discipline policies. Test scores are climbing and discipline problems are dropping, even as a steady flow of immigrant students enroll during the school year.Mariallette Batista, an eighth-grader, arrived at the Leonard two years ago from the Dominican Republic not knowing how to speak English.“The first thing I recognize was that every teacher was supporting me, showing me how to do homework and telling me never to give up,” Batista said.On the other side of Broadway, the Guilmette Elementary School is achieving so much academic growth the state considers it among the best in Massachusetts.Principal Lori Butterfield said a big factor in the school’s success was the power to “organically” develop an educational plan, rather than following districtwide mandated curriculums. The apprehension that many teachers and administrators had about receivership has subsided, she said.“The last two or three years have been the best experience in my professional career,” said Butterfield. “It’s not like Jeff came in and said everything was bad. Largely, it was what’s working and what can we do to build that up. That was a surprise. Schools got empowered.”
 If you want to know which Massachusetts schools make the biggest difference in the lives of their students, it’s in the 2014 MCAS results released this morning. The number they call “student growth percentile” is designed to measure the impact of schools.  It doesn’t look at how well students are doing on tests. It looks at how much they’ve improved. The schools with high “student growth percentile” are the ones full of kids who are learning faster and improving more rapidly than their peers around the state.\n\n\t\nJudging from the student growth scores, here are six of the schools that did the most to help students learn, across Math and English, in 2014. These aren’t necessarily the places with the smartest kids or the highest-achievers. At UP Academy Charter School of Dorchester less than two-thirds actually met the proficiency standards. At Henry K. Oliver, just one in four students is proficient in science or math. But students at these schools are seeing the biggest improvements on their MCAS scores. \nOne caveat here is that a fair number of elementary schools don’t get student growth percentiles, because there isn’t enough information yet to make the calculation for younger kids.  \nThe idea is relatively straightforward. Let’s say there’s a kid who scores 250 on the third-grade English test. A year later, when she takes the fourth-grade test, you can compare her new score with other kids around the state who got 250 last time. If she does better, she’s growing. And if her school has lots of students outperforming their one-time peers, that’s a sign that the school is making a difference.The student growth measure was introduced in 2009 to help provide a more accurate assessment of classroom impact. The trouble with more familiar measures, like overall test scores, is that they don’t necessarily tell you much about the quality of schools. High test scores can also reflect the wealth of the surrounding community, the likelihood that kids get tutors, the educational background of parents, and other socio-economic factors. \nThey did more or less as well as as they did last year. The only exception was the eighth grade, where there was a a slight increase in science proficiency and a dip in math.Looking back over the past few years, there’s been very little growth in the share of students who meet or exceed the grade-level proficiency standards.\n\nNothing substantial. Between rich and poor, white and black, the achievement gap remains quite wide.  \nFor years now, closing these achievement gaps has been a leading state and national priority. It would be possible to use the student growth measures to determine which approaches are working best, and then to spread those practices around the state.  One place to start would be with the schools that seem to be doing the best job with low-income students.\n\n
Cheers erupted Friday morning in the gymnasium of the Jeremiah Burke High School after students learned that the Burke would become the first high school in the state to shed its “underperforming” designation.“This is a historic moment,” said Headmaster Lindsa McIntyre, speaking from a microphone as she addressed the students at the Dorchester school. “Not only have we earned a place as a competitive institution in the city of Boston but also in the state.”\n\t\nThe news came with the release of the statewide.The juniors and seniors who gathered in the gymnasium gave each other high-fives. Some began chanting the school’s cheer, while others danced as music pulsated over the loud speakers.“Honestly, it makes me feel like anything is possible,” said Brandon Newton, 17, a senior, from Mattapan. Newton recalled how his friends reacted when he first got assigned to the Burke four years ago, saying, “ ‘Oh, man, you are going to the Burke -- why would you do that to yourself?’ ”Initially, the put-downs got to him, Newton said. But the longer he stayed at the school, the more he appreciated the teachers and staff, the academic programs, and other resources. It’s the kind of experience that many students recount about the Burke.The school has long been the litmus test for the quality of education in Boston. During a State of the City address in the Burke’s auditorium in 1996, then-Mayor Thomas M. Menino famously challenged city residents to “judge me harshly” if his overhaul of the city’s schools failed.Through Menino’s time in office, the Burke went through cycles of progress and decline. Many students at the school, located on Washington Street, have been touched by violence. About 80 percent come from low-income households and 30 percent are learning to speak English, according to state data.The state declared the Burke underperforming in March 2010 -- one of 35 schools statewide to receive that designation under a law passed two months earlier. The law gave school districts the ability to get around teacher union contracts to implement longer days and other changes at these kinds of schools.McIntyre had been headmaster for just a few months. The Burke has always had a special place for her. It is where she started her teaching career “years ago.”The Burke overhauled its academic programs -- emphasizing individualized instruction for each student -- and closely analyzed test scores, course work, and other data to adjust instructional practices to help ensure students graduate. It also formed a partnership with service organization City Year to crack down on truancy. McIntyre said the staff never forgot that each data point represented a name and a face, as staff strived to build a sense of community throughout the building.\n scores rose sharply. In English, 62 percent of 10th-graders scored advanced or proficient last spring, double the percentage from five years ago. In math, 71 percent met that benchmark, up from 41 percent five years ago. And in science, 36 percent scored proficient or higher, up from 1 percent five years ago.The four-year graduation rate also climbed to 56.8 percent in 2013, up from 41.1 percent in 2009, according to the most recent state data available.Students repeatedly said Friday that it was the sense of community that kept them at the Burke. Students affectionately call McIntyre “Ms. Mac.”“This school is a family,” said Elis Perez, 17, a junior from Dorchester. “We are here for each other.”“The teachers helped us out all the way,” said Deonte Young, 17, a senior from Roxbury.Filomena Cabral, the school’s registrar, said that when she heard the good news Friday morning she exclaimed, “We delivered a baby.”“Now we are going to make this baby grow and get big,” she said.Indeed, McIntyre warned students after the announcement that the Burke could not rest on its laurels. She wants the school to climb to the highest level in the state’s school accountability system, a level 1. The school is now at Level 3. But for now, McIntyre is savoring the victory with a big smile -- and some tears.“It’s been a long road,” she said, “but a great one.”
LOWELL — The play is about young Cambodians living in Long Beach, Calif., in 2003. The main characters include a gangbanger fresh out of prison — the self-proclaimed “world’s largest Cambodian” — and a teenage comic book fan who loves his imitation Fruit Loops. F-bombs drop left and right, and the music mixes chill beats with traditional Asian sounds.From that description, \nyou might guess the show was produced by Company One Theatre, which specializes in the young, diverse, and pop culture-obsessed. But “Year Zero” is the season-opener for Merrimack Repertory Theatre, which is smartly using it to connect with Lowell’s Cambodian community, the largest in the United States after Long Beach. There’s a whole schedule of discussions, film screenings, and Cambodian dance performances to accompany the production.\n\t\nDespite its fresh cultural trappings, though, the script seems to prove that stories about immigrants assimilating tend to be alike.  Whatever positive messages they may carry, it makes the drama a little too predictable. “Year Zero” refers to the Khmer Rouge’s goal of purging the existing culture and restarting Cambodian civilization after its brutal takeover in 1975. Many of the Cambodians who survived the genocide of millions of their countrymen during that time immigrated to America.At 16, Vuthy (Daniel Velasco) talks like a “Big Bang Theory” geek, treating superheroes and “Star Trek” references with a grave seriousness, in part as an escape from the bullying he gets from the Samoans at his high school.Vuthy was raised by his mother, a genocide survivor who ran a convenience store in Long Beach, and she has just died as the play opens. Vuthy’s older sister Ra (Juliette Hing-Lee), who got out of the neighborhood to become a pre-med student at Berkeley, has come home to box up their mother’s things before packing Vuthy off to live with a relative across town.Their grieving — and bickering — are interrupted by Han (Michael Rosete), a burly but sensitive neighbor who just got out of jail. Their mother more or less raised Han, too. He’s the only one who knows what happened to her in the killing fields,  and he feels responsible for Vuthy and Ra.Enter Glenn (Arthur Keng), Ra’s Chinese-American live-in boyfriend at school, a perky radiologist who surprises her by driving down to help pack up the house. Glenn is fully yuppified — he got a big laugh at Sunday’s matinee by asking the location of the nearest Banana Republic. He’s also one of the more predictable components of Michael Golamco’s play, which premiered at the Victory Gardens Theater in Chicago in 2009.I’d better issue a spoiler alert for the rest of this paragraph, but despite the harrowing back story, you’ll hardly be surprised by the “Year Zero” plot twists: Han and Ra secretly dated in high school, and their romance rekindles behind Glenn’s back. Han tries to toughen up Vuthy, and Ra fears he’s leading her brother down a dangerous path. And while Han says he’s going straight, of course there’s one last, dangerous job he has to do for the neighborhood gang, despite Ra’s pleas. We’ve seen this movie before, seemingly down to the tank top Han wears, just like tough Italian and Latino guys in earlier incarnations of this story.Velasco makes a convincing teenager, ricocheting from childlike gamer to raging adolescent to perceptive near-adult in the space of a couple sentences. He conveys his character’s intense frustration as he attempts to cope. Hing-Lee lets us see Ra’s determination and her sorrow. But the gem here is Rosete’s assured, unshowy performance as Han, who is confident in his toughness but knows the street is not all there is. Keng makes a good comic Glenn in the first act but is less successful in conveying the character’s other dimensions in the second act. But that, too, may be the fault of the script. Hing-Lee and Velasco also have a hard time keeping up with the rapid shifts of emotion. And some of the speeches Golamco has written for them land too much on the nose.The last thing a play about rebirth should have is a character standing near the edge of the stage proclaiming that “eventually everyone gets reborn.”
As planes took off over Boston Harbor one summer evening, artist Liz LaManche was bent at the waist, outlining a 50-foot dragon on the concrete surface of an East Boston pier. “Holy smokes, it’s amazing,” said a resident as she walked home to her houseboat, docked at the pier. She pointed at the dragon’s mouth. “Great teeth,” she noted.LaManche’s dragon looks like a tattoo. And it is a tattoo, one that adorns a long and narrow pier, rather than a bicep or calf. On Saturday, the entire length and width of that pier at 256 Marginal St. will be tattooed for East Boston’s annual HarborArts Festival. It is the centerpiece exhibit of the daylong event, and LaManche has been out there working on it three evenings a week for three months. By Saturday, 19 tattoos, representing 19 countries or cultures, will cover the dock.\n\t\nLaManche said she wants to include “all of the different cultures Boston has been connected to by sea.”Her dragon, for example, is an amalgamation of images she found on the plates and dishes that once arrived to Boston on trade ships from China. Because sailors learned tattooing in the Pacific Islands, she collaborated with a Maori artist from New Zealand to design a Maori tattoo, which is also complete.She made a 9-foot paper stencil to draw the middle portion of an intricate Irish knot tattoo, perching a projector on a ladder one evening to trace its edges.Outline complete, fellow artists started volunteering their time to help fill it in with black cement stain.“This is my chance to get out,” said Joseph Rodgers as he painted the Irish tattoo this summer. Rodgers, who works inside most days as a finishing carpenter, lives in a boat at the pier. He got to chatting with LaManche in the evenings when he passed by and soon offered to paint. He is moving this fall to Maine, where he will design and build his own house. He said he might install a concrete dock-inspired patio as well, a place to enjoy the evenings.A few Boston-area artists came out to help each evening, getting free beer and grapes in return. “You couldn’t ask for a better studio,” said Jenn Zawadzkas, who organized the FIGMENT arts event on the Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy Greenway in July.After all of the administrative work that comes with organizing a festival, she was happy “just to do something so concrete, you could say.”LaManche, like her volunteers, received no payment for her work on the dock tattoos. She launched a $4,373 Kickstarter campaign to meet her costs.The Somerville resident, who holds a bachelor’s degree in architecture from Yale and a master’s in social work from Smith College and has her own computer graphics and software interface design business.She said she got the idea for the tattoos over a year ago and did a test tattoo, titled “New England Sailors,” at last year’s HarborArts festival.Though dock managers and festival organizers had been enthusiastic about the idea all along, LaManche said seeing the public respond to that first tattoo was the moment the project crystallized for her.“I love doing big art because you reach more people,” said LaManche.She spent the winter researching traditional symbols, such as the Celtic knot, from different cultures, and then started drawing. The final tattoo designs represent New England Native Americans, Basque fishermen, West Africans, Brazilians, Russians, the English, and the French, among others.LaManche got a tattoo herself just last December. It is based on a vision of a swirling black-and-white design she said she had when she was 9 or 10 years old. She has considered it her signature ever since, and on her birthday, Dec. 29, she had it tattooed on the back of her neck.She hopes that when the East Boston dock is done, air travelers will be able to see the designs as they take off and depart from Logan Airport.

Boston police seized a loaded gun Friday and arrested a 19-year-old man who was allegedly carrying it in his backpack after a foot chase through Dorchester, according to a statement posted to the Boston Police website. At just after 3 p.m. Friday, gang unit officers on patrol in the area of Bowdoin Street and Geneva Avenue saw two men they believed had information about gun-related incidents in the area, according to the statement. But the two split up when they saw the officers, the statement said, and when police got out of their cruiser, one of them, Livingston Walker, of Boston, allegedly took off running. \n\t\nAs police chased Walker, he allegedly tossed a backpack over a fence on Hamilton Street, according to the statement. Police said they found a silver and black firearm inside the backpack.Officers caught up to Walker, arrested him, and charged him with unlawful possession of a firearm, unlawful possession of ammunition, and carrying a loaded firearm on a public way. So far this year, Boston police have taken 484 illegal guns used in the commission of a crime or confiscated during an arrest off the street, according to the statement. Last year, police seized a total of 667 guns all year. Officials have also collected 385 guns so far this year in the Boston Gun Buyback Program. 
Comedy seemed to come from a wormhole when I was a kid. I consumed outdated media: Looney Tunes cartoons, “Three Stooges” reruns, and comic strips like “Mutt and Jeff” and “Andy Capp.” Their references to castor oil, nutty prophets carrying “The End of the World Is Nigh” signs, poor people wearing barrels, and wives waiting at doorsteps with rolling pins to beat their carousing husbands were meant to be funny, I supposed, but seemed stuck in a time warp — one I didn’t completely understand. Now comes “American Cornball: A Laffopedic Guide to the Formerly Funny,” a clever, discursive, meticulously researched guide to explain all that old-fashioned humor of yesteryear.\n\t\nIn search of “things that used to make Americans laugh,” Christopher Miller is the self-appointed “archaeologist digging into the enormous trash heap of pop culture, down to artifacts that, though still easy to unearth, have been buried long enough to be worth another look.”  How deep does he tunnel? This impressive survey of humor begins around 1900 and cuts off around 1966 — coincidentally, the year I was born. \nMiller is the author of the experimental narratives “The Cardboard Universe: A Guide to the World of Phoebus K. Dank” and “Sudden Noises from Inanimate Objects: A Novel in Liner Notes”; the first reads like an encyclopedia, the second takes on the form of liner notes. Thus, it makes sense that “American Cornball,” though not a novel, would adopt a kindred, compendious format. The handsome and chunky book, arranged A-to-Z, is also generously illustrated with postcards, comics, advertisements, film stills, and other ephemera. Forget (or never knew) what a “bindlestick” is? Miller’s book reminds us in words and pictures: It’s that DIY hanky tied to a stick, the “handy cartoon carryall”  seen in “Little Orphan Annie,” “Li’l Abner,” and a zillion other comics, and especially useful “if you’re a hobo on the road, or a mischievous runaway kid.” \n\nNot only does Miller’s book recount what used to be funny — brainy girls, snoring, psychoanalysts — but he tracks comedy’s cross-pollinations. For example, the entry for “Bowling” connects Fred Flintstone, Ralph Kramden, Ozzie Nelson, Fibber McGee, and Paul Fussell, and it also refers the reader to entries on “Golf,” “Opera,” and “Blowhards.” “Blowhards” (e.g., Foghorn Leghorn, Ignatius J. Reilly in “A Confederacy of Dunces”) references “Inventor,” “Get-Rich-Quick-Schemes,” and “Cowards.” “Blowhards” are also mentioned under the “Absentminded Professors” category.

3891,Lawrence,"""My plan was to write something about the smart new ABC family comedy “Black-ish,” and more broadly about the encouraging signs of greater diversity on TV this fall. Then a New York Times TV critic, in a stunningly clumsy attempt at praise, managed to insult one of television’s most successful showrunners, Shonda Rhimes, by perpetuating the old stereotype of the “.” It was another reminder that on matters of race — on television, in politics, in society, in our conversations with each other — the step forward and the step back often seem to occur simultaneously.\n\t\nBut those steps forward are crucial. And this season, on camera and behind the scenes, a wider spectrum of viewpoints — across cable and broadcast networks (especially ABC), as well as online platforms — offers reasons to be hopeful that the pace of progress can be quickened.While not every show offering a diverse cast or fresh perspective will necessarily be a winner creatively, representation matters. Seeing yourself on screen as a fully fleshed-out human being — be it the young Latino woman on The CW’s “Jane the Virgin,” or the transgender woman on Amazon’s “Transparent,” or any member of the rainbow coalition of gay and straight law students and faculty on ABC’s “How To Get Away With Murder” — is a subliminal message that your presence has been accounted for, and hopefully in a way that isn’t marginal or freakish or stereotypical. With “Black-ish” in particular, the extent of my rooting interest — as a black woman from an (almost) middle-class background — surprised me. The pilot wasn’t perfect but there is something exciting about a show — co-produced by its black stars — that is willing to take on familial, cultural, political, and social issues, in ways that are both universally relatable and specific to black families.While any viewer of shows like “The Jeffersons,” “Good Times,” “The Cosby Show,” or “The Bernie Mac Show” knows that sitcoms featuring black families aren’t new, the integrative feel and approach of “Black-ish” is fresh.I wanted more laughs, but as a viewer I’m enthusiastic about a series that attempts a considerate, complex representation of another flavor of modern family for an underserved audience on mainstream commercial TV. This isn’t an “urban” series or an assimilation series or a treatise about race or oppression — not that theres anything wrong with those — but a show that takes on all of those concepts and more within its premise of a black father struggling to define and maintain his cultural identity for his family. And it still manages to be funny. Laughs can be a great equalizing force in building connections and opening eyes: Just look at Archie Bunker or “Will & Grace.” “Black-ish,” whose premiere last week had strong ratings, bears a similarity to those groundbreaking shows with the balance it strikes between depicting everyday life and showing where everyday life intersects with social issues. The first episode laid out the many complications and contradictions felt by people who’ve “made it” — which isn’t a conundrum reserved for upwardly mobile black people. The pilot suggested that as it goes on, the show will look at the ways in which people of any minority group can live their lives unencumbered by stereotypes some of the time, but not all of the time. It spoke to the idea that there is a constant negotiation that takes place in the characters’ heads and in the way others see them. And that negotiation is something everyone does. The age-old dilemma “Black-ish” confronts of not feeling or being perceived as “black enough” or “too black” — as if such a thing were quantifiable — might apply in other contexts to sexual identity, religion, class, or ethnic heritage. Most of us are negotiating some aspect of who we are when it comes to public perception and personal conviction, and there is rich potential there for both comedy and drama. And on a simpler storytelling level, everyone can relate to family and romantic conflicts about the quotidian details of existence, like the proper way to load the dishwasher. Which brings us back to the Shonda Rhimes/New York Times kerfuffle last week, and the fact that it focused largely on writer Alessandra Stanley’s theory that Rhimes was somehow embracing the “angry black woman” stereotype to subvert it. She singled out the black female characters — including Viola Davis, who stars on “How To Get Away With Murder,” a show produced but not created by Rhimes — as stand-ins for Rhimes herself.  Yet Rhimes’s hit shows — “Grey’s Anatomy,” “Scandal” — have assiduously avoided facile stereotypes and feature multiracial casts that don’t have a singular point of view. On her series, race — or sexuality or class — is an issue when it’s an issue, and isn’t when it isn’t, just like in real life. Anyone can be a doctor, lawyer, crisis fixer, head of a shadowy government organization, international mercenary, etc. Rhimes was so far ahead of the curve with “Grey’s Anatomy” that it seemed she’d reached her own private “post-racial” Shondaland well before there was a black president.  (And as for being angry, as Rhimes’s own characters were once wont to say: Seriously? If you’ve ever watched her shows, everybody gets angry in equal measure and at remarkably similar levels of high dudgeon. But they also love hard, laugh hard, and do bonkers, illegal, and murderous things hard.)That Stanley isn’t alone in her reductive thinking is also no surprise. During a panel discussion for the recently premiered “Murder” this summer at the Television Critics Association press tour in Beverly Hills, a reporter asked Rhimes how she was similar to, or if she admired, Davis’s character, a formidable law professor. Even after she placidly explained she did not create the character of Annalise Keating, so how could she be autobiographical?, similar questions followed, seeming to imply that the only character Rhimes could possibly relate to was that of another black woman.  But instead of worrying about those stuck thinking inside a narrow box, my hope is that this increased scrutiny around the topic will help shift focus to those shows, showrunners, and networks that are finally getting the memo and expanding their palettes. Not all shows are created equal in quality and quality of depiction, and we’ve hardly reached some promised land of perfect balance. There is still work to be done — in the real world and on TV — but it’s nice to see shows like “Black-ish” elevating the dialogue. Hopefully it will succeed creatively and commercially, so that others may join the conversation. \n\n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n""",

A retired guidance department head at Milton High School has been charged with stealing tens of thousands of dollars over several years from the school system, officials said.Kenneth Aubert, 62, of Roslindale, pleaded not guilty to five counts of larceny over $250 in August, said David Traub, a spokesman for Norfolk District Attorney Michael W. Morrissey. \n\t\nAubert is alleged to have taken “roughly $30,000,” Traub said.The charges against Aubert and the investigation surrounding the thefts were announced by Superintendent Mary C. Gormley Wednesday night at the town’s School Committee meeting.The thefts came to the attention of the Milton High staff when “certain records regarding the collection and payment of fees for Advanced Placement tests appeared to be incomplete,” Gormley said in her blog and newsletter to parents and officials.Gormley said the larcenies were connected to collection fees for the tests at the school from 2009 to 2013. Aubert retired from Milton High in the 2012-13 school year, she said.“No students’ scores were impacted, and every AP test was administered,” Gormley said. “The allegations in this case are of theft, theft from the Milton public schools and theft from some students.”The school has also ordered an outside independent review of the system’s practices and procedures, specifically focusing on how cash is handled, she said.Gormley could not be reached for further comment Thursday night.Leroy J. Walker, chairman of the School Committee, referred requests for further comment to the district attorney’s office.Aubert also could not be reached for comment Thursday night. He was released on personal recognizance and is due back in court Oct. 30, Traub said.
Not surprisingly, former mayor Thomas M. Menino claims a host of major political triumphs in his new memoir, “Mayor For A New America.” Most of those are legitimate, but a few may make some observers with long memories scratch their heads. We decided to take a quick look at some of the more questionable assertions.\n\nHe endorsed Attorney General Tom Reilly in the Democratic primary that year, only grudgingly supporting Patrick after he (easily) won the nomination.\n\t\nBut in fact, it’s worse than that. Menino was a major driving force behind Reilly’s decision to nominate Marie St. Fleur, then a state representative from Dorchester, as his running mate. St. Fleur was forced out of the race a day later over personal financial woes, a stumble from which Reilly never recovered.St. Fleur isn’t in the book, by the way.\n\n Menino dragged his feet for months before endorsing Warren. As we all know, Warren won decisively, but Menino never played a major role in the campaign, though some key aides played supportive roles behind the scenes.\n\nMenino was certainly far more gay-friendly than his predecessors, his refusal to march in the St. Patrick’s Day Parade being the most notable example. But this claim is a bit embellished. The only gay man in his inner circle was Harry Collings of the Boston Redevelopment Authority, who appears in nearly every passage in the book involving gay issues.\n\n Menino had chilly relations with the city’s major unions for much of his time in office. Certainly, that partly goes with the territory. Still, at one point, in 2004, he brought in former Senate president Tom Birmingham, a labor lawyer, to help broker peace. There were 32 union contracts outstanding at the time, and he was concerned that union members would embarrass him by picketing at the Democratic National Convention. (Which, indeed, some did.)\n\nMenino’s political army was sent across the border in the last week or so before the primary and knocked on thousands of doors. But a Boston mayor can only do so much in New Hampshire. Clinton’s victory almost certainly had more to do with a strong closing argument in the last 72 hours, and voter skittishness about the then-untested Obama.
More than 40 individuals have expressed interest in becoming the next superintendent of the Boston school system, according to an update presented Thursday night to a search committee.The candidates hail from a wide geographic region, from New Hampshire to Colorado. Almost all are educators, including 23 superintendents, and one is a brigade commander.\n\t\nThursday’s update was the highlight of the first meeting of the search committee since it voted in May to extend the search into this winter amid public concerns that the group was rushing the process.Bill Attea of Hazard, Young, Attea & Associates, the consulting firm hired to vet candidates, gave committee members the update and said that lengthening the search has had no adverse effect on building a strong pool of contenders.“We are really quite pleased with the response,” he said.Attea said none of the initial candidates who expressed interest last spring have withdrawn their applications.Although no names were mentioned, the statement suggests that Massachusetts Education Secretary Matthew Malone remains in the running. The Globe learned of Malone’s candidacy last spring because he was required to file a state conflict of interest disclosure form, which is a public document.Malone’s duties as education secretary put him in a position of potentially funneling money and resources to Boston, which he promised he would not do in the disclosure form.\nThe search committee plans to review and interview candidates during several closed-door meetings in January with a goal of presenting semifinalists to the School Committee later that month or in February. The finalists will eventually be interviewed in public sessions.Three-quarters of the current potential candidates are men. Of the candidates who have completed applications, 13 are white, nine are African-American, and three are Latino.Attea said he expects that some of the best candidates will apply in December to lessen the possibility of having their names leak out, which could create problems at their current jobs.Michael O’Neill, the School Committee chairman, said he expected the search to yield a top-notch slate of candidates.“We are a shining star to a lot of people,” he said of the school system.Ayele Shakur, chairwoman of the education committee of the Boston branch of the NAACP, urged the search panel to keep the public dialogue going. She said “there is a tone of distrust and concern about a lack of transparency around the superintendent search” in the community.She said the search committee could build confidence in the process by appointing one or two community advocates or parents to the group. She also presented the committee with a statement that called for adding a student representative to the panel. Currently there are two parents on the 12-member committee.
AS SUMMER wound down, I e-mailed my closest childhood friend, a distinguished Swedish doctor named Christian Sundberg, to inform him I’d soon be visiting his hometown. He responded that he was “in Sierra Leone at a pediatric emergency hospital in the middle of the biggest Ebola outbreak in recorded history.” The health care systems in West Africa, the epicenter of the current Ebola crisis, have been crippled by the outbreak. Aid workers like Christian risk their lives every day trying to treat the sick and comfort the dying. Many medical professionals — approximately 375 as of Sept. 23 — have contracted the disease themselves. More than 200 have died. \n\n\t\nThe best way we can honor these fearless men and women’s actions is to commit the United States permanently to Africa. As my friend writes, Ebola is “an attack of bioterrorism where the terrorist is Mother Nature.” The United States saw this week that it’s also a disease that can transcend borders. It deserves the same committed fight that America brings to human terrorism.  The continent’s health risks are made worse by the fact that so much of its most impoverished now live in urban areas. Urbanization is the route that leads out of poverty and misgovernment. Yet it is a route filled with risks. Viruses, like goods and ideas, move readily across dense city streets. The cities of the West were also once killing fields. Life expectancy for boys in New York City trailed the national average by seven years in 1901. Today, somewhat miraculously, life expectancies in New York are more than two years greater than the national average. To transform cities from places of contagious death into places of vibrant life, they need infrastructure, human capital, and effective government. President Obama has pledged 3,000 medical workers and up to $750 million in aid to the continent to help in the Ebola fight. But we also need to make long-term investments in less obvious areas like better health education, improved hospitals, and strong democracies — all of which may curb the risk of the next epidemic. \n grew up in the same building in Manhattan in the 1970s, where his father — an overwhelmingly decent man — was the Swedish representative to the UN Security Council. While his mother’s family had resources, Christian’s disdain for material possessions was almost as great as his emphatic bravery. As a 10-year-old, he regularly misplaced his keys, giving him an excuse for entering his 23d floor apartment by jumping James Bond-style from the building’s roof onto the balcony below. That courage was surely tested when his father left New York in 1978 to present his sword as ambassador to the Shah of Iran. When the Islamic revolution followed, Christian had tanks rolling into his living room. Christian escaped Tehran and eventually earned a PhD and a medical degree in Sweden. He came to Boston for a postdoctoral position in cancer research. He has won fancy awards for his research, but he gradually focused more on clinical medicine and started working for Medicins Sans Frontieres, or Doctors without Borders. He now treats patients suffering severe malnutrition at a MSF hospital in Sierra Leone’s Bo district called Gondama Health Clinic, which he and his colleagues are trying their best to keep open in a collapsing health care system that was already stretched before the current Ebola outbreak. He can explain why he does this work better than I can: “It is heartbreaking to see these children who when you first encounter them, you think, ‘How can they be alive?” On the flip side, there are few things as rewarding as assisting these children and seeing how many of them recover in your care.”",

Reports of sexual assaults on area college campuses rose markedly last year, an increase that safety specialists attribute primarily to heightened national awareness of the problem, which prompts more victims to come forward.A survey of information from more than two dozen of the largest New England colleges found that reports of “forcible sex offenses” climbed by 40 percent overall between 2012 and 2013, according to a Globe review of data that colleges provided in annual federally mandated reports released last week.\n\n\t\nLast year, there were a total of 289 reports of the offenses at the colleges. That compares with 206 in 2012. The 2013 total was more than twice as many as reported five years before.\nSexual assaults on and around college campuses, long considered a vastly underreported crime, have received increased attention in recent months from the Obama administration, the schools, and students. As a result, campuses have stepped up training, support, and outreach, and the rising number for 2013 is seen as signaling that victims are more comfortable reporting assaults.“It means that students are coming forward and reporting crimes that are happening and ending that culture of silence,” said Alison Kiss, director of the Clery Center for Security On Campus, a nonprofit that trains colleges to comply with the federal Clery Act.Specialists also believe the spike in reporting may indicate that colleges are becoming more thorough and transparent in collecting and disclosing sexual assault data.At all but four of the campuses in the review, the number of sexual assault reports rose or held steady last year.Hampshire College said its reports of assaults increased from 13 to 20, giving the school the highest rate of sexual assaults per 1,000 students in 2013 — 13.6 — among colleges surveyed by the Globe.The next highest rate was 5.5 assaults at Dartmouth College; the school reported 24 assaults in 2012, and 35 in 2013. The average rate among schools in the survey was 0.99 per 1,000 students in 2013.Diana Fernandez, Hampshire’s coordinator for Title IX, a federal law that mandates gender equality in campus life, attributed the above-average rate at the college to its new efforts to inform students about how to report the crime and about the increased resources available for victims.\n“It’s continued education and really working with the community on that education and training,” Fernandez said.She said Hampshire recently added online training for students on sexual assault prevention. Hampshire has also expanded workshops that teach students about consent and how to intervene if they see a friend in a vulnerable situation.“We really look at how can we promote these conversations and how can we work with our students to have these conversations,” she said.University of Connecticut saw sexual assault reports nearly double from 13 in 2012 to 25 last year, putting its rate for 2013 at 0.88 per 1,000 students.“I think the numbers will continue to rise here and at other campuses for years to come, and that’s really important because it gives us a better picture of what’s happening,” said UConn’s Title IX coordinator, Elizabeth Conklin.\nMeanwhile, Amherst College was one of just four schools in the survey that saw sexual assault reports decline. The college reported 14 sexual assaults in both 2010 and 2011, 17 offenses in 2012, and nine in 2013, which put its rate for 2013 at 5.04 per 1,000 students.Campus spokeswoman Caroline Hanna said in an e-mail that the college has taken numerous steps to better prevent and respond to sexual assault and encourages students to report the crime. But, “as these numbers tend to fluctuate across institutions and year over year, it is difficult for us to speculate about the reason for the change in last year’s numbers,” Hanna said.Under the Clery Act, colleges are required by Oct. 1 each year to issue a report that includes statistics of allegations of crimes that occurred on campus, including dorms and other public property; at property owned by, but separated from, the main campus; and at fraternities and sororities. They exclude other off-campus housing.An estimated 88 percent of college victims do not formally report sexual assaults, federal studies suggest. Even so, some area schools have reported surprisingly low numbers of assault allegations, given their size.Suffolk University, which enrolled 8,800 students last year, said there were no reports of sexual assaults in 2013. Since 2008, the downtown university reported two cases, both in 2010.School spokesman Greg Gatlin said the low numbers may be because fewer than 15 percent of Suffolk students live on campus.The university “works closely with students, faculty, and staff to encourage the reporting of any incident and to make our community aware of available resources,” he said in an e-mail.\nBunker Hill Community College, with an enrollment of about 14,000, listed one report of sexual assault in both 2008 and 2012, and zero reports in the four years in between.Spokeswoman Karen Norton said the college is confident its data is accurate. “We have a lot of processes in place about how we gather the information and report it,” Norton said.The two-year school is different from more traditional colleges, she said: There are no dormitories; two-thirds of the students are part time; and about one-third take at least some of their classes online. The average age of students is 27, she said.Without singling out specific schools, the Clery Center’s Kiss and other experts say that low numbers may indicate colleges are not doing enough to raise awareness about the issue or to educate how victims can report. It may also mean colleges are not being honest or thorough in their reporting, experts said.In recent years, numerous colleges have been caught or accused of failing to disclose individual reports of sexual assault or for releasing inaccurate data.Under new federal guidelines, colleges were required for the first time in 2013 to also compile and disclose the number of reports of dating violence, domestic violence, and stalking on their campuses. But two local schools failed to include those statistics on their latest Clery reports.One school was Roxbury Community College, which acknowledged last year — amid an ongoing federal investigation — that it had underreported crime figures in prior Clery reports. Campus president Valerie Roberson said in an e-mail that the college had no reports of domestic violence, dating violence, or stalking for 2013.“As a commuter college, these crimes would be unusual, especially when compared to what might occur at a residential college,” she wrote.Wentworth Institute of Technology also failed to include the newly required data.After the Globe pointed out the omission, Wentworth spokesman Caleb Cochran said it was an oversight. On Thursday, the school issued an updated report saying it did not receive reports in any of the three categories last year.\n\n

The purpose is to better understand how these pathogens might evolve in nature and work on measures to contain them.Scientists are sharply divided on whether such work is worth the risk that the genetically engineered virus could escape. In July, hundreds of them formed the Cambridge Working Group to argue against such research. Soon after, hundreds of others scientists who believe such work is essential formed Scientists for Science.Will BU engage in such research? “We do not plan on making pathogens more dangerous,” Corley said. “I cannot go on record that we will never do work that is similar, but our goal is never to make a pathogen more virulent or more dangerous.”Each project the lab wants to undertake must first win approval, in a public review process, from BU’s Institutional Biosafety Committee and the Boston Public Health Commission, which gets advice from an 18-member committee composed primarily of scientists knowledgeable about biosafety.But first, the health commission has to decide whether to allow the lab to open. It has held eight meetings on the issue and expects to make a decision this fall.If the biolab wins approval, Ebola and its cousin, Marburg, will be the first microbes studied. A BU microbiologist, Elke Mühlberger, plans to examine how Ebola undermines the immune system when it first invades cells.The BU biolab would be the 11th Level 4 lab in the country, but only the second at a university academic medical center. The academic setting, Corley said, brings together people from diverse fields, potentially sending research in surprising and fruitful directions.A new human pathogen arises every 18 months, and no one knows “what nature is going to throw at us” in the coming years, Corley said. “Two or three years from now, there will be pathogens that you or I have never heard of that we’ll be studying.”\n\n
\n People’s Climate March in New York City was a remarkable show of force on many levels. It was notable for its sheer size, some 300,000 demonstrators. Also impressive, though, was the diversity of its participants, in terms not only of race but also of age, religion, and even economic status. Policy makers in the United States and elsewhere won’t take stronger action against climate change without strong public demand. The New York City demonstration highlighted where the political will must come from: the grass roots.As the United Nations’ climate change summit convened last month,  that government leaders have met numerous times to address climate change threats with little to no result. “Relying on national governments alone to deliver results is not enough, as the last two decades have shown,” he writes. Despite commitments from countries to reduce global carbon dioxide emissions, . The dire consequences are coming into view; a UN environmental panel found that global warming has brought “a higher risk of flooding and changes to crop yields and water availability.” Still, no action at the top.\n\n\n\t\nThe march served as a platform to showcase the high level of climate activism brimming in local communities. From Massachusetts, hundreds of activists from nonprofits like Neighbor to Neighbor, Clean Water Action, and Fossil Free Somerville, among many others, attended Sunday’s march. From Boston alone, there were at least 22 full buses traveling to Manhattan in an effort put together by community groups like the Better Future Project/350MA and the Roxbury Environmental Empowerment Project, which actually chartered six buses full of minority youth activists to the rally. The presence of all these groups underscored the breadth of concern that exists about climate change. China, the US, and India are the world’s largest carbon polluters. But the two Asian countries were noticeably absent from the UN’s summit.  that his country’s carbon dioxide emissions would likely keep rising for the next 30 years. To sidestep the deadlock and bring these two nations to the proverbial table, the answer may very well be to focus on the growing sentiment across the planet to take more concrete actions to reduce global warming. 
Surprise, satisfaction, and a sense of ever-growing momentum.Massachusetts supporters of same-sex marriage shared those reactions Monday after the US Supreme Court opened the door for 11 more states to follow the Bay State’s lead, set in 2003, and allow gay couples to wed. \n\t\nThe high court’s decision immediately cleared the way for same-sex marriage in five states to bring the national total to 24 states plus the District of Columbia. Six others are expected to join the list in the near future.“This is a real watershed moment. The order means that equality of marriage will soon be lawful in 30 states and counting,” said Carol Rose, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts. “I couldn’t be happier. This is really great news.”The Supreme Court decided to let stand rulings from three US appellate courts that had overturned five state bans on same-sex marriage. Although the high court’s decision is  viewed by some as no decision, the practical result will be a dramatic increase in the number of states where gay and lesbians can marry.The decision also means that couples from those states who married in Massachusetts will now have their weddings recognized, and the unions of Massachusetts couples will be recognized more widely across the country.“It was unexpected for me and really exciting,” said Hillary Goodridge of Roslindale, a lead plaintiff in the landmark 2003 decision by the state Supreme Judicial Court. “All afternoon I’ve been singing the Alison Krauss song, ‘You say it best when you say nothing at all.’ ”To Goodridge, that silence by the US Supreme Court -- whose decision was issued without explanation -- is a thundering indication that same-sex marriage will inevitably become the law of the land.“I can’t imagine how it could be otherwise,” Goodridge said. “We still have, of course, a long way to go on a number of issues around civil rights and economic justice in this country, but certainly this has been a remarkable transformation of people’s vision.”The appellate rulings on same-sex marriage had been stayed before the Supreme Court’s decision, which now means that Virginia, Indiana, Oklahoma, Utah, and Wisconsin can allow gay couples to wed.The other six states -- Colorado, Kansas, North Carolina, South Carolina, West Virginia, and Wyoming -- are within the jurisdiction of those circuit courts. Because of the Supreme Court ruling, lawsuits filed in those states to allow same-sex marriage will be expected to win judicial approval.Although lauded by gay-rights activists, the high court’s action draw sharp criticism from opponents of same-sex marriage. The legal milestones that began 11 years ago in Massachusetts, they said, have emboldened federal courts to “silence the elected representatives of the people, and the people themselves,” said Andrew Beckwith, president of the Massachusetts Family Institute.\n“The Supreme Court decision to not take up these rulings on the question of marriage continues to allow courts, even individual judges, to undermine natural marriage and the rule of law,” Beckwith said.C.J. Doyle, executive director of the Catholic League of Massachusetts, echoed that view.“This means that the ability of the unelected branch of government to reverse public and legislative majorities will go unimpeded in this case,” Doyle said.However, Beckwith found some good news in the high court’s decision not to rule on the question of same-sex marriage. “The court’s decision ensures that the debate over natural marriage will continue, and we believe that time is not on the side of those who want to redefine natural marriage,” Beckwith said.But to Mary Bonauto, the attorney who represented Goodridge before the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, the tide has turned and is irreversible.“There’s a message coming out of these denials of reviews, and I expect that message to be heard by many other courts where cases are pending,” said Bonauto, civil rights project director for Gay & Lesbian Advocates & Defenders, based in Boston.Bonauto said she is not disappointed that the high court sidestepped the central question of whether gay marriage should be legal nationwide. “The bottom line is that this brings marriage to five states and six more in the circuits,” Bonauto said.“Thirty is not 50, and clearly there are other places to address,” Bonauto said. However, she added, “it’s certainly great to see it moving this quickly.”Rose, the ACLU director, agreed that the signals from the high court are favorable for even more expansion of same-sex marriage.“I think they may be acknowledging it’s coming and ... that the ride toward equal justice is unstoppable,” Rose said.Some supporters of gay marriage criticized the court for halting short of a landmark ruling. One of those, Arline Isaacson, said she had mixed reactions about the decision.“The first is a negative one, a frustration that the Supreme Court didn’t or wouldn’t make a decision on the issue once and for all when they know full well that this issue isn’t going away and is continuing to trend in our direction,” said Isaacson, co-chairwoman of the Massachusetts Gay and Lesbian Political Caucus.\n“But my second reaction was ... that the result of their delay, the result of their refusal to decide, does in fact help us with marriage equality.”
\nthe fall of 2002. I was about to participate in the interrogation of a top-level member of Al Qaeda. At my CIA briefing, I was told “to do whatever was necessary” to get the man to talk, as he could very well lead us to Osama Bin Laden himself.I immediately went to see one of the CIA’s lawyers for I feared I knew what was meant by “whatever was necessary.” The lawyer’s guidance was clear: The administration redefined torture to mean only “serious physical injury, such as organ failure, impairment of bodily function, or even death.” I was stunned. This undermined 800 years of Western law, from the Magna Carta to the Geneva Conventions.\n\t\nNone of us dared refer to what was going on as “torture.” The program became known, in our era’s infamous contribution to doublespeak, as “enhanced interrogation.” But there can be no mistaking it: So-called enhanced interrogation amounts to torture, plain and simple.The question of whether American practices amounted to torture is largely settled in the affirmative, despite a few vocal deniers in the desperate throes of self-justification. The question still being debated today is a different one: Is torture ever justified? Unfortunately, many seem to think so.A favorite thought experiment for torture proponents is the hoary “ticking time bomb” scenario: Wouldn’t — and shouldn’t — a president use torture if he thinks a detainee has information that could stop the mushroom cloud from going up in 30 minutes, and thereby save countless lives? Wouldn’t protecting thousands justify torture? Some, , favor  claiming that a democracy would be strengthened by making torture “visible and accountable,” instead of keeping it illegal.But such arguments are misleading. To accept this reasoning, one must be fooled by the faulty premise of the “ticking time bomb” scenario and accept that torture works in the first place. A further leap in logic would deem that the supposed benefits of carving out an exception for torture would outweigh the immorality of the practice as well as the harm to US and international laws, including our constitutional prohibition on “cruel and unusual” punishment. The “ticking time bomb” scenario rests on the flawed assumption that, somehow, torture would provide desperately needed information not otherwise obtainable in enough time to stop the threat. But when people are tortured, they will say anything to try to stop the pain. This is common knowledge. When John McCain was tortured as a prisoner of war in Vietnam, he famously listed the starting offensive lineup of the Green Bay Packers when water-boarded for the names of his squadron.In part because those being tortured are hostile parties and answering under duress, any information gained from them must be independently corroborated by a reliable source. This is one of the basic principles of the trade. Of course, if such a source existed, there would be no reason to use torture in the first place.The beloved “ticking time bomb” scenario has nothing to do with reality. The law ought to cover 99.999 percent of all plausible eventualities and affirm our principles. The law should not be tailored to cover a theoretical — erroneously imagined — scenario that has virtually no chance of happening.I had direct experience in every aspect of interrogation and intelligence in the so-called “war on terror.” From producing intelligence through interrogation to assessing it to seeing policies made from it, I was there. Let me be clear about what I learned: Torture undermines all sound principles of good interrogation, intelligence collection, and assessment. It does not work, it is unnecessary, it is illegal, it betrays our ideals and our nation’s laws. There is no practical, legal, moral, or utilitarian argument in favor of torture. We don’t need it, and it betrays who we seek to be. No fine-tuning of the law is necessary to justify it — ever. Americans like to imagine that history progresses, and that as a society, little by little, we become more enlightened, more knowledgeable, and better. In reality, sadly, our failings and our gifts as humans remain more or less constant, and we can regress easily without knowing it. After World War II, in the Japanese War Crimes Trials, the United States tried, convicted, and severely punished numerous Japanese soldiers for the express crime — the torture — of waterboarding. (The United States didn’t call it “enhanced interrogation” back then.) Surely my father’s generation, confronted with the gravest threat the nation has ever known, were tempted to cut legal and ethical corners, to use whatever measures might help safeguard the nation. But they also saw clearly that torture was not an option. Our nation affirmed what we had been fighting for, and who we wished to be, by making torture unconditionally illegal in the Geneva Conventions in 1949.After my involvement in the enhanced interrogation program, I concluded that public knowledge of these policies and acts is the only way to strengthen our democracy. That is why I wrote a book on my experiences — to show how easily we erred and how needlessly we traduced our values. And that is why I advocate release of the Senate Intelligence Committee’s report on the CIA enhanced interrogation program — so that we may have a public reckoning with what we did and, as a nation, commit never to make those errors again.The CIA hires officers who might succeed in the midst of ambiguity — the murk of uncertainty, pressure, and the obligation to act now — but can also affirm the principles we are sworn to serve. For me — a former CIA officer who spent decades trying to reconcile the irreconcilable, who lived with the impossible task of getting it right every time when all choices were fraught with ill consequence — one truth stood out in its simple clarity: Torture is wrong. No hypothetical can gainsay that, and no circumstance can justify making an exception.\n\n• \n
AS SUMMER wound down, I e-mailed my closest childhood friend, a distinguished Swedish doctor named Christian Sundberg, to inform him I’d soon be visiting his hometown. He responded that he was “in Sierra Leone at a pediatric emergency hospital in the middle of the biggest Ebola outbreak in recorded history.” The health care systems in West Africa, the epicenter of the current Ebola crisis, have been crippled by the outbreak. Aid workers like Christian risk their lives every day trying to treat the sick and comfort the dying. Many medical professionals — approximately 375 as of Sept. 23 — have contracted the disease themselves. More than 200 have died. \n\n\t\nThe best way we can honor these fearless men and women’s actions is to commit the United States permanently to Africa. As my friend writes, Ebola is “an attack of bioterrorism where the terrorist is Mother Nature.” The United States saw this week that it’s also a disease that can transcend borders. It deserves the same committed fight that America brings to human terrorism.  The continent’s health risks are made worse by the fact that so much of its most impoverished now live in urban areas. Urbanization is the route that leads out of poverty and misgovernment. Yet it is a route filled with risks. Viruses, like goods and ideas, move readily across dense city streets. The cities of the West were also once killing fields. Life expectancy for boys in New York City trailed the national average by seven years in 1901. Today, somewhat miraculously, life expectancies in New York are more than two years greater than the national average. To transform cities from places of contagious death into places of vibrant life, they need infrastructure, human capital, and effective government. President Obama has pledged 3,000 medical workers and up to $750 million in aid to the continent to help in the Ebola fight. But we also need to make long-term investments in less obvious areas like better health education, improved hospitals, and strong democracies — all of which may curb the risk of the next epidemic. \n grew up in the same building in Manhattan in the 1970s, where his father — an overwhelmingly decent man — was the Swedish representative to the UN Security Council. While his mother’s family had resources, Christian’s disdain for material possessions was almost as great as his emphatic bravery. As a 10-year-old, he regularly misplaced his keys, giving him an excuse for entering his 23d floor apartment by jumping James Bond-style from the building’s roof onto the balcony below. That courage was surely tested when his father left New York in 1978 to present his sword as ambassador to the Shah of Iran. When the Islamic revolution followed, Christian had tanks rolling into his living room. Christian escaped Tehran and eventually earned a PhD and a medical degree in Sweden. He came to Boston for a postdoctoral position in cancer research. He has won fancy awards for his research, but he gradually focused more on clinical medicine and started working for Medicins Sans Frontieres, or Doctors without Borders. He now treats patients suffering severe malnutrition at a MSF hospital in Sierra Leone’s Bo district called Gondama Health Clinic, which he and his colleagues are trying their best to keep open in a collapsing health care system that was already stretched before the current Ebola outbreak. He can explain why he does this work better than I can: “It is heartbreaking to see these children who when you first encounter them, you think, ‘How can they be alive?” On the flip side, there are few things as rewarding as assisting these children and seeing how many of them recover in your care.”",

The study failed to take into account the efforts that police have made on a number of fronts, including helping troubled young people stay in school, he said.“Shame, shame on the ACLU,” Scott said.\nIn its analysis, the ACLU slammed police for what it called “racially discriminatory policing,” and said that officers have failed to ensure that police-civilian encounters comply with constitutional protections against unreasonable searches and seizures. In about 75 percent of the recorded FIOs, officers simply wrote “Investigate person” under their reason for the encounter.“This report isn’t about questioning the good faith efforts of police officers to try to reduce violence in the city and to reduce crime in the city,” Segal said. “This was about testing whether those efforts, efforts directed at crime and violence and gangs, account for all these police encounters. And they just don’t.”The ACLU suggested the department require officers to wear body cameras and provide documentation to civilians involved in FIOs, and to publish data on all stops every quarter. Evans said the department will begin reporting data, and he is considering using business cards as receipts, and also will examine using body cameras.   Evans also noted, however, that since 2008, the department has decreased the number of FIOs it completes by nearly 42 percent, and has decreased arrests by 33 percent. That decline was accompanied by steady reductions in violent crime, he said. The commissioner also noted the study showed that 5 percent of the individuals subject to FIO accounted for more than 40 percent of the total FIOs conducted, meaning a number of people were involved in multiple encounters.An outside expert will review the final study, he said. Former Commissioner Davis, who commissioned the study, said that while it raises valid points, “I think it’s an overreaction to say that this is all racially charged and racially motivated.”Boston Mayor Martin J. Walsh said in a statement that while the report covers a period before his administration, the city has acknowledged and worked to address the racial disparities outlined by the ACLU. 
Passengers arriving at Logan International Airport will not be subject to Ebola screenings, airport and state health officials said Wednesday, but Logan will continue to rely on infectious disease protocols that flag passengers entering the United States who appear ill.Earlier Wednesday, federal officials had announced that Ebola screenings would begin at five major US airports, including taking the temperatures of people traveling from Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea.\n\t\nAnita Barry, director of the infectious disease bureau at the Boston Public Health Commission, said she was not concerned that Logan was not selected to enforce additional screening measures.“You can take everybody’s temperature in this airport .\xa0.\xa0. and you wouldn’t pick up some of the cases that may actually have Ebola,” Barry said.In a press conference at the airport, the Massachusetts Port Authority’s fire and rescue chief, Robert Donahue, said Logan will continue with current protocols for dealing with international travelers who appear to be ill. That includes partnering with local emergency responders and using an isolation room, if necessary.Officials noted that Logan does not have any nonstop flights to or from West Africa, but the airport hosts a number of international and domestic flights with connections to flights from Africa.In August, about 576,000 international passengers flew through Logan.“We’re very cognizant of the fact that we serve an international population and that really anything can be on our doorstep within 24 hours,” Barry said.Officials said they have done outreach work in many Massachusetts communities with West African immigrants, letting them know when they should report symptoms, she said. Barry said that because of Ebola’s 21-day incubation period, she is more concerned about travelers who could develop symptoms after they have left the airport.People need to know that they are unlikely to catch Ebola from someone sitting next to them on an airplane or on the subway, Barry said. “Education is the answer here,” she added.Nonetheless, some travelers passing through Logan on Wednesday said they wished that officials were taking more visible steps at the airport to combat Ebola’s potential spread.Allen Wellington, 37, of Hopkinton, who had just touched down after a business trip to Switzerland, said he was surprised there were not more protocols related to Ebola in place.“They need to do things more proactively,” Wellington said. “They need to be more vigilant looking for symptoms.”Ian Darke, who arrived from London Heathrow Airport on Wednesday afternoon, said more intensive screenings would help put minds at ease.“I don’t think anything is an overreaction,” said Darke, of London.But not all international passengers agreed.Barbara Cassani, who returned to Boston after a trip to Lisbon, said she was not sure there was much more the United States could be doing.When Mohammed Modupe, 59, left Nigeria, where a small number of Ebola cases were reported this summer, airport officials took her temperature and asked her questions about where else she had traveled. She flew through Heathrow for a connecting flight to Boston, without more questioning related to Ebola.Modupe, who lives in Allston, said that she believed the screenings in Nigeria were necessary and would not be out of the question in the United States at international airports like Logan.“It doesn’t take much to at least ask some questions and fill out more forms,” she said.\n
Governor Deval Patrick, who was battered early in his political career by accusations that he would be soft on crime, said Thursday that as he enters his final months in office he is prepared to grant the first pardons of his tenure.He is considering the cases of three men who have all been out of prison 15 to 25 years and have had clean records for decades, according to records filed with the Advisory Board of Pardons. Two of the three have drug records, and one was convicted of assault.\n\t\n“I’m ready, and I think the Governor’s Council, which has to approve them, is ready, within bounds,” Patrick said during his monthly appearance on WGBH-FM, Boston Public Radio.A state advisory board has asked him to pardon the men, which effectively would expunge their records.If any of the pardons are granted, they would be the first since 2002, when acting Governor Jane Swift pardoned seven people whose records included offenses such as marijuana possession, drug dealing, check forgery, and driving with a suspended license. Her successor, Republican Governor Mitt Romney, issued no pardons or commutations (a separate action that allows early release from prison), a fact he proclaimed proudly as he sought the Republican presidential nomination in 2008.For Patrick, who swept into office in 2007 as a liberal Democrat and a former staff lawyer of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, the pardons would come when there is less risk of political blowback, say political analysts.Patrick is leaving office in January and has said he will enter the private sector.“It would almost seem cruel and insensitive for a governor to go through an entire term and never reconsider decisions that may have in the long run appeared to be unjust and overly harsh,” said Jeffrey M. Berry, professor of political science at Tufts University. “These sound like very safe pardons and ones that are unlikely to create any kind of controversy. These are not bold steps designed to make a judgment on the judicial system.”During the 2006 governor’s race, Patrick was attacked by his Republican opponent, Kerry Healey, for writing letters to the Parole Board seeking the release of Benjamin LaGuer, a convicted rapist serving a life sentence. He was not released.Healey ran a hard-hitting television ad highlighting a case Patrick won as a Legal Defense Fund lawyer in 1985, when he successfully halted the execution of Carl Ray Songer, who was convicted of murdering a Florida state trooper. That case had provoked an outcry in Florida and anger from the trooper’s family.But among advocates for prisoners’ rights and critics of mandatory sentences for drug offenses, there was hope that Patrick’s tenure would usher in more pardons and commutations.During his first year in office, the Advisory Board of Appeals received 131 petitions for commutations and pardons. That was more than twice as many as the board received in 2006, during Romney’s last year in office.\n\nIn the ensuing years, the Advisory Board gave the governor one recommendation for a commutation and none for pardons. He rejected the commutation.In his interview Thursday with WGBH, Patrick said that he once considered granting pardons to an entire class of convicts serving time for nonviolent drug offenses but found it was too difficult to pinpoint them since they were tangled up in other, more serious legal issues.By 2013, the number of petitions filed with the board fell to 48. People simply stopped expecting that Patrick would grant a pardon, said Representative Russell Holmes, a Mattapan Democrat.“I haven’t even gotten a request from a constituent on behalf of a family member to be pardoned,” he said. “You go through almost three terms .\xa0.\xa0. and it’s not happening. You move on to other things.”If Patrick agrees to pardon the men, his recommendations will go to the Governor’s Council, which will vote on whether to approve them.Jeffrey Snyder, a 43-year-old cancer survivor living in Sheffield with his wife and teenage daughter, served two years in the Berkshire House of Correction after he was arrested for selling a small bag of marijuana when he was a 17-year-old high school senior. The Advisory Board described the sentence as “very harsh.”After his release, Snyder was never arrested again, but his record has kept him from pursuing his dream job as a high school sports coach.“I’d like to vote,” Snyder said during his hearing for a pardon. “I’ve never had the opportunity to vote.”Edem Seth Amet, a 39-year-old Liberian man, was convicted of selling crack cocaine in 1995 to a confidential police informant. His record means he is ineligible to become a US citizen, and though he can work in the country legally, he harbors fears of deportation.True-See Allah, 44, is the only person seeking a pardon for a violent offense. Allah, now a Suffolk County Sheriff’s Office employee who helps inmates make the transition from jail to freedom, was convicted in 1991 of armed assault with intent to murder for his role in the shooting of a man he thought was a gang rival. The victim was left paralyzed.After Allah was released in 1998, he devoted himself to steering drug addicts and criminals on Boston streets to the Nation of Islam. His work was so effective, he quickly drew the respect of city leaders, police, and prosecutors. Suffolk District Attorney Daniel F. Conley, whose office prosecuted Allah before Conley’s tenure, even wrote a letter supporting his pardon.It is unclear if any pardons are imminent. Patrick declined to comment beyond his statements on the radio. The board is also holding hearings for inmates seeking early release, but has not made any recommendations to Patrick.Earlier this year, Patrick changed the guidelines for commutations and pardon petitions to make it easier for convicts to be eligible. Before, a petitioner’s record had to be clean for 15 years in felony cases and 10 years in misdemeanor cases to be eligible. That time was reduced to 10 years for felonies and five years for misdemeanors.
\n\n\n of Uniontown, Ohio, is the mother of an adorable 2-year-old girl named Payton, whom she and her partner call a “dream come true” and love with all their heart. “She’s made us the people that we are,” Cramblett says. “Never trade it for the world.”If that’s the case, Payton will doubtless wonder, once she’s old enough to Google her own name, why did Cramblett  that enabled her to get pregnant with her wonderful daughter? Why did she demand tens of thousands of dollars as compensation for breach of warranty and for what the lawsuit calls Payton’s “wrongful birth?” \n\t\nThe answer, Cramblett and her lawyers  in televised interviews, has nothing to do with Payton, and everything to do with punishing the sperm bank for a careless mix-up: It supplied vials of sperm from Donor No. 330, when Cramblett had selected Donor No. 380. When Cramblett tried to untangle the matter with the sperm bank, she says, the receptionist was rude and hung up on her. “I am happy that I have a healthy child,” Cramblett . “But I’m not going to let them get away with not being held accountable.” But Cramblett’s suit against Midwest Sperm Bank hasn’t become a cause célèbre because of a customer service issue. It ignited a furor because of race. Cramblett was inseminated with the sperm of a black man, instead of the blonde-haired, blue-eyed white man she and her partner had picked from the sperm bank’s catalogue of donors. Which means that Payton is biracial — or to use Cramblett’s phrase, “obviously mixed race.” Hence the lawsuit, and the demand for at least $50,000 in damages. After all, the Ohio couple wasn’t expecting to have to raise a child with skin darker than theirs.Did somebody say racist? No, no, no, Cramblett insists, this isn’t about race at all. “For people to think I don’t want this child because of her skin tone is just not the case,” . And when Payton is older, she’ll understand that “the lawsuit was about a company that had to make changes and give us compensation so that we can go through counseling and learn how to love each other even more.”Sure she will. Because parents who adore their children as a “dream come true” and wouldn’t trade them “for the world” always file wrongful-birth lawsuits. Don’t they?It’s hard to decide which is more surreal — the race-obsessed complaint Cramblett , or her after-the-fact pretense that she isn’t making an issue of her daughter’s race. Cramblett wants to be paid handsomely for the “personal injuries, medical expense, pain, suffering, emotional distress, and other economic and non-economic losses” caused by Payton’s birth. Those hardships include having white relatives who can be “unconsciously insensitive,” and Cramblett’s “anxiety” at the prospect of enrolling her daughter in an all-white school. Uniontown — the Akron suburb to which Cramblett relocated with her partner for its good schools — she now regards as “too racially intolerant.” That’s not all that Cramblett has found “stressful” about motherhood. “Payton has hair typical of an African American girl,” the lawsuit notes. “To get a decent cut, Jennifer must travel to a black neighborhood, far from where she lives, where she is obviously different in appearance, and not overtly welcome.” Well. If that doesn’t merit a wrongful-birth lawsuit, what does?Poor Payton. One day she’ll read the court documents in this case and realize that her mother saw racism everywhere she looked, when the only person flipping out about giving birth to a biracial daughter was Payton’s mother herself. When the sperm bank receptionist asked Cramblett whether she had selected an African-American donor, the Ohio woman snapped: “No, why would I request that? My partner and I are Caucasian.” When she learned that her sperm donor wasn’t white after all, she admits, she was filled with “anger, disappointment, and fear.”Midwest Sperm Bank acknowledges its blunder, and it ought to face some legal repercussion for its sloppy record-keeping. But Cramblett could have gotten pregnant by Donor No. 380 and still ended up with a daughter very different from what she expected. Payton could have been born with Down syndrome or deafness; she could have had cystic fibrosis or a congenital heart defect. Then whom would her mother be targeting in a lawsuit? Having a baby isn’t like ordering a pair of jeans — . Anyone who thinks they are entitled to exactly the child they envisioned — and are prepared to fly to court if they don’t get it — isn’t fit to be a parent. The world is full of people whose conception was in some way unplanned or unexpected. That doesn’t make their births wrongful or a reason to play the race card. For Payton’s sake, let’s hope her mother figures that out, and soon.
Boston needs to build 53,000 housing units by 2030 to keep pace with rapid population growth that is already increasing prices and squeezing out low- and middle-income residents, according to a city report.The report by Mayor Martin J. Walsh’s administration, previewed by city officials on Wednesday, calls for  $21 billion in private and public construction that would increase Boston’s overall housing stock by 20 percent over the next two decades. \n\t\nDuring that period, the city’s population is expected to jump by 15 percent, to 709,000 people, according to the report. That would be Boston’s highest level since the 1950s, when large numbers of people began to leave the city for surrounding suburbs.\n\n Walsh wants to limit further real estate price inflation by creating 20,000 units for middle-income residents, largely built by private developers. His plan would loosen zoning restrictions and provide financial incentives to encourage construction of taller buildings in outlying neighborhoods. It would offer developers tax incentives and other assistance to help reach that goal. He also wants to increase annual city funding for low-income housing by 65 percent, to $51 million, and require developers of downtown luxury complexes to pay more and build affordable units at other locations.“This plan will allow people to buy homes and stay in their neighborhoods,” Walsh said, adding that he would seek to concentrate development around MBTA stations. “The quicker we create housing, the faster we stabilize the market.” The 131-page report is the mayor’s first comprehensive attempt to address one of Boston’s most vexing problems — a widening income divide undermining economic diversity and pushing families out of neighborhoods where they have lived for generations. Some of the proposals are similar to a smaller scale plan advanced by Thomas M. Menino, the former mayor, late in his administration.In a press conference Wednesday, Walsh spoke about the issue in personal terms, describing the plight of a family forced to leave their home in the mayor’s own Dorchester neighborhood.“They got a letter that they’re being evicted because somebody bought their house,” he said. “You can’t blame the new owner for wanting to condo-ize the building, but we’re losing the stability of having that family there. They raised four kids there and where do they go? That’s why we’re doing this plan.”  Rising rents and home prices are affecting neighborhoods across the city. During the past year, for example, a middle-income household earning $80,000 a year could only afford 1.7 percent of homes on the market in Downtown Boston. That family could afford only 4.7 percent of homes in South Boston, a traditionally working class enclave.The number of people living in the city with earnings at or below median income levels is expected to increase in coming years, with senior citizens making up a large part of the demand. According to the report, an additional 14,600 units will be needed for people over 65 earning less than $50,000 a year, a 52 percent increase from 2010.   Prices have risen so much in some neighborhoods near downtown that Walsh and his aides concluded that building low- and middle-income housing there is no longer possible. Instead, they hope to spur construction in neighborhoods such as East Boston, Allston-Brighton, Dorchester, and Roxbury, where land is cheaper and more plentiful.\n\nPart of the plan also includes construction of 16,000 units of student housing on campus by 2030, cutting by 50 percent the number of students living in private homes and freeing up that space for working individuals or families. The mayor said he would be receptive to private development proposals creating more housing for students by building student villages and other large complexes. To produce more middle-income housing, the report proposes construction of large-scale housing complexes near MBTA \n stations, where developers could trim costs by building fewer parking spaces for residents. The city is also considering zoning incentives that would allow developers to construct taller buildings in select areas. Multiyear property tax breaks could also be added to make projects more profitable.“We all know there is demand” for middle-income housing, Walsh said. “If we can create a market in these different areas, then people are going to come and build.”Without financial incentive,  the mayor’s report concludes, developers will continue to focus on building luxury complexes that command the highest rents and offer the best returns. More than 8,000 new apartments are expected to be completed in Boston during the next three years, but the vast majority are expected to rent for $3,500 a month or more.Housing specialists said city officials must move swiftly to streamline building regulations and allow developers to take advantage of Boston’s thriving economy.  “We have to do this right and we have to do it big,” said Richard Taylor, director of the Center for Real Estate at Suffolk University. “Boston is a highly sought-after market by developers, but the complaints are that land is too expensive and the process is too complicated. Those are the areas we need to chip away at.”The report proposes to help speed the city’s development review process, particularly for  builders proposing new housing on small, privately owned parcels. That could help spur production in densely-packed areas, where building proposals often face long delays.Some of the region’s largest housing builders are already increasing their investments in Boston. The city gained about 28,000 new residents between 2000 and 2010, then added the same amount over the following three years to bring the city’s population to 646,000.“There is movement by a lot of people into great 24-hour cities, and Boston is certainly one of those,” said Michael Roberts, senior vice president for AvalonBay Communities Inc. Historically, the company has focused its investment in suburban areas, but it is now building more than 1,100 apartments in Boston.While those units are targeted to wealthier renters, Roberts said the company “would be very  interested in finding a way to make middle-income housing work.”“The capital is there and the interest in that market is there,” he said. “Having a clear program to get us there is the key.”\n\n
One night last August, after some tough newspaper stories about the Boston Police Department’s failure to solve homicides in the black community, a once-unlikely “beer summit” was convened. Police Commissioner William Evans, Superintendent-in-Chief Willie Gross, NAACP President Michael Curry, and Urban League President Darnell Williams met at Williams’ Roxbury house for an uncensored conversation on race, crime, and the BPD. \n\t\n“Quite frankly we discussed the implications of race and racism and how you do law enforcement,” Curry said Thursday. “It was a great beginning to a different type of relationship. We talked about diversity, and snitching, and building a new relationship that can manifest into real changes.”Curry wasn’t surprised this week that a newly-released analysis by the American Civil Liberties Union found police have been disproportionately observing, stopping, and frisking blacks and Latinos. But he wasn’t sure the findings, based on data collected between 2007 and 2010, reflect current reality. If the goal was to put the Boston Police Department on the defensive, the American Civil Liberties Union succeeded admirably in releasing its own analysis of the numbers.  Just its title — “Black, Brown, and Targeted” — is the stuff of which headlines and rallies are made. But as a snapshot of community-police relations, the analysis may be guilty of playing fast and loose with very sensitive facts.The statistics gathered by police indicate that for years blacks had a higher rate of police encounters than whites. Those encounters included being observed, stopped, interrogated, and frisked. An ACLU lawyer said the report “shows clear evidence not just of racial disparity, but of racial bias.” But Jeffrey Fagan of Columbia University Law School, one of two who did the research, said in a telephone interview that “we made it perfectly clear that we could not say one way or the other that there was bias.”Fagan, a nationally-known researcher who has closely studied stop-and-frisk policies in several cities — most notably New York, which has discontinued the practice under pressure — stressed that the study did find significant disparities in treatment. That was true even after accounting for such factors as the crime rate in certain neighborhoods, or gang affiliation.  But he pointedly refused to go as far as the ACLU in ascribing the disparities to sheer racism. “If you send all the cops to one neighborhood, you could just be maximizing what you’re trying to do,” Fagan said. “The data we have can’t speak to the question of bias. We can’t peer into the police officers’ souls.” It isn’t just an academic dispute, not in a city where the relationship between the police department and minority communities has historically been complicated. “Targeted” is a loaded term — and even the researchers aren’t sure it applies here.It doesn’t help that the data is now four years old. That’s long enough for the department to plausibly claim that it has made real strides in moving away from its problematic past. Gross — the second black officer to serve as second-in command in the department — insisted that the only people being targeted were known bad apples. “I’m an African-American chief,” he said. “Do you think I’m going to let racial bias go on under my watch and not address it?” The NAACP’s Curry suggested \ndebate over police practices is always healthy, regardless of disputes over nuances. “Whether you’re a teacher, a guidance counselor, or a police officer, you bring your prejudices to the job,” Curry said. “One of the most critical jobs to wipe out racial bias would be public safety, because it’s life and death.”He’s right about the importance of getting a handle on race and public safety. That’s exactly why an honest discussion about where we really are is so important. It shouldn’t be reduced to hype. \n\n• \n
\n\n\n Paul LePage, Maine’s pugnacious CEO, has frequently found himself in the headlines for bombastic, and sometimes crude, comments.But his most interesting remark in the first couple of gubernatorial debates seemed to carry an undertone of reflection and even regret. Offering a closing statement at a Chamber of Commerce forum on Wednesday, LePage brought up a super PAC ad that referred to his divisive governing style and controversial remarks and charged that he had embarrassed Maine.\n\t\n“You see all these ads, the governor is an embarrassment . . . he said this, he said that,” LePage began. “So I studied them last night. Guess what?”You expected one of two things: LePage would either declare that he’d say it all again or claim that he had been taken out of context.“Not one of those things, I said in the last two years,” he continued. “It was all said in the first two years. So even a Frenchman can be taught to cool down.”After the debate, a couple of us caught up with the press-averse governor as he hustled from the hall. Was his comment an acknowledgment that . . .LePage was ready before the question arrived at its obvious conclusion.“It’s an acknowledgment that I am French,” he said.Not just that, but Maine’s first governor of French descent, which makes him unusual. And yet, the man with the best shot at beating him this fall is more unusual still. That’s Second District US Representative Michael Michaud, the first person of French descent to serve Maine in a federal office. If he wins, the former paper-mill worker would also be the first openly gay candidate to be elected governor anywhere in the United States.Michaud came out last fall, near the start of his campaign, as a way to move beyond the whispering. It’s a credit to Maine that his sexual orientation really hasn’t been an issue beyond adding an unexpected dimension to a congenial meat-and-potatoes politician who after high school went to work rather than to college. Michaud, who hails from East Millinocket, about 65 miles north of Bangor, has been statistically tied with LePage in most of the recent polling.Still, though LePage is thought to have a hard ceiling in the high 30s or low 40s, he also has a path to victory. It’s the same one he traveled four years ago: a plurality win in a field where his two rivals divide the anti-LePage vote.The third candidate is independent Eliot Cutler, an owly, jowly, Harvard- and Georgetown Law-educated attorney who finished a close second in 2010, garnering 35.9 percent of the vote to LePage’s 37.6, with Democrat Libby Mitchell a distant third at 19 percent.This time, however, the one stuck in a distant third is Cutler, who conveys the sense of someone who believes his superiority as a would-be governor is so self-evident that it’s a little wearying to have to point it out. When I asked if he was shaping up as a spoiler in this year’s race, Cutler gestured at the stage where the three had just finished debating.“I’m spoiling this choice?” he said. “How could anyone spoil this choice?”There is far more on the line here than just personal style or intellectual or ethnic pride or identity politics, of course.LePage has repeatedly vetoed legislation to expand Medicaid health care coverage as allowed under the Affordable Care Act. The eldest of 18 children born to a poor Lewiston family headed by an alcoholic, abusive father, he came up the hard way, running away at 11 and relying on his own pluck and the kindness of strangers to survive. A Horatio Alger story, LePage, a Husson University graduate, sees a Medicaid expansion as more welfare rather than a big opportunity to increase health care in the state.Both Michaud and Cutler, by contrast, would expand Medicaid coverage.That issue, along with LePage’s temperamental style, is weighing heavily on voters’ minds. A number of Cutler fans told me they soon had to decide whether Michaud is the only one who can oust the irascible incumbent.Which is a message Michaud is working to reinforce. Talking to reporters after a Thursday debate at Thomas College in Waterville, the congressman didn’t take the bait when asked if he thought Cutler should drop out, but said that as election day nears, he thinks some Cutler voters will “jump ship” and support him.“They’re very nervous that they might have another four more years of this governor,” he said, pointedly.It’s hard for a candidate like Cutler to recognize that his moment has passed.But this state has a strong practical instinct and a palpable desire to turn the page.I’ll go out on a limb here. Mike Michaud is the next governor of Maine.
Boston city councilors on Thursday blasted Radius Specialty Hospital for shutting down its Roxbury and Quincy rehabilitation facilities, transferring its patients, and laying off nearly 350 workers with little notice.Radius workers found themselves out of jobs just about two weeks after the company publicly acknowledged on Sept. 23 that it would stop operating. At a City Council hearing on the shutdown, Radius’s lawyer said the company had no choice because it was rapidly running out of cash. But councilors did not buy the explanation.\n\t\n“This is a disgrace,” Councilor Ayanna Pressley told laid-off workers who attended the hearing. “This is no way to repay people who have been as committed and dedicated as you have been.”The criticisms from the City Council were just the latest of recent troubles for Radius. Steward Health Care, which was leasing space to Radius at the Steward-owned Quincy Medical Center, last week sued to collect more than $1 million it says Radius owes in back rent.In the lawsuit, Steward said Radius has not paid its full rent for more than a year. Radius disputes the claim.Two labor unions, the Massachusetts Nurses Association and Local 1199 of the Service Employees International Union, have also sued Radius, alleging the company failed to give proper notice before shutting its doors. Both unions had members who were laid off by Radius.Radius ran a 38-bed facility in Quincy and an 84-bed facility in Roxbury. The Quincy operations, though smaller than Roxbury’s, generated enough money to subsidize the struggling Roxbury site, according to Radius’s lawyer, Stewart F. Grossman.Grossman told city councilors that the events that forced the company to shut down were largely out of Radius’s control. He said the problems began Aug. 11 when South Shore Hospital in Weymouth stopped referring patients to the Quincy facility.Then, when Radius’s bank, Santander, learned of its struggles, the bank recalled Radius’s loans of $16 million and froze an account holding $2.4 million.City councilors said that in addition to Santander and South Shore Hospital, Partners HealthCare also shares the blame for Radius’s closing. Partners, which is seeking to acquire South Shore Hospital, operates its own rehabilitation facilities.Representatives from South Shore and Partners were invited to testify at the hearing but did not attend. Councilors said they would ask them to testify at a continued hearing next week. They said they would also ask Santander to testify.South Shore Hospital’s spokeswoman, Sarah Darcy, said the hospital never stopped referring patients to Radius. “Referrals are based on a patient’s medical need and preference,” she said in an e-mail. “Statements that allege that our referral patterns are influenced by our proposed merger are false. South Shore Hospital is not a part of Partners HealthCare.”Partners spokesman Rich Copp said this is “not a Partners HealthCare matter,” but “if the city council wants us to appear next week, we’ll be happy to appear.”Santander declined to comment on Radius, citing privacy rules, but said in a statement: “We are a responsible lender and endeavor to work with customers in the event they have difficulty meeting their obligations to the bank.”Radius’s sudden closing has thrown the lives of its former workers into disarray, the workers told city councilors.“The way everything happened was so abrupt,” said Agatha Layne, who worked as a nurse in Roxbury. “We didn’t have time to even think. What about all the workers who have children in college? What are we going to do?”Hillie Sampson, a cook, said he is struggling to find work after 37 years with Radius. “I’m playing catch-up,” he said. “It doesn’t make life easy for you, especially when you’re middle-aged and you have to go out and find a job, and you’re competing with all these young people.”Grossman apologized to the laid-off workers.“I really feel terrible for this situation,” he said. “My clients had every intention in the world to continue operating those hospitals.”
Baseball has a way of sewing the loose threads of history together and this October is no different. With the October spotlight cast upon the resurgent Kansas City Royals, who begin play in the American League Championship Series against the Baltimore Orioles on Friday, it’s also an opportunity to shine a light on another Kansas City, Mo., baseball revival. The Negro Leagues Baseball Museum was in dire straits with dwindling support and finances back in 2010, but under president Bob Kendrick, who took over in 2011, the museum has bounced back. It has had three straight profitable years and will celebrate its 25th anniversary next year, no small feat for a museum that at its inception was housed in one small office with former Negro Leagues players such as the legendary Buck O’Neil having to pay the rent. \n\t\nWhen the Patriots played the Kansas City Chiefs last month, I toured the 10,000-square-foot museum for three hours, learning about players familiar (Josh Gibson, Satchel Paige, and James “Cool Papa” Bell) and players unfamiliar (Moses Fleetwood Walker, Pittsfield’s own Frank Grant, and John Henry “Pop” Lloyd). It was both fascinating and infuriating to know such great talents had existed in a parallel universe to major league baseball history. It was heartening to see their stories preserved and disheartening to know that more major league teams and players weren’t contributing more to a national treasure of the national pastime.If half the attention was paid to the museum by big league players that was paid to Derek Jeter’s fond farewell tour, Kendrick’s task would be a lot easier. But it’s more fun to tweet out “Re2pect” and wear Jeter wristbands. Players, especially African-American and Latino ones, have to step up to the plate with financial support for the museum.“It’s all privately funded. It has been from Day 1,” said Kendrick. “You start looking at sports museums and Halls of Fame around the country, they’re all struggling. During that down period for us we were not an exception. We have done this on our own. We don’t have a major endowment. We don’t have a lot of big-name contributions. We have been in many ways, like those in the Negro Leagues, having to scratch and claw and find a way in order to create a stable environment. We now want to look at how we move this organization to the next 25 years.”Kendrick said there is a core group of players that has provided support. He said that Los Angeles Dodgers outfielder Matt Kemp has been very generous. Ichiro Suzuki contributed to the museum in honor of O’Neil. Jeter, CC Sabathia, Torii Hunter, Ryan Howard, Jimmy Rollins, and Curtis Granderson have all been involved. Kendrick said it’s actually easier to get the support of former players. Baseball Hall of Famers Ernie Banks, Joe Morgan, Lou Brock, and Dave Winfield are major contributors.The National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y., has 90 full-time employees. The Negro Leagues Baseball Museum has seven, according to Kendrick. The museum would like to hire more staff, but that takes money. Kendrick said it’s the museum’s job to connect current players with their Negro Leagues forebearers. He’s being magnanimous. It should be the job of the MLB Players Association to connect their membership’s resources to the museum. Raising funds and the museum’s profile became more difficult after O’Neil died on Oct. 6, 2006. O’Neil, a former Negro Leagues player, major league scout, and beloved baseball raconteur, was the museum’s patron saint and ambassador.The success of the Kansas City Royals, long among baseball’s downtrodden but back in the playoffs for the first time since Ronald Reagan was president and Madonna was blazing the charts, has been a boon for the museum. During the Royals’ push to make the playoffs for the first time since 1985, the museum, normally closed on Mondays, began opening seven days a week. Kendrick is hoping the national buzz from the ALCS will boost the museum’s profile.“There is no question that the Royals being in the playoffs has had a tremendous impact on our turnstiles,” said Kendrick. Under the Glass family’s stewardship, the Royals have frequently been cited as one of the more frugal clubs in baseball, but they’ve always been generous with their support for the Negro Leagues museum. Kendrick said that just this week, Royals pitcher Jeremy Guthrie brought guests to the museum.“The relationship with the Royals is really strong. They have been a great partner,” said Kendrick. “They have fully embraced what it represents and have an understanding and an appreciation of the roots of the league in this city, with the birth of the Negro Leagues here and the great Kansas City Monarchs teams. “The club has been a great voice in helping promote the museum. The Brewers, Padres, and Yankees have all been involved in supporting the museum financially for years. Our goal is to get all 30 clubs involved in supporting our museum.”(Kendrick said the Red Sox bring players every year, led by play-by-play announcer Joe Castiglione, whom Kendrick called a dear friend.)The museum doesn’t just want to be part of baseball’s past. Kendrick said the museum could play a role in addressing declining participation in baseball among African-Americans. Only 8.3 percent of big leaguers on 2014 Opening Day rosters were African American, \nIt was 125 years ago that Moses Fleetwood Walker, the first African-American to play in the major leagues and the last until Jackie Robinson, played in his final minor league game for the Syracuse Stars of the International League. A gentleman’s agreement pulled the curtain of segregation over major league baseball and its minor league affiliates until Robinson, a Kansas City Monarchs player, joined the Dodgers’ Triple A affiliate, the Montreal Royals, in 1946. No sport is more reverential with its history than baseball. Spotlighted by the Kansas City Royals’ renaissance, a piece of that history deserves baseball’s embrace. 
\n\n\n of Uniontown, Ohio, is the mother of an adorable 2-year-old girl named Payton, whom she and her partner call a “dream come true” and love with all their heart. “She’s made us the people that we are,” Cramblett says. “Never trade it for the world.”If that’s the case, Payton will doubtless wonder, once she’s old enough to Google her own name, why did Cramblett  that enabled her to get pregnant with her wonderful daughter? Why did she demand tens of thousands of dollars as compensation for breach of warranty and for what the lawsuit calls Payton’s “wrongful birth?” \n\t\nThe answer, Cramblett and her lawyers  in televised interviews, has nothing to do with Payton, and everything to do with punishing the sperm bank for a careless mix-up: It supplied vials of sperm from Donor No. 330, when Cramblett had selected Donor No. 380. When Cramblett tried to untangle the matter with the sperm bank, she says, the receptionist was rude and hung up on her. “I am happy that I have a healthy child,” Cramblett . “But I’m not going to let them get away with not being held accountable.” But Cramblett’s suit against Midwest Sperm Bank hasn’t become a cause célèbre because of a customer service issue. It ignited a furor because of race. Cramblett was inseminated with the sperm of a black man, instead of the blonde-haired, blue-eyed white man she and her partner had picked from the sperm bank’s catalogue of donors. Which means that Payton is biracial — or to use Cramblett’s phrase, “obviously mixed race.” Hence the lawsuit, and the demand for at least $50,000 in damages. After all, the Ohio couple wasn’t expecting to have to raise a child with skin darker than theirs.Did somebody say racist? No, no, no, Cramblett insists, this isn’t about race at all. “For people to think I don’t want this child because of her skin tone is just not the case,” . And when Payton is older, she’ll understand that “the lawsuit was about a company that had to make changes and give us compensation so that we can go through counseling and learn how to love each other even more.”Sure she will. Because parents who adore their children as a “dream come true” and wouldn’t trade them “for the world” always file wrongful-birth lawsuits. Don’t they?It’s hard to decide which is more surreal — the race-obsessed complaint Cramblett , or her after-the-fact pretense that she isn’t making an issue of her daughter’s race. Cramblett wants to be paid handsomely for the “personal injuries, medical expense, pain, suffering, emotional distress, and other economic and non-economic losses” caused by Payton’s birth. Those hardships include having white relatives who can be “unconsciously insensitive,” and Cramblett’s “anxiety” at the prospect of enrolling her daughter in an all-white school. Uniontown — the Akron suburb to which Cramblett relocated with her partner for its good schools — she now regards as “too racially intolerant.” That’s not all that Cramblett has found “stressful” about motherhood. “Payton has hair typical of an African American girl,” the lawsuit notes. “To get a decent cut, Jennifer must travel to a black neighborhood, far from where she lives, where she is obviously different in appearance, and not overtly welcome.” Well. If that doesn’t merit a wrongful-birth lawsuit, what does?Poor Payton. One day she’ll read the court documents in this case and realize that her mother saw racism everywhere she looked, when the only person flipping out about giving birth to a biracial daughter was Payton’s mother herself. When the sperm bank receptionist asked Cramblett whether she had selected an African-American donor, the Ohio woman snapped: “No, why would I request that? My partner and I are Caucasian.” When she learned that her sperm donor wasn’t white after all, she admits, she was filled with “anger, disappointment, and fear.”Midwest Sperm Bank acknowledges its blunder, and it ought to face some legal repercussion for its sloppy record-keeping. But Cramblett could have gotten pregnant by Donor No. 380 and still ended up with a daughter very different from what she expected. Payton could have been born with Down syndrome or deafness; she could have had cystic fibrosis or a congenital heart defect. Then whom would her mother be targeting in a lawsuit? Having a baby isn’t like ordering a pair of jeans — . Anyone who thinks they are entitled to exactly the child they envisioned — and are prepared to fly to court if they don’t get it — isn’t fit to be a parent. The world is full of people whose conception was in some way unplanned or unexpected. That doesn’t make their births wrongful or a reason to play the race card. For Payton’s sake, let’s hope her mother figures that out, and soon.
Just before midnight Thursday, Boston police started looking for the source of a gunshot that echoed along Bradlee Street in Dorchester. Their search ended in the basement of a home where five people were gathered around a pool table – and a .22-caliber pistol was found inside one of the pockets.According to police, officers responded to the neighborhood at 11:53 p.m. to investigate a single gunshot captured by the Shotspotter system. While searching the backyard of one house near where the gunshot detection system had pinpointed the source of the sound, police heard voices coming from the basement, prompting officers to go to the front door and ask for permission to search.\n\t\nAt the front door, the homeowner told police she was home alone. But officers, concerned for her safety, asked for and were given permission to search the home, said Boston police spokesman Sergeant Michael McCarthy.In the basement, police found the five people loosely gathered near a pool table. Police discovered a .22-caliber pistol stashed in one of the pockets, police said. Inside the gun, police found one spent round and one live round, McCarthy said.One man, 30-year-old Kevin Fulghan of Mattapan, was taken into custody when police learned there an active arrest warrant for him from Quincy District Court, McCarthy said. The four other people, including a 14-year-old boy, were released.No one was charged with possession of the gun, but the investigation is continuing.
A 90-year-old World War II veteran from Boston is to be named a knight of the French Legion of Honor, the highest distinction in France, next week.\nDavid Charter, born and raised in Dorchester, enlisted in the US Army Air Forces at 17 and flew 43 missions, fighting in battles like D-Day and the Battle of the Bulge.\n\t\n“I was always frightened,” Charter said of his time at war. But, he said, “it was a job that had to be done, and I did it.\xa0.\xa0. France understood what we had to go through.”The Legion of Honor, established in 1802 by Napoleon Bonaparte, was opened to US military veterans 10 years ago, on the 60th anniversary of D-Day. Charter is one of hundreds of veterans from New England to receive the honor and one of about 100 from Boston, said Timothy Deer, assistant to the consul general at the French Consulate in Boston.“In particular,” reads the letter announcing Charter’s honor, “it is a sign of France’s infinite gratitude and appreciation for your personal and precious contribution to the United States’ decisive role in the liberation of our country during World War II.”Consul General Fabien Fieschi will formally present the award to Charter at his residence, the Hebrew Rehabilitation Center in Roslindale, on Thursday.Deer said the award is given to “anybody who’s done really exemplary things to advance French culture,” with the roster including “really remarkable Americans.” Charter, a ball-turret gunner in B-17 and B-24 bombers, “obviously .\xa0.\xa0. put his life at risk for the war.”Charter was permitted to leave high school in 1943 before \ngraduation so he could enlist. He lobbied for the position of ball-turret gunner, the most dangerous and difficult crew position on a bomber, said his son, Ed Charter. The role had Charter stationed in a cramped compartment on the underside of the plane, completely exposed to enemy fire.As part of Operation Carpetbagger, Charter’s plane would fly over occupied European territory to drop supplies to partisan fighters, often at night and under weather conditions considered nearly impossible to fly in, according to the website for the National Museum of the US Air Force.Charter also flew bombing missions, and he was aboard a plane that crash-landed near Paris. He and his crew were back on the next flight to their station in Cheddington, England, eagerly diving back into warfare after the accident, his son recalled.Charter is already heavily decorated. He has several Air Medals, an American Campaign Medal, the European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign Medal, and an Army Good Conduct Medal, among others.\n\nHowever, the war left its mark on Charter, who has battled post-traumatic stress disorder, according to his son.Asked about the French knighthood in a recent telephone interview, Charter simply said: “I feel very grateful. I feel very happy that it can finally be over .\xa0.\xa0. the world war.”
A 32-year-old woman wanted in connection for a fatal stabbing last month in New York was located and arrested this week in Boston, Boston police said.Chivona Hughes, 32, was wanted for stabbing the man 75 times in his home in Brooklyn, New York. on Sept. 21, Boston police said Friday in a posting on their blog. She was arrested around 3:30 p.m. Tuesday in the area of Blue Hill Avenue in Mattapan. \n\t\nNew York Police Department detectives asked the Boston police fugitive unit to assist with the search for Hughes after receiving information that she might be in the Boston area, Boston police said. Hughes was taken into custody, and charged with being a fugitive from justice, Boston police said.  Hughes has been returned to New York to face a murder charge. 
Many of them didn’t have time to pack their underwear.The residents of Joelyn’s Family Home were sitting for a meal of beef and broccoli Wednesday afternoon when a police officer burst into the newly renovated shelter on Long Island with bad news.\n\t\n“Don’t be alarmed, but we need you to get off the island,” the officer told the homeless women and the staff.Some of the  women, there for several months to recover from drug addictions, feared there had been a terrorist attack. They had no idea where they were going or what would become of them and their few possessions: pictures of their children, vital documents, medication, jewelry, bedding, their favorite jeans.The women panicked, and tears flowed as word spread that the old, rickety bridge from the mainland to their shelter in Boston Harbor had been condemned. All they knew was that they had to move quickly and leave behind anything they could not carry in a small bag.They didn’t know when, if ever, they would be allowed to return to their refuge.Mindy Miller, a senior counselor at the home, was sitting in her office when a friend called and asked if the rumors about the bridge were true. Moments later, the director came in and told her what the officer had said. They needed to convene a staff meeting immediately and conferred with other administrators of Victory Programs, their parent organization in Boston, which had recently spent $2 million on renovations.A wave of fear swelled as she realized what was happening.Miller assembled the 28 women in the shelter — six others were off the island — and explained what she could.“OK, girls, we have to evacuate,” she recalls telling  them. “We need to do this as soon as possible. We don’t know where everyone is going tonight. But you’ll all be safe.”Please stay calm, she urged,  though it was hard for her to follow her own advice.Miller and the other staff members could not believe the closure of the bridge had come so suddenly, and they were annoyed the police had not shared the news with them privately. They were galled that there was no advance planning and that they would have to figure out where to take the women as they evacuated.During two chaotic hours, they took what they could, and staff ushered them onto the program’s two large passenger vans.As one van rolled toward the rusted span, Miller recalled later, the anxiety surged.“Are we safe?” a woman asked in the back seat.Another responded: “I don’t want to go over the bridge.”Yet another said: “I hope we don’t fall in the water.”After Miller’s van crossed a portion of the 3,000-foot, two-lane bridge, she sought to allay their fears. “Don’t worry, girls, we just passed the part of the bridge they’re worried about,” she said. “We’re going to be safe.”The entire bridge was unsafe, she knew, but her words helped calm their nerves and got them across without any panic attacks.About a half mile later, Miller’s van parked in a large lot on Moon Island, where for years MBTA buses have brought more than 400 people every day to the island’s large emergency homeless shelter. \nIt was about 7 p.m. The lot was dark and filled with hundreds of people from the emergency shelter, Miller recalled, as well as from many of the other recovery programs on the island. There were people crying, knowing that they would be separated from friends and staff. Some complained that it was like they were being evicted all over again.Staff, too, were consoling each other, many of them expecting they were now probably out of a job.Miller called her director, who was still with the other van on the island. “This isn’t going to work,” she recalls telling her. “There are too many people here.”So they decided to meet in another lot near the Quincy T Station, where the six women who had been off the island met them. Staff members at their Boston headquarters were furiously searching for places where the women could stay.When they finally devised a plan, Miller and her colleagues asked the women, who ranged in age from 20 to 60, to stand in three different parking spaces in the lot, based on where they would be going. Ten found spare beds or couches with friends or family; 17 would be sent to homes run by Victory Programs in Dorchester and Jamaica Plain, and eight were going to a hotel in Randolph.The women headed to the hotel were particularly nervous, because some had to be at jobs in the morning and others had to be at early appointments at a methadone clinic in Boston.Miller said she went with the women to the hotel, where they squeezed into five rooms. She gathered them in one room and leveled with them.“We don’t know what’s going to happen,” she recalled telling them.But the women were among the island’s luckier residents, because their agency had vowed to find spaces for them.On Friday, Jonathan Scott, the chief executive of Victory Programs, said all the women were sent to other homes within the agency and the staff were able to collect some of their belongings on the island.But he was still fuming.“We were never given any indication that something like this was about to happen,” he said. “This has put our entire agency in a devastating, catastrophic financial crisis.”“I’ve never seen anything this ridiculous,” he said. “I’m still jumping out of my skin.”In an interview Friday, Mayor Martin J. Walsh said the rush to move the people off the island could not be avoided.“It’s unfortunate,” he said. “We found out that the bridge was structurally unsafe. I wasn’t going to risk keeping people on the island. .\xa0.\xa0.  I couldn’t afford to have somebody driving over the bridge and have the bridge collapse.”\nScott said he hoped the women could move back to Long Island soon, but he knew that was unlikely and that it may never happen.\n\n• \n• \n• \n\n\n• \n• \n• \n• \n• \n
One man died and a woman was hospitalized after a five-alarm fire tore through a duplex in Roxbury Friday night, Boston fire officials said.Gerry Fontana, chief of operations for the Boston Fire Department, said at the scene that one man was killed in the blaze. He said he did not know the victim’s age and he could not say where on the property the man was found. The victim, who was not identified, was pronounced dead at the scene. \n\t\nOfficials also said that a woman was taken to an area hospital for evaluation with injuries not considered severe. The woman is a resident of the house, said Steve MacDonald, a Boston Fire spokesman.The fire started at about 9 p.m. at 104 Winthrop St., which is part of a 3 1/2-story, wood frame duplex, the Fire Department said on Twitter. The department said the blaze had been contained at about 11:30 p.m.Fontana said it had not yet been determined where or how the fire started.At least 30 people were displaced from the six-family structure, according to MacDonald.“The fire was able to spread pretty quickly,” Fontana said.Officials said the blaze is being jointly investigated by the Fire Department, the Boston police homicide unit, and the Suffolk district attorney’s office, which is standard procedure in fatal fires.“It’s very sad,” Mayor Martin J. Walsh said at the scene.MacDonald said shortly after 10 p.m. that the fire was concentrated in the rear of the building, which will likely be a total loss.Fontana and MacDonald said firefighters expected to remain on Winthrop Street throughout the night and were working to keep the blaze from spreading to neighboring homes.Authorities could not immediately say if the victim was a resident of the duplex or visiting at the time of the fire.Delores Clark, 63, grew emotional as she recounted how she was watching television in her third-floor apartment when a smoke alarm went off.By the time she got down to the first floor, she said, the area was filled with black smoke.“Oh my God,” Clark said, “Oh my God. I’ve lived in this house since 1968 and it’s all gone. It’s all gone.”She said she was unable to take her cat with her. “I want my cat,” Clark shouted as people embraced her. “I want my cat!”Marsha Smith, who lives one street over, said she was driving on Winthrop with her grandson, Dwayne Poindexter, 33, who noticed the flames first and said, “Nana, pull over.”Smith said Poindexter ran into 106 Winthrop St., which is attached to 104, to alert residents of the fire, and he later came out with five or six people.“The flames were huge,” Smith said,” adding that she alerted neighbors to the fire.Smoke and flames billowed from the roof of property shortly before 10 p.m., as dozens of people gathered across the street.Sparks were also shooting through the roof. At least eight fire trucks were parked on Winthrop, and more were parked around the corner on Blue Hill Avenue.The fifth alarm was called at about 9:30 p.m.
\n inaugural address in 2010, former Boston Mayor Thomas Menino envisioned a new Boston teeming with young techies working in industry clusters and living in semi-communal housing — Geekville, you might say. But the elderly, it turns out, are the fastest growing demographic group in Boston, according to a major housing report released this week by Boston Mayor Martin Walsh. Geezerville may turn out to be a more accurate moniker for Boston in the near future.By 2030, according to the report, the city’s senior set will increase by 22,400 households. People of retirement age will account for one in five Boston households. And \nthe bulk of new retirees will toss aside the Florida condo brochures and choose to “age in place.” \n\t\nIt’s great that seniors feel so comfortable here. But this is a potential housing nightmare for middle-income families who are already having trouble gaining a foothold in Boston. Increasingly, they will find themselves squeezed on one side by seniors who occupy large homes and on the other side by 20,000 undergraduates who drive up rents by sharing off-campus apartments. The middle class in this city can’t buy a break.And to get one, they’ll have to depend on courage that they haven’t yet seen from Mayor Walsh.Walsh’s administration understands the problem. The city’s population is on track to exceed 700,000 for the first time since the 1950s, according to the study. But unlike in those simpler times, Boston in 2030 won’t be chock-a-block with families of eight living in three-bedroom apartments. With fewer people inhabiting each unit, the pressure on the housing stock will grow even greater.To cope, the administration has set the goal of . In the introduction to the 131-page report, “Housing a Changing City: Boston 2030,” Walsh unambiguously accepts the challenge of putting the new housing plan into action. That’s huge. Until now, no one in the city could figure out where the mayor actually stood on housing. He clearly understands the wisdom of building higher, denser housing developments, especially along public transit lines. And his many friends in the building trades are urging him forward. Yet Walsh seems to freeze when confronted by NIMBY-minded residents who reflexively oppose any new construction.Last spring, Walsh became nervous about the height of a modest, 13-unit condo project proposed for a lot across the street from the Savin Hill T station. It’s all of three stories. Now, the developer is on the verge of giving up after enduring the inescapable “community process.” For months, Walsh was eerily quiet on a sensible proposal to build a 27-unit apartment building adjacent to the Fairmount commuter rail station in Hyde Park. Neighbors want to kill that development, too. But it is slowly and painfully winding its way through the approval process now that the mayor seems slightly more comfortable with the site. At this pace, the 53,000 units of new housing will take forever. And again, it is the middle class that will suffer most.The high cost of land and labor here practically forces developers to build luxury units or tap into government funds available for the construction of subsidized housing for the poor. Meanwhile, families earning a respectable income of $80,000 can only afford the bottom quarter of the homeownership market in Boston. And while there are a lot of new apartments in the pipeline, they are likely to rent for upwards of $3,500.The Walsh administration’s housing plan provides good data, detailed projections, and smart analysis. And it offers strategies to solve the problem: zoning relief in locations with good access to transit; temporary relief from property taxes in special middle-income development areas; market incentives to develop 3,500 new units of senior housing as a way for the elderly to downsize; and the creation of 16,000 new undergraduate dorm beds along with off-campus student villages.But how willing is Walsh to fight this battle? If the mayor is serious, we should soon see him blasting through the NIMBY barricades and convincing his buddies in the building trades to bring down construction costs on homes for middle class families earning in the $50,000 to $100,000 range. Walsh needs to shout his support for an aggressive housing policy from Boston’s rooftops. No more padding softly around the living room. 
Aaron Hernandez, the former New England Patriot charged with killing three people, suffered a legal setback Friday when a Bristol Superior Court judge denied his motion to toss key evidence from the athlete’s cellphone.In a 22-page ruling, Judge E. Susan Garsh wrote that Hernandez’s lawyers voluntarily turned over the phone to State Police on the evening of June 18, 2013, one day after the killing of Odin Lloyd, 27, of Dorchester.\n\t\nHernandez, 24, and two co-defendants, Carlos Ortiz, 28, and Ernest Wallace, 42, have pleaded not guilty to murder charges in the slaying of Lloyd, whose bullet-riddled body was found in an industrial yard near Hernandez’s North Attleborough home.According to court records, Hernandez’s lawyers argued that State Police obtained the phone from one of his lawyers at the Boston office of Ropes & Gray under a “false claim of legal authority,” which Garsh rejected.A warrant had authorized State Police to seize the phone from Hernandez, but when troopers searched his house on June 18, the device was at his lawyers’ office, records show. \nPatrick Bomberg, a Bristol County prosecutor, informed Hernandez’s defense team that officials had a warrant for their client’s phone.“At no point during this conversation did Bomberg, explicitly or implicitly, claim authority under the warrant to send a state trooper to the offices of Ropes & Gray to seize the phone or indicate that the State Police were on the way to Ropes & Gray to seize the phone under the authority of the warrant,” Garsh wrote.One of Hernandez’s lawyers, Robert Jones, later handed over the phone to a trooper.“The turning over of the phone was a voluntary act,” Garsh wrote. “It was not the result of force, threat, trickery, duress, or coercion.”The ruling is significant in part because Hernandez allegedly texted Lloyd in the hours before the killing, including one message where he arranged to pick up Lloyd at his Dorchester residence.“I’m coming to grab that tonight,” Hernandez texted, according to court records. “u gon b around I need dat and we could step for a little again.”Prosecutors have also said that Hernandez summoned Wallace and Ortiz to Massachusetts from Connecticut via text message in the hours before the murder.A spokesman for District Attorney C. Samuel Sutter declined to comment on Garsh’s ruling, citing a gag order. A lawyer for Hernandez did not return a call seeking comment.In a related ruling, Garsh also allowed other evidence seized from Hernandez’s home, including a square-shaped bowl that authorities believed contained marijuana residue and a scale next to the dish. Garsh, however, ruled out using a white towel found at the house as evidence.Prosecutors had said the towel appeared similar to one observed in service station surveillance camera images of the occupants of Hernandez’s vehicle around the time of the killing and appeared similar to a towel found at the murder scene.Also Friday, Garsh rejected a motion from Shayanna Jenkins, the mother of Hernandez’s child, to dismiss a perjury indictment pending against her. Jenkins is charged with lying to the grand jury hearing evidence in Lloyd’s slaying.Garsh wrote that the grand jury heard “probable cause” to believe Jenkins had lied, including when she responded “not from my knowledge, no,” when asked on the stand in August 2013 if she had spoken to Wallace after Lloyd’s death in June.Telephone records indicate that Wallace and Jenkins exchanged 11 calls on the day after Lloyd’s killing, according to court filings.Jenkins’s lawyer could not be reached for comment on Friday night. She remains free on personal recognizance.Prosecutors on Friday also filed their opposition to a motion from Hernandez’s lawyers to move his trial out of Bristol County, writing that while media coverage of the case has been extensive, “the defend-ant has failed to show that it has so inflamed and pervasively prejudiced” potential jur-ors.In a separate case, Hernandez has pleaded not guilty in Suffolk County to murder charges in the 2012 fatal drive-by shootings of two men in Boston’s South End.\n
Mayor Martin J. Walsh’s administration is preparing the canvas for an 18-month citywide “cultural planning process” to put the arts at the heart of the city’s future for at least the next decade, for artists, residents, and visitors alike.Under incoming Boston chief of arts and culture Julie Burros, the process can consider anything from festivals to public art, and from easier permitting for neighborhood arts events to affordable housing for artists who might otherwise move somewhere else to work. Everything is on the table.\n\t\n“Some people won’t quite understand at first, but as they start to see public art show up on the street, as they see movement in different avenues, they’ll be, ‘Wow, this is incredible,’” said Walsh, who made the arts a centerpiece of his campaign. “They might not realize it at first, but we’ll tie it all in as time goes on.”The \n and the , both Boston-based and already teaming up on arts funding, will fund the process, estimated to cost somewhere between $250,000-$600,000.“I think this process is going to be really fundamental to the way Boston looks and feels for the next 10 years,” says steering committee member Eve Ewing, a writer and poet from Roxbury.Organizers expect to reach out widely to artists, arts leaders, patrons, audiences, and the public at large.“What do we want the city to look like on the cultural level? How do we make this city stand out with major cities in the rest of the world in terms of raising the level of our cultural life?” said steering committee member Miguel Rodriguez, executive director of Boston Baroque. “It’s going really in-depth and looking at what the communities and the neighborhoods are going to need, and how we all in the cultural sector can help to advance our artists and our organizations and our communities.”A request has gone out for proposals from arts consulting firms nationwide, with an Oct. 27 deadline for bids. The consultants will help city officials collect and analyze data and present the results. The bids will include their suggested outline for how the process will be conducted.\nThe project’s 15-member steering committee — including representatives from the city, the foundations, and local arts groups — will recommend a consultant, with Walsh making the final choice. Work begins in earnest by the first of next year, with final recommendations complete by June 2016.\nBurros knows what’s ahead when she starts work in December. She was chosen as the city’s first cabinet-level chief of arts and culture in years in part because she was a key mover behind Chicago’s cultural plan in 2012. Chicago, Burros said, provided $1 million to start enacting their plan’s recommendations.“We did it at kind of a breakneck speed,” she said, with dozens of meetings large and small across Chicago in just a few months. “At the end of our public process I had pneumonia,” she added with a laugh, “so I want to take better care of myself in Boston.”The process began in Boston even before the mayoral election, when Barr broached the idea to the Walsh campaign. Barr is paying for local consultant group Technical Development Corporation to study other cities’ cultural planning processes around the country. Barr has already funded a part-time employee at City Hall to manage early stages of the process.“The comment will be made, ‘With all the urgent pressing issues facing society today, why is it you’re funding in the arts?’” said Barr president and trustee James E. Canales. “We need to shift the frame from the idea that the arts are a ‘nice to have’ to really looking at the arts as a must-have in the community.“If you care about a community that is vibrant, that is seeking engagement from all of its citizens, that is looking for ways to spark and support creativity … arts and culture has to be at the center of your community,” Canales said.Walsh vows a plan with short- and long-term goals and clear criteria for success, so residents will see results. Barr and Klarman also pledge to help make sure that the recommendations can be enacted and will consider funding projects where needed. “This is a foundation that cares deeply about the future of this region .\xa0.\xa0.  and always wants to take the long-term view,” Canales said.Everyone involved expects the study to have a wide-angle lens.“You’re talking about the arts in terms of how the community supports artists and arts organizations but also, and just as importantly, what’s the role of the arts in education, what’s the role of the arts in housing, what’s the role of the arts in development?” said steering committee member Michael Maso, managing director of the Huntington Theatre Company.\nPlayers from Walsh on down say it’s important that the plan involve all sectors of the city’s arts community, from the Huntington and the Museum of Fine Arts down to storefront galleries and fringe theater groups in neighborhoods far from the Avenue of the Arts.“The image of Boston that exists both here in the city and also nationally and internationally does not accurately reflect a lot of the really vibrant cultural work and arts communities that are present in the city,” said Ewing, who serves as development manager for the youth art group Urbano Project in Jamaica Plain. “There are so many people here doing incredible work that does not get the recognition and material support that it needs to get to continue thriving.”“Hopefully all of the people whose voices need to be heard will be heard, and then we’ll make sure there’s a wide array of initiatives in the plan,” said Joyce Linehan, Walsh’s policy chief, who has been handling many of what will be Burros’s duties.In San Jose, Calif., one of the cities TDC studied, about 3,000 people participated directly in the process, said Kerry Adams Hapner, director of cultural affairs for the city, who oversaw the process there in 2009-2011. She calls the cultural plan “a mobilizing tool” for the city, arts groups, and funders, and notes that San Jose has raised about $2 million in new grants and sponsorships since the plan was put to work.In Boston, many noted a renewed emphasis on understanding the arts’ contribution, citing two recent studies, the MFA’s CultureTrack study of Boston audiences and ArtsBoston’s The Arts Factor, on economic and other impacts.The Walsh administration knows it has to produce results once the plan is done. “We all have hopes and dreams and wishes for things we want to see, but unless we have a path for getting there, it’s just an exercise,” said Linehan.\n\n• \n•  \n• \n
The cause of a five-alarm fire in Roxbury late Friday night is under investigation, as is the death of a man, believed to be in his 40s, whose body was recovered from the burning building on Winthrop Street, officials said Saturday.A firefighter suffered heart issues during the blaze, said Boston Fire Department spokesman Steve MacDonald, and was treated and released. A woman who was a resident of the home was taken to the hospital for evaluation, he said. \n\t\nAt least 30 other residents in the six-family structure were displaced. The Red Cross helped 27 displaced people, according to Jessica Emond, director of communications. It provided food, clothing, “comfort kits” with toiletries, and helped with hotel arrangements. It also brought a mental health specialist to the scene. On Saturday, officials estimated damage to the 3½-story, wood structure at about $1.1 million. “It’s a complete loss,” said MacDonald. “My estimate would be that it will be unoccupied for at least a year.”\n\nOn Saturday afternoon, the smell of fire still filled the air near the apartment building, and caution tape blocked part of the Street. Utility workers dug in front of the building, shutting down services to the building. The identity of the man found dead was not released. The fire, which officials said was concentrated at the rear of the building, started at about 9 p.m. and was contained at around 11:30 p.m., officials said. The blaze is being jointly investigated by the Fire Department, the Boston police homicide unit, and the Suffolk district attorney’s office, which is standard procedure in fatal fires.
The plans for the long-stalled Madison Park High School in November 1966 were the grandest ever pitched for a Boston public school, startling city councilors during a presentation that made front-page news the next day.The campus-style high school in Roxbury — a neighborhood where educational opportunities had long been short-changed — would boast an Olympic-sized swimming pool, a television studio, and possibly a nightclub or coffeehouse for teenagers. There would be seven buildings total, including a venue inspired by the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts in New York City and a vocational-education center geared for students and adults alike. \n\t\n“This high school will be the salvation of the Boston school system,” city development director Edward J. Logue\n boldly predicted. “It will give Latin School a run for its money.”\n\nThose lofty aspirations would never come to be.Instead of delivering salvation to a school system battling racial inequality, Madison Park repeatedly emerged over the ensuing decades as a symbol of educational failure, bureaucratic neglect, and lingering racial tensions.Even the opening of the complex in 1977 — years behind schedule — brought mounting disappointment. Construction problems forced students to eat cold meals for six weeks. The swimming pool was unusable. A city fiscal crisis threatened plans to build the vocational center. The growing list of problems was “like a cancer eating at the school,” the head of the parent council told the Boston Herald in 1978.\nThe troubled history of Madison Park offers insight into why Boston has failed generations of its students who desire to learn a trade or technical skills — often to boost themselves out of a life of poverty — and why local employers have to tap out-of-state workers for jobs that otherwise could have gone to residents a few blocks away.It also raises questions, as Boston faces another urgent crisis to turn around Madison Park, about what it will take for the city to develop a top-notch vocational high school, like those that thrive in almost every corner of the state, or whether it is doomed to repeat the failures of its past.“Madison Park has tremendous potential if we could ever get it together,” said Michael Contompasis, a former Boston school superintendent, noting that Worcester has transformed its vocational school into a national model. “It’s a question of leadership, it’s a question of political will, and it’s a question of rethinking all the recommendations ever made.”Some educators and education advocates in the city question whether the problems facing Madison Park are surmountable, \nand believe Boston should consider starting \n\na new vocational school from scratch. The decades of disappointment, they say, have bred a deeply rooted culture of distrust and entrenched territorialism within the school and the neighborhood around it.Overhaul efforts through the years have often stalled or failed as teachers, community activists, and political leaders have clashed over philosophical differences in how to push the school forward, and debates over whether motives were fueled by the interest of students or personal or political agendas.Looming over these fights is a School Department that state and city leaders have criticized for valuing college preparatory programs over vocational education and for lacking a basic understanding of what it takes to train students for technical careers or the trades. That has led to ill-fated decisions, such as appointing headmasters without the appropriate expertise, and filling seats at Madison Park with students who have failing grades, disciplinary problems, and no interest in vocational education.\nYet every time state or city officials propose spinning off Madison Park from the city school system, allowing it to operate as an independent school system like nearly every other vocational school across the state, the School Department balks. Some teachers get nervous they will lose their jobs or protection under the Boston Teachers Union contract, and community activists protest, fearing such a move could prevent fewer Roxbury students from enrolling.Just this summer, an intervention team, appointed by Interim Superintendent John McDonough and the Boston Teachers Union to craft a set of remedies for Madison Park, recommended closing the school in three years and replacing it with a regional vocational school at another site if a turnaround fails. McDonough rejected the idea.“It is my belief and intent to focus on success rather than planning for failure,” McDonough said. But he acknowledged the challenges are immense, including developing a new culture and mindset at the school.“I think you have a lot of frustration among faculty and particularly the students who say that we keep promising stuff and not delivering,” McDonough said in an interview, vowing the School Department would do better. “We have an opportunity now to deliver. It does require changes, but it can be done.” \nAs school opened this fall, the situation at Madison Park could not have been more bleak. The school scrambled to hire nearly 60 teachers and administrators in August, and some positions remain unfilled. Many students and teachers went about a week without a legitimate class schedule, prompting students to demonstrate.Headmaster Diane Ross Gary, who took the reins just a year earlier, resigned a few days later, as a growing number of teachers, students, and parents called for her termination. The School Department had resisted firing her for months, and several black political leaders and community activists had lobbied Mayor Martin J. Walsh to keep her in the post, saying she deserved more time to prove herself.In the end, Gary, who had no prior experience as a headmaster, had failed to gain state certification to lead a school in Massachusetts.All of this occurred as Madison Park was supposed to be starting the third year of a turnaround effort that was pushed by then-mayor Thomas M. Menino, who promised in his 2012 State of the City address to transform the school into a critical job training center for students and adults alike.Each year of the turnaround has been marked by notable missteps. Scores on the Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System exams this spring dropped in each subject area. In science, for instance, just 3 percent of 10th-graders scored proficient, down from 25 percent who scored proficient or advanced the previous year. The school’s graduation rate of 63.6 percent, while largely improving, still remains more than 20 percentage points below the state average. “We have kids here who can’t read,” said one teacher who was not authorized to speak to the news media. “We have a huge problem with kids who can’t do fractions. To me that’s a real crisis.”The poor academic achievement, combined with student behavior problems, severely restricts the school’s ability to place students in apprenticeship programs, a key path to employment.Vocational education experts also say Madison Park is not establishing enough placements in small private businesses, which are more apt to hire students after graduation than large corporations or government agencies. The dismal record has Mitchell Chester, the state commissioner of elementary and secondary education, contemplating whether he should formally declare the school “underperforming,” a move that could set the stage for state receivership in three years absent a dramatic turnaround. A decision is expected in the coming weeks.\nBoston’s early problems with vocational education were rooted in racial inequities that prompted federal court intervention. White students typically attended high schools with more modern facilities than those used by black and Latino students at the crumbling Boston Trade High School in Mission Hill.\nUS District Judge W. Arthur Garrity Jr. embraced the Madison Park project, calling it the “keystone” of his plans in the 1970s to desegregate the public schools. A team of experts traveled across the country to develop the programming for what would be called the Humphrey Occupational Resource Center, which opened in 1980 at the Madison Park complex. Initially, the Humphrey Center taught students for a half-day from all the high schools across the city who wanted to learn a trade, and it operated separately from Madison Park High School, which at the time had a strong focus on music. States across the nation had successfully used half-day programs, but in Boston the arrangement would be short-lived. Confronted with declining enrollment at both the Humphrey Center and Madison Park, the School Committee voted in 1986 to merge the two amid budget-cutting. It also decided to give away a chunk of the complex, including the science building and later the music center, to a new exam school, now called the O’Bryant School of Math and Science.The merger did not go well. Within a few years, state education officials placed several vocational programs on probation.“It was a travesty of epic proportions,” said Judith Baker, who taught English at Madison Park from 1979 to 2005 and is now a member of the Friends of Madison Park. “The parents were right to be angry. Madison Park began to deteriorate as a technical school. The superintendent of schools didn’t believe in vocational education at all. We didn’t have any defenders.”\nTo this day, the repercussions of the merger resonate, contributing to an identity crisis that has lasted to this day over whether Madison Park is truly a citywide vocational high school or a neighborhood high school for Roxbury that happens to have vocational programs as electives, said Charles Lyons, the superintendent-director of Shawsheen Valley Technical High School in Billerica and a member of the Madison Park intervention team.He said the key to Madison Park’s future success is to sever it from the school system and have an independent board of experts run it.“The kids are worthy of a high-quality first-class technical education,” Lyons said. “Boston has the financial capability to provide it. The adults have to make it happen.”State education officials first raised the idea of independent oversight in the late 1980s, believing it was the only way to ensure Madison Park would get the appropriate attention. But the School Department resisted.Then-mayor Raymond Flynn, concerned that Boston was failing to prepare enough students for jobs on the Big Dig and other major projects, called for Madison Park to become an independent vocational school in his 1992 State of the City address. But the proposal sparked bitter protests from students, community activists, and disaffected faculty, who repeatedly spread false rumors that Flynn wanted to give away seats to suburbanites.\n\n\nA year later, students descended on City Hall to protest. Menino, who was preparing to become acting mayor because Flynn was departing to become ambassador to the Vatican, met with a few of the students. After they emerged from the meeting, other protesters pelted Menino with snowballs, even though he remained undecided about the proposal.The issue ultimately proved too toxic during a mayoral election year and it died.Madison Park slipped from the headlines, and with a skilled headmaster at the helm for a few years, the school enjoyed an academic reemergence. But that, too, would be short-lived, undermined by a succession of headmasters and then a laser-like focus on improving MCAS scores, sacrificing time in vocational education classes for test prep.Menino would not enter the fray of turning around Madison Park again until his 2012 speech, setting off a new round of acrimony.On the morning students protested last month — demanding their class schedules immediately — a handful of carpentry students, who had already been assigned some courses, were on the other side of Roxbury, pouring cement for the foundation of a single-family house they are helping to build.Madison Park teachers, administrators and supporters point to the activity on the job site that morning as evidence that good things are happening there. “The staff has worked very hard to make sure the school is moving forward and are trying to make sure the education is current and relevant and prepares them for the future,” said Al Holland, the school’s acting headmaster.\nOn a tour of the 900-student school one recent morning, the chaos of last month appeared to have subsided. Nicely painted hallways were quiet. Freshmen in one math class listened carefully to a lesson on solving algebraic equations; students in the electrical shop diligently wired light switches; and students donned chef caps as they sliced peaches for a cobbler.Teachers talked enthusiastically about their programs and grooming students for the workforce or college. Vincent Fanuele, a carpentry teacher, said one of his most important tasks is “to develop their character and their professional skills.” A group of seniors studying automotives said the school has helped them see the merits of going to college. Some talked of becoming engineers; others to get more advanced credentials to be mechanics.”This school has opened my eyes to so many things I never knew before,”",

Teal, a crossing guard at the Patrick Lyndon School in West Roxbury, said she is deeply grateful for the award, but never expected it. The satisfaction she has received over the last 15 years helping students cross the street safely is validation enough, she said.“The parents and the children just bring me so much joy, and they should be getting the award instead because they don’t know what they do for me,” Teal said. “They are my prescription and my therapy for the occasional stresses in my life.”And then there’s George Kincaid, 66, a disabled man who has devoted his life to making Boston more accessible for other handicapped people through the Inspectional Services Department.“I have always just loved working . . . and helping people,” said Kincaid, an associate inspection engineer for the department. “I’m honored to receive the award, but I’m just going to try and not let it get to my head.”This year’s other recipients of Shattuck awards include: Paul Donga, supervisor and fire protection engineer for the Fire Department; Ellen Hatch, a senior analyst for the Office of Budget Management; Dion Irish, executive director of the Office of Fair Housing and Equity; Kevin J. Linsky, a senior civil engineer of highway construction in the Public Works Department; and Annie B. Wilcox, a community services officer for the Police Department.In addition to the Shattuck Public Service Awards, the research bureau annually honors a business leader and a nonprofit leader who have made significant contributions to Boston. This year’s Shattuck City Champions are Donna Cupelo, region president of Verizon New England, and Michael Brown, cofounder and chief executive of City Year.
HAVERHILL — Looking for a beautiful place to walk or jog, or a picturesque place to picnic? Head to Winnekenni Castle in Haverhill.This urban oasis is located not far from downtown, but feels like a world away. After you turn off Route 110, you’ll find yourself going up a winding road with tall trees on both sides. This shaded corridor continues up a hill and suddenly gives way to a view of an expansive green lawn and a medieval stone castle. It’s a majestic edifice from another time with stately towers and thick battlements silently standing guard atop a hill above Kenoza Lake. The walkways in front of the castle are lined with white, pink, and yellow flowers. It’s like a scene from a fairy tale.\n\t\nThe architecture may have been inspired by the Middle Ages, but the structure itself is not as ancient as it appears. It was built as a summer home for Dr. James R. Nichols, a Dartmouth-educated researcher and inventor who started his own chemical and pharmaceutical company. Inspired by the mighty English castles of yore, Nichols used locally-sourced rocks, stones, and boulders to build a castle of his own right here. Construction began in 1873 and took two years. The City of Haverhill purchased the property in 1895. It has been used as a public park ever since. A fire destroyed the interior of the castle in the 1960s, so there are no longer any visible traces of the grand Victorian home that Nichols created for himself. Inside the castle had to be rebuilt. It has an open layout now, with plain walls that are modern and white. But outside, the castle’s gray stone walls are intact, and look the same as they did when they were built.This anachronistic landmark is surrounded by hundreds of acres of conservation land and several miles of wooded trails. Sounds of nature fill the air. When you hear the birds chirping, small animals rustling through the underbrush, the breeze blowing the leaves on the trees, you quickly forget you’re in Haverhill.Winnekenni hosts a variety of events throughout the year: concerts, car shows, and even psychic nights. The castle is also available to rent for private functions, and is probably one of the most affordable wedding venues around, with rates starting as low as $200 for four hours on an “off-peak” day (Monday through Thursday). On a recent Sunday afternoon, my traveling companion and I paid a visit. We saw couples strolling hand-in-hand around the castle, and people walking their dogs on leashes. There are picnic tables on the lawn in front, a perfect spot for a meal. Down by the lake, mothers and young children walked along the shady paths. The dirt trails are wide and easy to navigate. In the wintertime, they are used for cross-country skiing and snowshoeing. There’s a small pond at the entrance of the park, known as the Basin, where fishing and ice skating is allowed. But don’t try that on the larger body of water that dominates the park;  all water activities — swimming, fishing, boating, skating — are strictly prohibited on Kenoza Lake, because it’s a reservoir. We walked along the dirt trail, surrounded by tall trees swaying in the wind, marveling at how quiet it was. At one point, we reached a small clearing, and found the Dudley Porter fountain, a large granite monument named after a former Haverhill park commissioner. It was dedicated in 1906, and once upon a time held a working fountain, flanked by elegantly curved benches. Water used to flow from a natural spring through a bronze lion’s head in the center of the massive monument, but, alas, no more. No more lion’s head either. Was it stolen, I wondered?I thought about this as we walked the trails and admired the pristine shoreline of Kenoza Lake, as people have done for many centuries, since long before there were settlers here. This is the same scenery that the poet John Greenleaf Whittier looked at in the 19th century, when he wrote “Kenoza Lake.” \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat fountainhead may be gone, but thankfully, the walls of Winnekenni Castle still stand, the beauty of this place has survived, and Whittier’s words live on. \n\n
\n\n\n of Uniontown, Ohio, is the mother of an adorable 2-year-old girl named Payton, whom she and her partner call a “dream come true” and love with all their heart. “She’s made us the people that we are,” Cramblett says. “Never trade it for the world.”If that’s the case, Payton will doubtless wonder, once she’s old enough to Google her own name, why did Cramblett  that enabled her to get pregnant with her wonderful daughter? Why did she demand tens of thousands of dollars as compensation for breach of warranty and for what the lawsuit calls Payton’s “wrongful birth?” \n\t\nThe answer, Cramblett and her lawyers  in televised interviews, has nothing to do with Payton, and everything to do with punishing the sperm bank for a careless mix-up: It supplied vials of sperm from Donor No. 330, when Cramblett had selected Donor No. 380. When Cramblett tried to untangle the matter with the sperm bank, she says, the receptionist was rude and hung up on her. “I am happy that I have a healthy child,” Cramblett . “But I’m not going to let them get away with not being held accountable.” But Cramblett’s suit against Midwest Sperm Bank hasn’t become a cause célèbre because of a customer service issue. It ignited a furor because of race. Cramblett was inseminated with the sperm of a black man, instead of the blonde-haired, blue-eyed white man she and her partner had picked from the sperm bank’s catalogue of donors. Which means that Payton is biracial — or to use Cramblett’s phrase, “obviously mixed race.” Hence the lawsuit, and the demand for at least $50,000 in damages. After all, the Ohio couple wasn’t expecting to have to raise a child with skin darker than theirs.Did somebody say racist? No, no, no, Cramblett insists, this isn’t about race at all. “For people to think I don’t want this child because of her skin tone is just not the case,” . And when Payton is older, she’ll understand that “the lawsuit was about a company that had to make changes and give us compensation so that we can go through counseling and learn how to love each other even more.”Sure she will. Because parents who adore their children as a “dream come true” and wouldn’t trade them “for the world” always file wrongful-birth lawsuits. Don’t they?It’s hard to decide which is more surreal — the race-obsessed complaint Cramblett , or her after-the-fact pretense that she isn’t making an issue of her daughter’s race. Cramblett wants to be paid handsomely for the “personal injuries, medical expense, pain, suffering, emotional distress, and other economic and non-economic losses” caused by Payton’s birth. Those hardships include having white relatives who can be “unconsciously insensitive,” and Cramblett’s “anxiety” at the prospect of enrolling her daughter in an all-white school. Uniontown — the Akron suburb to which Cramblett relocated with her partner for its good schools — she now regards as “too racially intolerant.” That’s not all that Cramblett has found “stressful” about motherhood. “Payton has hair typical of an African American girl,” the lawsuit notes. “To get a decent cut, Jennifer must travel to a black neighborhood, far from where she lives, where she is obviously different in appearance, and not overtly welcome.” Well. If that doesn’t merit a wrongful-birth lawsuit, what does?Poor Payton. One day she’ll read the court documents in this case and realize that her mother saw racism everywhere she looked, when the only person flipping out about giving birth to a biracial daughter was Payton’s mother herself. When the sperm bank receptionist asked Cramblett whether she had selected an African-American donor, the Ohio woman snapped: “No, why would I request that? My partner and I are Caucasian.” When she learned that her sperm donor wasn’t white after all, she admits, she was filled with “anger, disappointment, and fear.”Midwest Sperm Bank acknowledges its blunder, and it ought to face some legal repercussion for its sloppy record-keeping. But Cramblett could have gotten pregnant by Donor No. 380 and still ended up with a daughter very different from what she expected. Payton could have been born with Down syndrome or deafness; she could have had cystic fibrosis or a congenital heart defect. Then whom would her mother be targeting in a lawsuit? Having a baby isn’t like ordering a pair of jeans — . Anyone who thinks they are entitled to exactly the child they envisioned — and are prepared to fly to court if they don’t get it — isn’t fit to be a parent. The world is full of people whose conception was in some way unplanned or unexpected. That doesn’t make their births wrongful or a reason to play the race card. For Payton’s sake, let’s hope her mother figures that out, and soon.

\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nON ALCATRAZ ISLAND, Calif. — John Hernan dug through memories from six decades back when he patrolled this rock as a correctional officer. And his 93-year-old blue eyes lit up at the mention of basketball.“If I would’ve known that  were going to be here today,” said Hernan, pointing at the reporter from Boston, “then I would have brought with me a photograph.”\n\t\nA heartbeat later, Hernan was presented with a black-and-white photo, dated 1956.“That’s it!” he said.In early August, Hernan ferried over to this windswept 22-acre island dotting San Francisco Bay for the 80th anniversary of the federal penitentiary’s opening, an event organized by the National Park Service, which runs Alcatraz as a historic site. Hernan was joined by fellow former officers, ex-convicts, and family members who lived here when America’s most notorious prison operated from 1934-63.But in the infirmary ward on the second floor of the ancient cellhouse, where park rangers served lunch, Hernan found himself discussing two Celtics Hall of Famers and a moment that has all but slipped through the cracks of time.He eyed the photograph, recognizing the faces: Bill Russell on the left, in the hat, and K.C. Jones in the middle, with the picturesque smile, both of them baby-faced, just weeks removed from winning a second straight NCAA title with the University of San Francisco Dons. And on the far right, a Jesuit priest, Father Richard Scannell.Then Hernan unspooled an improbable story that even his son had never heard; a story that historians, researchers, archivists, and others associated with the prison, the college, and the area had never heard; a story that some USF players on those teams had never heard; a story that, for some reason, never made the newspapers back then and stayed below the radar since.It is a story that has faded as those who were there when it unfolded fell ill or died. The few tied to Alcatraz who are still alive — many in their 80s and 90s — refer to themselves as an “endangered species.” But Hernan, who worked at the prison known as “The Rock” from 1955-58, was there. And he remembers.“I’ll never forget that day,” he said.\nOn that day, USF’s starting five — Russell, Jones, Hal Perry, Carl Boldt, and Mike Farmer — received an unprecedented tour of the prison while it still housed the worst of the worst, a collection of rotten apples US officials feared couldn’t be confined in any other barrel, a place especially suited for kingpin gangsters such as Al “Scarface” Capone, Meyer “Mickey” Cohen, and James “Whitey” Bulger.But this crop of most-wanted murderers, mobsters, and bank robbers didn’t greet the players like cold-blooded convicts known for their ruthlessness. Instead, they bubbled like giddy fans and treated them, as those on the trip recall, like “rock stars,” like “gods.”“The convicts looked at Russell and they were just in awe,” said Boldt, 81, a forward.Typically, civilians were never allowed beyond the visiting room, where they were separated from convicts by a thick glass partition, using a phone to communicate. Yet the players not only walked through the cellhouse, kitchen, hospital, recreation yard, and industry (where convicts worked), they even ate alongside them and met one who was segregated from all others: Robert Stroud, the famous “Birdman of Alcatraz,” a diagnosed psychopath serving a death sentence after killing a prison guard, his second murder.“In my time, I never saw any other civilians inside the cellhouse,” said Hernan, who escorted the players down “Broadway,” the central walkway between C and B blocks. “And now that you mention it, they would be the only civilians who walked down Broadway like they did.”With its cramped cells and harsh rules — at times, talking was forbidden — Alcatraz specialized in the hardest of hard time. “Break the rules and you go to prison,” it was said. “Break the prison rules, and you go to Alcatraz.”But it also tortured their psyche, for the mainland sat near enough, legend has it, that convicts could smell the sweet aroma wafting from the Ghirardelli Chocolate Factory, and could hear car horns and women’s laughter. The pleasures of a major metropolis were so close, and yet so far, separated by 1¼ miles of frigid water and cruel tides that swallowed several convicts during escape attempts. As convict Frank Weatherman said on the day the prison closed in 1963, “Alcatraz never was no good for nobody.”During the anniversary celebration, officers and ex-convicts recounted plenty of tales — many soaked in blood — that they would just as soon forget. “And every time I come back, I remember something else,” said Robert Luke, who as convict AZ1118 served from 1954-59 after attempting to escape Leavenworth Federal Penitentiary, where he was sent after being convicted of bank robbery with an automatic weapon.So the day Russell & Co. strolled through marked a true rarity: a memory convicts could savor. Which makes its lack of publicity all the more mysterious. For reasons no one can quite explain, the visit by the most popular sports team in the area — and the most dominant college basketball team in the country — stayed hidden, it appears, until Luke mentioned it halfway through his self-published book, “Entombed in Alcatraz,” released in 2011.“Everyone was startled to see them,” Luke wrote, “but it was a nice change.”A change that, however brief, allowed these notorious convicts to feel and act like regular joes, connected through something that has connected so many, no matter how different, for so long: sports.There is more to their trip, and to basketball’s story on Alcatraz. Radios. Gambling. Racial tension. A convict vote. Basketball goals erected in the recreation yard. Clint Eastwood. And, improbably, Rajon Rondo.And none of it would have unfolded without the warden, Paul Madigan.\nThere were no newspapers, magazines, radios, non-approved reading materials, or other forms of entertainment on Alcatraz. No discussing current events during once-per-month visits from family or friends. In short, no contact with the outside world.Regulations eventually loosened up, and a breakthrough came in 1955, when Madigan took charge.On Oct. 4 of that year, the Brooklyn Dodgers beat the New York Yankees in Game 7 of the World Series — and cheers echoed throughout the cellhouse as the nearly 260 convicts of Alcatraz listened along on radio headsets in their cells.According to Hernan, rumors of radio access had circulated for years, but Madigan, the third warden, was “the brains” behind the project.With Hernan supervising, a pair of convicts with backgrounds in electrical work installed two-channel radio jacks in each cell. From 5:30 p.m., when dinner ended, to lights out at 9:30, convicts could listen to either of the two stations, though George DeVincenzi, a correctional officer from 1950-57, said a control-center officer chose what programs were broadcast into the cells. Initially, DeVincenzi said, one station might carry Shirley Temple programming or a Hopalong Cassidy show, something of that sort. “Nothing of a crime nature,” he said.“When I got there, we were listening to ‘Amos ’n’ Andy’ and ‘The Lone Ranger,’ ” said Bill Baker, then AZ1259, who served from 1957-59 for counterfeiting. “By the time I left, we were listening to Elvis Presley and all the rock and roll.”The second channel often aired sports programs, such as San Francisco 49ers football and — once they moved from New York — San Francisco Giants baseball games.To the convicts, Hernan said, the new privilege was like Christmas.“They couldn’t believe it,” he said. “Neither could I.”When radio came to Alcatraz, the University of San Francisco, an urban Catholic school that didn’t even have its own gymnasium, was in the midst of one of the most dominant runs in college basketball history.Led by Russell, a 6-foot-9-inch center who picked the backboards clean and swatted almost every shot in sight, and Jones, a 6-1 defensive-minded floor general, the Dons won the 1954-55 championship and were steamrolling toward another a season later, with a winning streak that eventually reached a record 60 games and a style that would revolutionize basketball.A key element was coach Phil Woolpert’s “blitz,” which had the guards, especially Jones, applying hectic full-court pressure, forcing turnovers and cashing them in for layups. They could play extra aggressive knowing Russell had their backs.“Even if they broke the press and got down there in the middle, there he was, like a praying mantis,” said Bill Bush, 81, a USF guard.Russell boasted a monstrous 7-foot-4-inch wingspan, dinner-plate-sized hands that ultimately measured 10½ inches from wrist to fingertip, and as a college track star who excelled at the high jump, he could tattoo the backboard at 14 feet high.He was known to tell opponents, “If you come in to shoot a layup off me, you’d better bring your salt and pepper because you’ll be eating basketball.” \nBehind its blitz, USF opened up huge early leads, essentially ending games then. During the 1955-56 season, USF averaged 72 points while holding opponents to a measly 52.“That press, it just killed teams,” said Gene Brown, 78, a USF guard. The Dons hogged the local spotlight and dominated the San Francisco Chronicle’s sports section.“We were the darlings of San Francisco,” said Warren Baxter, 79, a USF guard.\nNaturally, USF games became a popular radio choice at Alcatraz, and even if many convicts weren’t from the area, they developed “hometown pride” in the Dons.“They were rooting for them,” said DeVincenzi, “and every now and then when they’d win, they’d scream and holler out at the end of the game.”Said Baker, “They were really popular at the time. We knew them. I loved them, K.C. Jones and Bill Russell. Oh, yeah. There were cheers.”But the games were more than entertainment for the convicts; they were a temporary escape from the harsh routine of their daily lives. Convicts spent at least 14 hours in their cells per day and up to 23 if they weren’t assigned an industry job.“One of our main distractions was sports,” said Baker, 81.It was also one of their only connections to the outside, such as in the prison’s early years, when loudspeakers in the recreation yard broadcast World Series games.“That was the only time I was there when they were allowed to listen to any kind of radio program,” said Frank Heaney, an officer from 1948-51.Just as radio came to the island, so too did newspapers. DeVincenzi said the Chronicle would deliver 25 copies of the sports section each day. “That was very, very popular,” he said.Baker recalled seeing the paper when he worked in the industry making white cotton gloves for the military.“It was against the rules to bring in any section of the paper at all,” Baker said, “but they turned a blind eye on the scores, and our boss in the glove shop always clipped them out and brought them in.”And so convicts ate up any news they could about the team.“You had to have something to get excited about on the outside, and that was one of the first things we had,” said Luke, 87.After his day shift at Alcatraz, Hernan attended night school at USF and saw many of the Dons’ wins.“The whole world knew that Bill Russell was not an ordinary basketball player,” Hernan said. “If ever there was a team leader, he was it. K.C. Jones was right behind him.”That season, the Dons became the first team in NCAA history to go undefeated, finishing 29-0, and Russell posted 26 points and 27 rebounds in the final against Iowa, an 83-71 win, giving the Dons back-to-back titles.The Chronicle called them “the finest undergraduate team since Naismith first hung the peach basket.” Utah coach Jack Gardner called them “the greatest team ever assembled.” And the convicts of Alcatraz wanted to meet them.\nScannell taught at USF, but he was also the Catholic chaplain at Alcatraz and was especially close with Madigan, an Irish Catholic who always had a good relationship with the Jesuit priests.“If the priests wanted to do something, that was just fine with my dad,” said Florence Stewart, Madigan’s daughter.So when the convicts asked Scannell if USF’s players could come visit, Scannell asked Madigan, a former college baseball player in Minnesota and a big sports fan himself. The answer came back: yes. “It sounds really, really strange,” Stewart said, “but my dad was all for that kind of thing.”Scannell then went to the players. Boldt remembered thinking, “I want to go to that one,” knowing that not just anyone was allowed on Alcatraz.To Farmer, a forward, the request didn’t seem unusual at first. “You just thought it was one of those perks of winning a championship,” said Farmer, 78.But once they got on the boat, Farmer said, he realized, “Wow, this is kind of special.”A key reason the players were invited, Hernan said, was that it was believed their appearance would boost the morale of the black convicts.“The priest said, ‘They’ve been having a little trouble over there, and if you guys go over, it would help out,’ ” Boldt said.Inside Alcatraz, blacks and whites remained divided in the chow hall, the recreation yard, the industry. And the black convicts were heavily outnumbered; of the more than 1,500 convicts locked up during the prison’s 29-year run, about 78 percent were white and about 18 percent were black.Race was no foreign issue to the Dons, who in 1954 — the same year Brown vs. Board of Education passed, declaring school segregation unconstitutional — became the first team to start three African-American players: Russell, Jones, and Perry, a guard.That decision led to problems for the team, especially on the road. Some hotels wouldn’t house the black players. Some restaurants wouldn’t serve them. Some fans shouted obscenities and threw coins at them.“It was hell, it was hell,” said Gene Brown, who would become San Francisco’s first black sheriff.Russell, who was born in the segregated South, would become an outspoken advocate of the Civil Rights movement in the ’60s, marching on Washington with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. But the Alcatraz visit proved to be among his earliest experiences with racial politics.\nFor the visit, the team dressed sharply, in jackets and ties.“The warden told us, ‘When you walk through the cell block, they’re going to announce you’re walking through,’ ” Boldt said.The reaction was something the players wouldn’t forget.“They all cheered us,” Boldt said. “They said, ‘That’s the way to go, Dons!’ “They treated us like we were gods. I’m not kidding. Like rock stars. That was it. “They all cheered and clapped their hands. They said to Russell, ‘That’s the way to go there, big black brother!’ They cheered us and they were very happy to have us there.”Convicts fired away with basketball questions and comments. One told Farmer, “I remember against SMU, you had 26 points in the Final Four. You were a great player.”But they were truly fond of Russell, who averaged 20.6 points and 21 rebounds that season.“They looked at Bill Russell like he was God,” Boldt said.Said Farmer, “He was very popular.”The convicts also brought up gambling, as it was popular for them to bet on games with cigarettes or food, such as a dessert or T-bone steak, said Pat Mahoney, a correctional officer and boat operator from 1956-63.“Some lost their lives over that expletive,” Mahoney said. “If you couldn’t pay up, you got shanked.”Boldt remembered one convict saying, “We always bet on USF.”“That’s a pretty good deal,” Boldt replied, “because we didn’t lose.”The players ate lunch in the chow hall. Alcatraz was known for having the best food in the correctional system, thanks to its first warden, James Johnston. Knowing that most prison riots and strikes stemmed from poor food, Johnston, a strict disciplinarian, wanted to keep Alcatraz’s notorious residents well-fed.The food, which was prepared by the convicts, was delicious, both Boldt and Farmer said. Boldt recalled prime rib as the main course, with apple pie for dessert. Farmer remembered Perry half-joking, “This is better than the food at USF.”During the meal, they sat alongside convicts. Boldt said he ate next to Morton Sobell, then AZ996, who had been famously tried and convicted with Ethel and Julius Rosenberg on espionage charges, specifically delivering classified information to the Soviets about the atomic bomb.Boldt had followed Sobell’s trial and was thrilled to meet him. “He was very nice to me, and very smart,” Boldt said. The two stayed in touch after that, writing letters.Farmer recalled meeting another famous convict: Stroud, then AZ594, who had been sentenced to life in solitary confinement after stabbing a Leavenworth guard to death in 1916, \ntransferred to Alcatraz in 1942.Other famous inmates during the time of the Dons’ visit included Ellsworth “Bumpy” Johnson, then AZ1117, a mob boss from Harlem, and kidnapper Alvin “Creepy” Karpis, then AZ325, a former Public Enemy No. 1.\nThe players walked through the industry, where Luke was working one of the industrial dryers.“And the funny thing is, I knew as soon as I saw Bill Russell come through the laundry who he was,” Luke said. “I don’t think I’d ever seen him before. I had never seen him before. And I don’t think I heard about him before I heard about him on the radio.”And when listening to the games, he heard Russell’s name constantly.“He was a dominant player,” Luke said. “There was no doubt about that. You understood that right away, and I was never even a basketball fan.”“For Christ’s sake,” Baker said, “he became one of the greatest basketball players — probably the best ever, and that’s including Michael Jordan, because he was such a great defensive presence. He changed the game.”Players also stopped near the island’s edge.“They the correctional officers showed us where they threw the food off the island to feed the sharks,” Farmer said. “That was always in view of where the inmates could see it, so they tried to attract sharks around Alcatraz there to keep people from trying to get away, I guess. “That was one of the highlights of the tour. And they said, ‘Please don’t fall off the boat when you get back on to go to the mainland.’ ”(In fact, there are almost never any man-eating sharks in the bay, only small bottom-feeders. But that didn’t stop the staff from having fun with visitors and trying to convince the convicts that sharks circled the island.)Another stop was the recreation yard, Hernan said.“They came out and met all the black prisoners,” Hernan said. “Father Scannell was with them.”Boldt remembered Russell and Jones speaking to the prisoners in the yard, though he couldn’t remember what they said. (Jones was not available to be interviewed for this story, and Russell declined comment.)After a tour of the hospital, Hernan met Russell and Jones at the entrance to the chow hall, known as “Times Square.”Hernan walked them down Broadway to the main gate, where that photo he instantly recognized was snapped, the one featuring Russell and Jones, separated by a smiling DeVincenzi, who was about 30. Scannell and Lt. Emil Rickner were also in the picture. Both have since died. In August, DeVincenzi, now 88, stood near the spot where the photo was taken, and he smiled as he recalled that day. He was born in San Francisco, grew up there, and had followed the USF team very closely.“I was very happy to meet them,” he said.He has an 8-by-12 copy of that picture in a scrapbook in his home in San Francisco’s Marina District, where he has lived since 1960, and where he’s working on a book, “Murders on Alcatraz.”Farmer said the only time he remembered the trip being discussed was years later when he visited Jones in San Diego one night when the hometown Clippers were playing the Jones-coached Celtics.After the game, they gathered for dinner at a piano bar and discussed the visit. Those at their table wanted to know more.About two decades ago, Boldt searched newspaper archives for stories but found none.“I thought that was kind of odd,” he said.He said Alcatraz came up during a reunion for players from the two title teams held about a decade ago in Napa Valley.“How come nobody ever wrote anything on Alcatraz?” Boldt asked Jones.“You know, I was always wondering about that, too,” Jones said.But their tour didn’t mark the end of basketball on Alcatraz. Only the beginning.\nIn the early 1960s, convicts at Alcatraz had a vote for a new sport in the recreation yard: basketball or baseball.Baseball was hugely popular. Future Hall of Fame slugger Stan Musial, following in the footsteps of the USF players, had visited the prison in 1960. And Warren Spahn, a fellow future Hall of Famer, stopped by, too.But basketball won out. A court was set up, concrete footings were poured (one is engraved with the date Aug. 10, 1961), and two goals were erected.Leigh Wiener, a Los Angeles-based photographer, captured the goals in some of his nearly 300 black-and-white pictures taken March 21, 1963, the day the prison closed. His son, Devik, rediscovered the photos, and several were on display in the old industry building, including a shot of a lonely basketball in a puddle near a wall.Another low-angle shot showed a single dumbbell and weightlifting plates strewn on one side of a chain-link fence; on the other, two basketball goals on opposite ends stand over an empty court.The goals were torn down during the on-site filming of the 1979 film “Escape from Alcatraz” starring Eastwood, because the filmmakers wanted to portray the convicts playing baseball in the yard.Today, there is little sign of basketball’s brief appearance at Alcatraz. A concrete footing remains near the pitcher’s mound on a small, dirt softball field, where four tattered white bases mark the edges.But basketball returned to Alcatraz nearly 50 years after the prison closed. In 2010, Red Bull held its inaugural King of The Rock Tournament in the yard, pitting 64 players from across the country against each other in a one-on-one, single-elimination, one-day event for a chance to win $10,000.The games were played on a half-court in the yard, with the cellhouse looming like a haunted castle. The cracked concrete became slick as a heavy fog rolled in, with the final game beginning around midnight.Watching over all of it was one of Red Bull’s sponsored athletes, a big name the company used to help drum up publicity for the event: Rajon Rondo, the Celtics’ All-Star point guard.For three years Rondo attended the event. He took photos, and viewed a few cells, including Capone’s. He learned the place’s history.This summer, while holding his basketball camp in his hometown of Louisville, Ky., Rondo was told by the Boston reporter about Russell, Jones, and their trip.“Those were the last people that were there?” Rondo asked. “And then me?”He sat stunned. He shook his head.“Wow, that’s crazy,” he said.\nAs inviting as the convicts were on that day nearly six decades ago, the USF players still knew they were in an infamous prison.“It was kind of weird to be walking along all these cells,” Farmer said. “And the cells weren’t that big” (the floor was 5 feet by 9 feet, about the size of a regulation pool table). “It was sobering. It got your attention. And you have to remember, too, this wasn’t too long after they had the Marines go out there.”A decade earlier, in 1946, six convicts overpowered officers, seized weapons, and took control of the prison during a violent escape attempt. Marines were called in during the two-day siege, which ultimately left two officers and three convicts dead and more than a dozen others injured. It became known as the “Battle of Alcatraz.”Although many of the prisoners had notorious pasts, Farmer said the players felt safe during their several hours on the island.“I think because we were athletes, when we came in, they had an interest in what we were doing more so than trying to do something — show off about themselves, or anything like that,” he said.“That’s the whole impression that I got out of that; these were not convicts, these were just sports fans.”One moment crystallized that notion.Before Hernan walked the star basketball players down Broadway, a black convict named William Brunson made a request.“Can you arrange for Bill to wave to me?” he asked.“OK, I’ll see what I can do,” Hernan said.Russell obliged. And in that moment, with that simple gesture, Brunson was no longer just a former military member serving a 15-year sentence for murder. He was no longer just prisoner AZ822. In the amber of that moment, he was just a fan.
The Boston Police Department on Sunday said that the man found dead after a five-alarm fire on Winthrop Street in Roxbury Friday night appears to have been the victim of a homicide.“The fire investigation is now a homicide investigation,” said Superintendent in Chief William G. Gross.\n\t\nThe victim, Santo Alcadio Bernabel, 69, of Hazelton, Pa., suffered multiple stab wounds, Boston police said Sunday night in a statement.Police are investigating whether there is a connection between the fire and a man who showed up at a Boston hospital with stab wounds, a law enforcement official with knowledge of the investigation said. The man, the official said, was wearing a GPS bracelet and police were able to trace it back to the vicinity of the fire.Jake Wark, spokesman for Suffolk District Attorney Daniel F. Conley, said investigators were still probing the cause and origin of the fire. \nSteve MacDonald, spokesman for the Boston Fire Department, said investigators are still trying to locate all the people who lived in the six-unit apartment building. The fire displaced at least two dozen residents. “They are the best eyewitnesses to what happened but to interview them you have to find them,” he said. “And their world has been turned upside down.”Many sought shelter with the Red Cross and others are staying with family or friends.“The investigators have to track them down to find out what they may have seen, heard, or smelled,” before the fire started, MacDonald said.Some who live nearby returned to the scene at 104 Winthrop St. on Sunday afternoon. The neighborhood was quiet, and many of the adjacent houses were boarded up or empty.  A small group of women snapped pictures on their iPhones and comforted one another. “We were all shaken,” Janice Kinz  said, referring to the local community. “I think we all just want to know what really happened.”
The plans for the long-stalled Madison Park High School in November 1966 were the grandest ever pitched for a Boston public school, startling city councilors during a presentation that made front-page news the next day.The campus-style high school in Roxbury — a neighborhood where educational opportunities had long been short-changed — would boast an Olympic-sized swimming pool, a television studio, and possibly a nightclub or coffeehouse for teenagers. There would be seven buildings total, including a venue inspired by the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts in New York City and a vocational-education center geared for students and adults alike. \n\t\n“This high school will be the salvation of the Boston school system,” city development director Edward J. Logue\n boldly predicted. “It will give Latin School a run for its money.”\n\nThose lofty aspirations would never come to be.Instead of delivering salvation to a school system battling racial inequality, Madison Park repeatedly emerged over the ensuing decades as a symbol of educational failure, bureaucratic neglect, and lingering racial tensions.Even the opening of the complex in 1977 — years behind schedule — brought mounting disappointment. Construction problems forced students to eat cold meals for six weeks. The swimming pool was unusable. A city fiscal crisis threatened plans to build the vocational center. The growing list of problems was “like a cancer eating at the school,” the head of the parent council told the Boston Herald in 1978.\nThe troubled history of Madison Park offers insight into why Boston has failed generations of its students who desire to learn a trade or technical skills — often to boost themselves out of a life of poverty — and why local employers have to tap out-of-state workers for jobs that otherwise could have gone to residents a few blocks away.It also raises questions, as Boston faces another urgent crisis to turn around Madison Park, about what it will take for the city to develop a top-notch vocational high school, like those that thrive in almost every corner of the state, or whether it is doomed to repeat the failures of its past.“Madison Park has tremendous potential if we could ever get it together,” said Michael Contompasis, a former Boston school superintendent, noting that Worcester has transformed its vocational school into a national model. “It’s a question of leadership, it’s a question of political will, and it’s a question of rethinking all the recommendations ever made.”Some educators and education advocates in the city question whether the problems facing Madison Park are surmountable, \nand believe Boston should consider starting \n\na new vocational school from scratch. The decades of disappointment, they say, have bred a deeply rooted culture of distrust and entrenched territorialism within the school and the neighborhood around it.Overhaul efforts through the years have often stalled or failed as teachers, community activists, and political leaders have clashed over philosophical differences in how to push the school forward, and debates over whether motives were fueled by the interest of students or personal or political agendas.Looming over these fights is a School Department that state and city leaders have criticized for valuing college preparatory programs over vocational education and for lacking a basic understanding of what it takes to train students for technical careers or the trades. That has led to ill-fated decisions, such as appointing headmasters without the appropriate expertise, and filling seats at Madison Park with students who have failing grades, disciplinary problems, and no interest in vocational education.\nYet every time state or city officials propose spinning off Madison Park from the city school system, allowing it to operate as an independent school system like nearly every other vocational school across the state, the School Department balks. Some teachers get nervous they will lose their jobs or protection under the Boston Teachers Union contract, and community activists protest, fearing such a move could prevent fewer Roxbury students from enrolling.Just this summer, an intervention team, appointed by Interim Superintendent John McDonough and the Boston Teachers Union to craft a set of remedies for Madison Park, recommended closing the school in three years and replacing it with a regional vocational school at another site if a turnaround fails. McDonough rejected the idea.“It is my belief and intent to focus on success rather than planning for failure,” McDonough said. But he acknowledged the challenges are immense, including developing a new culture and mindset at the school.“I think you have a lot of frustration among faculty and particularly the students who say that we keep promising stuff and not delivering,” McDonough said in an interview, vowing the School Department would do better. “We have an opportunity now to deliver. It does require changes, but it can be done.” \nAs school opened this fall, the situation at Madison Park could not have been more bleak. The school scrambled to hire nearly 60 teachers and administrators in August, and some positions remain unfilled. Many students and teachers went about a week without a legitimate class schedule, prompting students to demonstrate.Headmaster Diane Ross Gary, who took the reins just a year earlier, resigned a few days later, as a growing number of teachers, students, and parents called for her termination. The School Department had resisted firing her for months, and several black political leaders and community activists had lobbied Mayor Martin J. Walsh to keep her in the post, saying she deserved more time to prove herself.In the end, Gary, who had no prior experience as a headmaster, had failed to gain state certification to lead a school in Massachusetts.All of this occurred as Madison Park was supposed to be starting the third year of a turnaround effort that was pushed by then-mayor Thomas M. Menino, who promised in his 2012 State of the City address to transform the school into a critical job training center for students and adults alike.Each year of the turnaround has been marked by notable missteps. Scores on the Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System exams this spring dropped in each subject area. In science, for instance, just 3 percent of 10th-graders scored proficient, down from 25 percent who scored proficient or advanced the previous year. The school’s graduation rate of 63.6 percent, while largely improving, still remains more than 20 percentage points below the state average. “We have kids here who can’t read,” said one teacher who was not authorized to speak to the news media. “We have a huge problem with kids who can’t do fractions. To me that’s a real crisis.”The poor academic achievement, combined with student behavior problems, severely restricts the school’s ability to place students in apprenticeship programs, a key path to employment.Vocational education experts also say Madison Park is not establishing enough placements in small private businesses, which are more apt to hire students after graduation than large corporations or government agencies. The dismal record has Mitchell Chester, the state commissioner of elementary and secondary education, contemplating whether he should formally declare the school “underperforming,” a move that could set the stage for state receivership in three years absent a dramatic turnaround. A decision is expected in the coming weeks.\nBoston’s early problems with vocational education were rooted in racial inequities that prompted federal court intervention. White students typically attended high schools with more modern facilities than those used by black and Latino students at the crumbling Boston Trade High School in Mission Hill.\nUS District Judge W. Arthur Garrity Jr. embraced the Madison Park project, calling it the “keystone” of his plans in the 1970s to desegregate the public schools. A team of experts traveled across the country to develop the programming for what would be called the Humphrey Occupational Resource Center, which opened in 1980 at the Madison Park complex. Initially, the Humphrey Center taught students for a half-day from all the high schools across the city who wanted to learn a trade, and it operated separately from Madison Park High School, which at the time had a strong focus on music. States across the nation had successfully used half-day programs, but in Boston the arrangement would be short-lived. Confronted with declining enrollment at both the Humphrey Center and Madison Park, the School Committee voted in 1986 to merge the two amid budget-cutting. It also decided to give away a chunk of the complex, including the science building and later the music center, to a new exam school, now called the O’Bryant School of Math and Science.The merger did not go well. Within a few years, state education officials placed several vocational programs on probation.“It was a travesty of epic proportions,” said Judith Baker, who taught English at Madison Park from 1979 to 2005 and is now a member of the Friends of Madison Park. “The parents were right to be angry. Madison Park began to deteriorate as a technical school. The superintendent of schools didn’t believe in vocational education at all. We didn’t have any defenders.”\nTo this day, the repercussions of the merger resonate, contributing to an identity crisis that has lasted to this day over whether Madison Park is truly a citywide vocational high school or a neighborhood high school for Roxbury that happens to have vocational programs as electives, said Charles Lyons, the superintendent-director of Shawsheen Valley Technical High School in Billerica and a member of the Madison Park intervention team.He said the key to Madison Park’s future success is to sever it from the school system and have an independent board of experts run it.“The kids are worthy of a high-quality first-class technical education,” Lyons said. “Boston has the financial capability to provide it. The adults have to make it happen.”State education officials first raised the idea of independent oversight in the late 1980s, believing it was the only way to ensure Madison Park would get the appropriate attention. But the School Department resisted.Then-mayor Raymond Flynn, concerned that Boston was failing to prepare enough students for jobs on the Big Dig and other major projects, called for Madison Park to become an independent vocational school in his 1992 State of the City address. But the proposal sparked bitter protests from students, community activists, and disaffected faculty, who repeatedly spread false rumors that Flynn wanted to give away seats to suburbanites.\n\n\nA year later, students descended on City Hall to protest. Menino, who was preparing to become acting mayor because Flynn was departing to become ambassador to the Vatican, met with a few of the students. After they emerged from the meeting, other protesters pelted Menino with snowballs, even though he remained undecided about the proposal.The issue ultimately proved too toxic during a mayoral election year and it died.Madison Park slipped from the headlines, and with a skilled headmaster at the helm for a few years, the school enjoyed an academic reemergence. But that, too, would be short-lived, undermined by a succession of headmasters and then a laser-like focus on improving MCAS scores, sacrificing time in vocational education classes for test prep.Menino would not enter the fray of turning around Madison Park again until his 2012 speech, setting off a new round of acrimony.On the morning students protested last month — demanding their class schedules immediately — a handful of carpentry students, who had already been assigned some courses, were on the other side of Roxbury, pouring cement for the foundation of a single-family house they are helping to build.Madison Park teachers, administrators and supporters point to the activity on the job site that morning as evidence that good things are happening there. “The staff has worked very hard to make sure the school is moving forward and are trying to make sure the education is current and relevant and prepares them for the future,” said Al Holland, the school’s acting headmaster.\nOn a tour of the 900-student school one recent morning, the chaos of last month appeared to have subsided. Nicely painted hallways were quiet. Freshmen in one math class listened carefully to a lesson on solving algebraic equations; students in the electrical shop diligently wired light switches; and students donned chef caps as they sliced peaches for a cobbler.Teachers talked enthusiastically about their programs and grooming students for the workforce or college. Vincent Fanuele, a carpentry teacher, said one of his most important tasks is “to develop their character and their professional skills.” A group of seniors studying automotives said the school has helped them see the merits of going to college. Some talked of becoming engineers; others to get more advanced credentials to be mechanics.”This school has opened my eyes to so many things I never knew before,” said Jeffrey Ruiz, 17, of Dorchester.But Holland, who came out of retirement to help out the school temporarily, acknowledged that much work remains for the school to be what everyone dreams it could be.“The biggest challenge is to make sure we are working with one vision and one purpose,” he said, “and moving forward with excellence in everything we do.”\n\n\n\n\n
Baseball has a way of sewing the loose threads of history together and this October is no different. With the October spotlight cast upon the resurgent Kansas City Royals, who begin play in the American League Championship Series against the Baltimore Orioles on Friday, it’s also an opportunity to shine a light on another Kansas City, Mo., baseball revival. The Negro Leagues Baseball Museum was in dire straits with dwindling support and finances back in 2010, but under president Bob Kendrick, who took over in 2011, the museum has bounced back. It has had three straight profitable years and will celebrate its 25th anniversary next year, no small feat for a museum that at its inception was housed in one small office with former Negro Leagues players such as the legendary Buck O’Neil having to pay the rent. \n\t\nWhen the Patriots played the Kansas City Chiefs last month, I toured the 10,000-square-foot museum for three hours, learning about players familiar (Josh Gibson, Satchel Paige, and James “Cool Papa” Bell) and players unfamiliar (Moses Fleetwood Walker, Pittsfield’s own Frank Grant, and John Henry “Pop” Lloyd). It was both fascinating and infuriating to know such great talents had existed in a parallel universe to major league baseball history. It was heartening to see their stories preserved and disheartening to know that more major league teams and players weren’t contributing more to a national treasure of the national pastime.If half the attention was paid to the museum by big league players that was paid to Derek Jeter’s fond farewell tour, Kendrick’s task would be a lot easier. But it’s more fun to tweet out “Re2pect” and wear Jeter wristbands. Players, especially African-American and Latino ones, have to step up to the plate with financial support for the museum.“It’s all privately funded. It has been from Day 1,” said Kendrick. “You start looking at sports museums and Halls of Fame around the country, they’re all struggling. During that down period for us we were not an exception. We have done this on our own. We don’t have a major endowment. We don’t have a lot of big-name contributions. We have been in many ways, like those in the Negro Leagues, having to scratch and claw and find a way in order to create a stable environment. We now want to look at how we move this organization to the next 25 years.”Kendrick said there is a core group of players that has provided support. He said that Los Angeles Dodgers outfielder Matt Kemp has been very generous. Ichiro Suzuki contributed to the museum in honor of O’Neil. Jeter, CC Sabathia, Torii Hunter, Ryan Howard, Jimmy Rollins, and Curtis Granderson have all been involved. Kendrick said it’s actually easier to get the support of former players. Baseball Hall of Famers Ernie Banks, Joe Morgan, Lou Brock, and Dave Winfield are major contributors.The National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y., has 90 full-time employees. The Negro Leagues Baseball Museum has seven, according to Kendrick. The museum would like to hire more staff, but that takes money. Kendrick said it’s the museum’s job to connect current players with their Negro Leagues forebearers. He’s being magnanimous. It should be the job of the MLB Players Association to connect their membership’s resources to the museum. Raising funds and the museum’s profile became more difficult after O’Neil died on Oct. 6, 2006. O’Neil, a former Negro Leagues player, major league scout, and beloved baseball raconteur, was the museum’s patron saint and ambassador.The success of the Kansas City Royals, long among baseball’s downtrodden but back in the playoffs for the first time since Ronald Reagan was president and Madonna was blazing the charts, has been a boon for the museum. During the Royals’ push to make the playoffs for the first time since 1985, the museum, normally closed on Mondays, began opening seven days a week. Kendrick is hoping the national buzz from the ALCS will boost the museum’s profile.“There is no question that the Royals being in the playoffs has had a tremendous impact on our turnstiles,” said Kendrick. Under the Glass family’s stewardship, the Royals have frequently been cited as one of the more frugal clubs in baseball, but they’ve always been generous with their support for the Negro Leagues museum. Kendrick said that just this week, Royals pitcher Jeremy Guthrie brought guests to the museum.“The relationship with the Royals is really strong. They have been a great partner,” said Kendrick. “They have fully embraced what it represents and have an understanding and an appreciation of the roots of the league in this city, with the birth of the Negro Leagues here and the great Kansas City Monarchs teams. “The club has been a great voice in helping promote the museum. The Brewers, Padres, and Yankees have all been involved in supporting the museum financially for years. Our goal is to get all 30 clubs involved in supporting our museum.”(Kendrick said the Red Sox bring players every year, led by play-by-play announcer Joe Castiglione, whom Kendrick called a dear friend.)The museum doesn’t just want to be part of baseball’s past. Kendrick said the museum could play a role in addressing declining participation in baseball among African-Americans. Only 8.3 percent of big leaguers on 2014 Opening Day rosters were African American, \nIt was 125 years ago that Moses Fleetwood Walker, the first African-American to play in the major leagues and the last until Jackie Robinson, played in his final minor league game for the Syracuse Stars of the International League. A gentleman’s agreement pulled the curtain of segregation over major league baseball and its minor league affiliates until Robinson, a Kansas City Monarchs player, joined the Dodgers’ Triple A affiliate, the Montreal Royals, in 1946. No sport is more reverential with its history than baseball. Spotlighted by the Kansas City Royals’ renaissance, a piece of that history deserves baseball’s embrace.

The Brewers, Padres, and Yankees have all been involved in supporting the museum financially for years. Our goal is to get all 30 clubs involved in supporting our museum.”(Kendrick said the Red Sox bring players every year, led by play-by-play announcer Joe Castiglione, whom Kendrick called a dear friend.)The museum doesn’t just want to be part of baseball’s past. Kendrick said the museum could play a role in addressing declining participation in baseball among African-Americans. Only 8.3 percent of big leaguers on 2014 Opening Day rosters were African American, \nIt was 125 years ago that Moses Fleetwood Walker, the first African-American to play in the major leagues and the last until Jackie Robinson, played in his final minor league game for the Syracuse Stars of the International League. A gentleman’s agreement pulled the curtain of segregation over major league baseball and its minor league affiliates until Robinson, a Kansas City Monarchs player, joined the Dodgers’ Triple A affiliate, the Montreal Royals, in 1946. No sport is more reverential with its history than baseball. Spotlighted by the Kansas City Royals’ renaissance, a piece of that history deserves baseball’s embrace. 
\n of Uniontown, Ohio, is the mother of an adorable 2-year-old girl named Payton, whom she and her partner call a “dream come true” and love with all their heart. “She’s made us the people that we are,” Cramblett says. “Never trade it for the world.”If that’s the case, Payton will doubtless wonder, once she’s old enough to Google her own name, why did Cramblett  that enabled her to get pregnant with her wonderful daughter? Why did she demand tens of thousands of dollars as compensation for breach of warranty and for what the lawsuit calls Payton’s “wrongful birth?” \n\t\nThe answer, Cramblett and her lawyers  in televised interviews, has nothing to do with Payton, and everything to do with punishing the sperm bank for a careless mix-up: It supplied vials of sperm from Donor No. 330, when Cramblett had selected Donor No. 380. When Cramblett tried to untangle the matter with the sperm bank, she says, the receptionist was rude and hung up on her. “I am happy that I have a healthy child,” Cramblett . “But I’m not going to let them get away with not being held accountable.” But Cramblett’s suit against Midwest Sperm Bank hasn’t become a cause célèbre because of a customer service issue. It ignited a furor because of race. Cramblett was inseminated with the sperm of a black man, instead of the blonde-haired, blue-eyed white man she and her partner had picked from the sperm bank’s catalogue of donors. Which means that Payton is biracial — or to use Cramblett’s phrase, “obviously mixed race.” Hence the lawsuit, and the demand for at least $50,000 in damages. After all, the Ohio couple wasn’t expecting to have to raise a child with skin darker than theirs.Did somebody say racist? No, no, no, Cramblett insists, this isn’t about race at all. “For people to think I don’t want this child because of her skin tone is just not the case,” . And when Payton is older, she’ll understand that “the lawsuit was about a company that had to make changes and give us compensation so that we can go through counseling and learn how to love each other even more.”Sure she will. Because parents who adore their children as a “dream come true” and wouldn’t trade them “for the world” always file wrongful-birth lawsuits. Don’t they?It’s hard to decide which is more surreal — the race-obsessed complaint Cramblett , or her after-the-fact pretense that she isn’t making an issue of her daughter’s race. Cramblett wants to be paid handsomely for the “personal injuries, medical expense, pain, suffering, emotional distress, and other economic and non-economic losses” caused by Payton’s birth. Those hardships include having white relatives who can be “unconsciously insensitive,” and Cramblett’s “anxiety” at the prospect of enrolling her daughter in an all-white school. Uniontown — the Akron suburb to which Cramblett relocated with her partner for its good schools — she now regards as “too racially intolerant.” That’s not all that Cramblett has found “stressful” about motherhood. “Payton has hair typical of an African American girl,” the lawsuit notes. “To get a decent cut, Jennifer must travel to a black neighborhood, far from where she lives, where she is obviously different in appearance, and not overtly welcome.” Well. If that doesn’t merit a wrongful-birth lawsuit, what does?Poor Payton. One day she’ll read the court documents in this case and realize that her mother saw racism everywhere she looked, when the only person flipping out about giving birth to a biracial daughter was Payton’s mother herself. When the sperm bank receptionist asked Cramblett whether she had selected an African-American donor, the Ohio woman snapped: “No, why would I request that? My partner and I are Caucasian.” When she learned that her sperm donor wasn’t white after all, she admits, she was filled with “anger, disappointment, and fear.”Midwest Sperm Bank acknowledges its blunder, and it ought to face some legal repercussion for its sloppy record-keeping. But Cramblett could have gotten pregnant by Donor No. 380 and still ended up with a daughter very different from what she expected. Payton could have been born with Down syndrome or deafness; she could have had cystic fibrosis or a congenital heart defect. Then whom would her mother be targeting in a lawsuit? Having a baby isn’t like ordering a pair of jeans — . Anyone who thinks they are entitled to exactly the child they envisioned — and are prepared to fly to court if they don’t get it — isn’t fit to be a parent. The world is full of people whose conception was in some way unplanned or unexpected. That doesn’t make their births wrongful or a reason to play the race card. For Payton’s sake, let’s hope her mother figures that out, and soon.
Primary care physicians should screen all adults over age 45 for diabetes, according to  proposed last Monday by a government-sponsored panel of experts. The US Preventive Services Task Force, composed of primary care providers, bases its new advice on evidence suggesting that diagnosing elevated blood sugar levels before people develop full-blown diabetes can reduce their risk of getting the condition and also developing heart disease.Evidence from several recent large clinical trials suggests that those who have moderately elevated blood sugar, a condition called prediabetes, detected on a routine blood test and treated through a diet and exercise program have a 47\u2009percent reduced risk of developing diabetes over the next several years.\n\t\nThe Task Force’s previous recommendations from 2008 advised diabetes screening only for those with increased heart disease risk due to high blood pressure because studies were lacking to show benefits for screening the general population. “More evidence has emerged since then on the benefits of lifestyle interventions,” said Task Force member Dr. Michael Pignone, a professor of medicine at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Medicine. “Our feeling is that you need to have an effective intervention available for people that you screen.”People who are overweight, have a family history of diabetes, or are African-American, Asian, or Latino likely need to be screened earlier than 45, the Task Force recommended, because they’re at higher diabetes risk. Women who have polycystic ovary syndrome or who developed gestational diabetes during pregnancy also fall into the high-risk category.“We didn’t specify an age for screening those high-risk groups,” Pignone said. “That’s something patients should discuss with their doctors.” The group also didn’t advise how frequently adults should be screened. Diabetes experts supported the new recommendations, which agree with the latest advice from  other medical organizations. Both the American Diabetes Association and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention urge doctors to consider performing screening every three years in adults age 45 and older, especially for those who are overweight. Screening tests include a blood glucose test which requires fasting for eight hours beforehand, a glucose tolerance test which checks blood sugar both before and after drinking a sweetened beverage, or a blood test to measure the marker hemoglobin A1C, which measures average blood glucose for the past two to three months.  About 86\u2009million American adults have elevated blood sugar levels, and an additional 29\u2009million have diabetes, which is up from 26\u2009million in 2010. But more than one-quarter of those with diabetes are unaware that they have the condition because they don’t recognize the symptoms, like frequent urination, weight loss, and fatigue, and aren’t getting screened, according to a . Dr. Osama Hamdy, medical director of the obesity clinical program at Joslin Diabetes Center, said the Task Force’s guidelines, aimed at primary care physicians, will likely lead not just to earlier diabetes diagnoses but to a greater detection of high blood sugar levels at a point when diabetes can still be prevented.“We need to focus on prevention rather than just treating a problem,” Hamdy said. Doctors, however, need to do more in terms of prevention than simply telling patients to quit junk food and soda and increase their physical activity, Pignone said. “The type of prevention program found to be effective in studies we reviewed typically involved 16 educational sessions, access to a health coach, and achievement of 150 minutes of activity each week,” he said. “Primary care practices don’t usually have the resources” to get patients to make drastic lifestyle changes.  Most of the lifestyle intervention programs offered at Joslin, Hamdy said, are only covered by insurance companies once a patient has been diagnosed with diabetes — not for prevention.“I hope this new recommendation will set the stage for reimbursements at an earlier stage when diabetes can be prevented,” he added.In the meantime, the CDC offers a National Diabetes Prevention program that teaches nutrition and exercise classes at more than a  at little or no cost to participants. \n\n
Boston Police Superintendent in Chief  William Gross stood in the middle of Franklin Field surrounded by Pop Warner football players who barely reached his waist, even with helmets on.Beaming, he tossed the coin high to see who would have the ball first — the Boston Raiders or the visitors from Manchester, Conn.\n\t\nThe coin toss was an honor the Raiders team had decided to bestow weeks ago, when the 50-year-old police officer agreed to sponsor five players whose families could not afford the $175 fee to play. But in the aftermath of a scathing report by the ACLU that accused the department of disproportionately stopping black and Latino people, team leaders wanted to remind city residents of the help police have given the Raiders. The team’s 140 players, ages 7 to 14, are primarily African-American.“We love you and we support you,” Donnell Singleton, president of Boston Raiders Inc., called out from a microphone to Gross, the department’s first African-American superintendent in chief. On the sidelines, the crowd cheered.The study by the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts said that police officers in the city disproportionately observed, interrogated, or searched black residents from 2007 to 2010. The study was released Wednesday.Blacks were 8.8 percent more likely than whites to be stopped repeatedly by police, and 12 percent more likely than whites to be frisked or searched during a stop, according to the study, which took into account factors such as criminal history. The report infuriated some police officials, who said the data were outdated and failed to note steps the department has taken in the past four years to train officers on addressing their biases.Singleton said he wanted residents in Franklin Field, where the Raiders play home games, to remember the financial support the department has lent the team over the years. This year, the Boston Police Athletic League also donated $2,500 toward the team’s travel costs.Singleton pointed to the low-rise, brick housing complex abutting Franklin Field, where police have had to respond to shootings.“What better place to say to our residents, the police are not against us, they’re with us,” he said.Gross, who played for the Boston Raiders in 1975 when he was 12 years old, said few city residents have approached him about the report, which he dismissed as the work of lawyers out of touch with community and religious leaders.“I’m not even thinking about the ACLU,” Gross said. “I don’t listen to people who quote from books and numbers but don’t walk the street.”Gary Adams, a retired police officer who is now the department’s chaplain, agreed.“We’re not saying that we have a perfect police department, that we don’t have profiling,” he said. “We’re more mindful of that now, far more than we’ve ever been.”Nearby was Pastor Donald Osgood, who runs GateWay Ministries in Dorchester. He has raised five sons in the city, including a 9-year-old and 11-year-old who play for the team.Osgood said he has always told his sons that the best way to avoid problems with police is to be respectful and say hello when they make eye contact with officers. “I told them the way to navigate the streets is to not be in the streets,” he said. But 15-year-old Andrew Marshall, who lives in Franklin Field, said he has friends with no gang ties who complain police often approach them when they are hanging out in the tougher parts of the city. Police ask their names, where they are from, and what they are doing there, Marshall said, questions that leave his friends feeling uncomfortable and even harassed.“I understand how police have to take their precautions,” he said. “But sometimes things just aren’t what they seem. Sometimes, they’re just hanging out in the neighborhood.”\n
\n inaugural address in 2010, former Boston Mayor Thomas Menino envisioned a new Boston teeming with young techies working in industry clusters and living in semi-communal housing — Geekville, you might say. But the elderly, it turns out, are the fastest growing demographic group in Boston, according to a major housing report released this week by Boston Mayor Martin Walsh. Geezerville may turn out to be a more accurate moniker for Boston in the near future.By 2030, according to the report, the city’s senior set will increase by 22,400 households. People of retirement age will account for one in five Boston households. And \nthe bulk of new retirees will toss aside the Florida condo brochures and choose to “age in place.” \n\t\nIt’s great that seniors feel so comfortable here. But this is a potential housing nightmare for middle-income families who are already having trouble gaining a foothold in Boston. Increasingly, they will find themselves squeezed on one side by seniors who occupy large homes and on the other side by 20,000 undergraduates who drive up rents by sharing off-campus apartments. The middle class in this city can’t buy a break.And to get one, they’ll have to depend on courage that they haven’t yet seen from Mayor Walsh.Walsh’s administration understands the problem. The city’s population is on track to exceed 700,000 for the first time since the 1950s, according to the study. But unlike in those simpler times, Boston in 2030 won’t be chock-a-block with families of eight living in three-bedroom apartments. With fewer people inhabiting each unit, the pressure on the housing stock will grow even greater.To cope, the administration has set the goal of . In the introduction to the 131-page report, “Housing a Changing City: Boston 2030,” Walsh unambiguously accepts the challenge of putting the new housing plan into action. That’s huge. Until now, no one in the city could figure out where the mayor actually stood on housing. He clearly understands the wisdom of building higher, denser housing developments, especially along public transit lines. And his many friends in the building trades are urging him forward. Yet Walsh seems to freeze when confronted by NIMBY-minded residents who reflexively oppose any new construction.Last spring, Walsh became nervous about the height of a modest, 13-unit condo project proposed for a lot across the street from the Savin Hill T station. It’s all of three stories. Now, the developer is on the verge of giving up after enduring the inescapable “community process.” For months, Walsh was eerily quiet on a sensible proposal to build a 27-unit apartment building adjacent to the Fairmount commuter rail station in Hyde Park. Neighbors want to kill that development, too. But it is slowly and painfully winding its way through the approval process now that the mayor seems slightly more comfortable with the site. At this pace, the 53,000 units of new housing will take forever. And again, it is the middle class that will suffer most.The high cost of land and labor here practically forces developers to build luxury units or tap into government funds available for the construction of subsidized housing for the poor. Meanwhile, families earning a respectable income of $80,000 can only afford the bottom quarter of the homeownership market in Boston. And while there are a lot of new apartments in the pipeline, they are likely to rent for upwards of $3,500.The Walsh administration’s housing plan provides good data, detailed projections, and smart analysis. And it offers strategies to solve the problem: zoning relief in locations with good access to transit; temporary relief from property taxes in special middle-income development areas; market incentives to develop 3,500 new units of senior housing as a way for the elderly to downsize; and the creation of 16,000 new undergraduate dorm beds along with off-campus student villages.But how willing is Walsh to fight this battle? If the mayor is serious, we should soon see him blasting through the NIMBY barricades and convincing his buddies in the building trades to bring down construction costs on homes for middle class families earning in the $50,000 to $100,000 range. Walsh needs to shout his support for an aggressive housing policy from Boston’s rooftops. No more padding softly around the living room. 
The plans for the long-stalled Madison Park High School in November 1966 were the grandest ever pitched for a Boston public school, startling city councilors during a presentation that made front-page news the next day.The campus-style high school in Roxbury — a neighborhood where educational opportunities had long been short-changed — would boast an Olympic-sized swimming pool, a television studio, and possibly a nightclub or coffeehouse for teenagers. There would be seven buildings total, including a venue inspired by the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts in New York City and a vocational-education center geared for students and adults alike. \n\t\n“This high school will be the salvation of the Boston school system,” city development director Edward J. Logue\n boldly predicted. “It will give Latin School a run for its money.”\n\nThose lofty aspirations would never come to be.Instead of delivering salvation to a school system battling racial inequality, Madison Park repeatedly emerged over the ensuing decades as a symbol of educational failure, bureaucratic neglect, and lingering racial tensions.Even the opening of the complex in 1977 — years behind schedule — brought mounting disappointment. Construction problems forced students to eat cold meals for six weeks. The swimming pool was unusable. A city fiscal crisis threatened plans to build the vocational center. The growing list of problems was “like a cancer eating at the school,” the head of the parent council told the Boston Herald in 1978.\nThe troubled history of Madison Park offers insight into why Boston has failed generations of its students who desire to learn a trade or technical skills — often to boost themselves out of a life of poverty — and why local employers have to tap out-of-state workers for jobs that otherwise could have gone to residents a few blocks away.It also raises questions, as Boston faces another urgent crisis to turn around Madison Park, about what it will take for the city to develop a top-notch vocational high school, like those that thrive in almost every corner of the state, or whether it is doomed to repeat the failures of its past.“Madison Park has tremendous potential if we could ever get it together,” said Michael Contompasis, a former Boston school superintendent, noting that Worcester has transformed its vocational school into a national model. “It’s a question of leadership, it’s a question of political will, and it’s a question of rethinking all the recommendations ever made.”Some educators and education advocates in the city question whether the problems facing Madison Park are surmountable, \nand believe Boston should consider starting \n\na new vocational school from scratch. The decades of disappointment, they say, have bred a deeply rooted culture of distrust and entrenched territorialism within the school and the neighborhood around it.Overhaul efforts through the years have often stalled or failed as teachers, community activists, and political leaders have clashed over philosophical differences in how to push the school forward, and debates over whether motives were fueled by the interest of students or personal or political agendas.Looming over these fights is a School Department that state and city leaders have criticized for valuing college preparatory programs over vocational education and for lacking a basic understanding of what it takes to train students for technical careers or the trades. That has led to ill-fated decisions, such as appointing headmasters without the appropriate expertise, and filling seats at Madison Park with students who have failing grades, disciplinary problems, and no interest in vocational education.\nYet every time state or city officials propose spinning off Madison Park from the city school system, allowing it to operate as an independent school system like nearly every other vocational school across the state, the School Department balks. Some teachers get nervous they will lose their jobs or protection under the Boston Teachers Union contract, and community activists protest, fearing such a move could prevent fewer Roxbury students from enrolling.Just this summer, an intervention team, appointed by Interim Superintendent John McDonough and the Boston Teachers Union to craft a set of remedies for Madison Park, recommended closing the school in three years and replacing it with a regional vocational school at another site if a turnaround fails. McDonough rejected the idea.“It is my belief and intent to focus on success rather than planning for failure,” McDonough said. But he acknowledged the challenges are immense, including developing a new culture and mindset at the school.“I think you have a lot of frustration among faculty and particularly the students who say that we keep promising stuff and not delivering,” McDonough said in an interview, vowing the School Department would do better. “We have an opportunity now to deliver. It does require changes, but it can be done.” \nAs school opened this fall, the situation at Madison Park could not have been more bleak. The school scrambled to hire nearly 60 teachers and administrators in August, and some positions remain unfilled. Many students and teachers went about a week without a legitimate class schedule, prompting students to demonstrate.Headmaster Diane Ross Gary, who took the reins just a year earlier, resigned a few days later, as a growing number of teachers, students, and parents called for her termination. The School Department had resisted firing her for months, and several black political leaders and community activists had lobbied Mayor Martin J. Walsh to keep her in the post, saying she deserved more time to prove herself.In the end, Gary, who had no prior experience as a headmaster, had failed to gain state certification to lead a school in Massachusetts.All of this occurred as Madison Park was supposed to be starting the third year of a turnaround effort that was pushed by then-mayor Thomas M. Menino, who promised in his 2012 State of the City address to transform the school into a critical job training center for students and adults alike.Each year of the turnaround has been marked by notable missteps. Scores on the Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System exams this spring dropped in each subject area. In science, for instance, just 3 percent of 10th-graders scored proficient, down from 25 percent who scored proficient or advanced the previous year. The school’s graduation rate of 63.6 percent, while largely improving, still remains more than 20 percentage points below the state average. “We have kids here who can’t read,” said one teacher who was not authorized to speak to the news media. “We have a huge problem with kids who can’t do fractions. To me that’s a real crisis.”The poor academic achievement, combined with student behavior problems, severely restricts the school’s ability to place students in apprenticeship programs, a key path to employment.Vocational education experts also say Madison Park is not establishing enough placements in small private businesses, which are more apt to hire students after graduation than large corporations or government agencies. The dismal record has Mitchell Chester, the state commissioner of elementary and secondary education, contemplating whether he should formally declare the school “underperforming,” a move that could set the stage for state receivership in three years absent a dramatic turnaround. A decision is expected in the coming weeks.\nBoston’s early problems with vocational education were rooted in racial inequities that prompted federal court intervention. White students typically attended high schools with more modern facilities than those used by black and Latino students at the crumbling Boston Trade High School in Mission Hill.\nUS District Judge W. Arthur Garrity Jr. embraced the Madison Park project, calling it the “keystone” of his plans in the 1970s to desegregate the public schools. A team of experts traveled across the country to develop the programming for what would be called the Humphrey Occupational Resource Center, which opened in 1980 at the Madison Park complex. Initially, the Humphrey Center taught students for a half-day from all the high schools across the city who wanted to learn a trade, and it operated separately from Madison Park High School, which at the time had a strong focus on music. States across the nation had successfully used half-day programs, but in Boston the arrangement would be short-lived. Confronted with declining enrollment at both the Humphrey Center and Madison Park, the School Committee voted in 1986 to merge the two amid budget-cutting. It also decided to give away a chunk of the complex, including the science building and later the music center, to a new exam school, now called the O’Bryant School of Math and Science.The merger did not go well. Within a few years, state education officials placed several vocational programs on probation.“It was a travesty of epic proportions,” said Judith Baker, who taught English at Madison Park from 1979 to 2005 and is now a member of the Friends of Madison Park. “The parents were right to be angry. Madison Park began to deteriorate as a technical school. The superintendent of schools didn’t believe in vocational education at all. We didn’t have any defenders.”\nTo this day, the repercussions of the merger resonate, contributing to an identity crisis that has lasted to this day over whether Madison Park is truly a citywide vocational high school or a neighborhood high school for Roxbury that happens to have vocational programs as electives, said Charles Lyons, the superintendent-director of Shawsheen Valley Technical High School in Billerica and a member of the Madison Park intervention team.He said the key to Madison Park’s future success is to sever it from the school system and have an independent board of experts run it.“The kids are worthy of a high-quality first-class technical education,” Lyons said. “Boston has the financial capability to provide it. The adults have to make it happen.”State education officials first raised the idea of independent oversight in the late 1980s, believing it was the only way to ensure Madison Park would get the appropriate attention. But the School Department resisted.Then-mayor Raymond Flynn, concerned that Boston was failing to prepare enough students for jobs on the Big Dig and other major projects, called for Madison Park to become an independent vocational school in his 1992 State of the City address. But the proposal sparked bitter protests from students, community activists, and disaffected faculty, who repeatedly spread false rumors that Flynn wanted to give away seats to suburbanites.\n\n\nA year later, students descended on City Hall to protest. Menino, who was preparing to become acting mayor because Flynn was departing to become ambassador to the Vatican, met with a few of the students. After they emerged from the meeting, other protesters pelted Menino with snowballs, even though he remained undecided about the proposal.The issue ultimately proved too toxic during a mayoral election year and it died.Madison Park slipped from the headlines, and with a skilled headmaster at the helm for a few years, the school enjoyed an academic reemergence. But that, too, would be short-lived, undermined by a succession of headmasters and then a laser-like focus on improving MCAS scores, sacrificing time in vocational education classes for test prep.Menino would not enter the fray of turning around Madison Park again until his 2012 speech, setting off a new round of acrimony.On the morning students protested last month — demanding their class schedules immediately — a handful of carpentry students, who had already been assigned some courses, were on the other side of Roxbury, pouring cement for the foundation of a single-family house they are helping to build.Madison Park teachers, administrators and supporters point to the activity on the job site that morning as evidence that good things are happening there. “The staff has worked very hard to make sure the school is moving forward and are trying to make sure the education is current and relevant and prepares them for the future,” said Al Holland, the school’s acting headmaster.\nOn a tour of the 900-student school one recent morning, the chaos of last month appeared to have subsided. Nicely painted hallways were quiet. Freshmen in one math class listened carefully to a lesson on solving algebraic equations; students in the electrical shop diligently wired light switches; and students donned chef caps as they sliced peaches for a cobbler.Teachers talked enthusiastically about their programs and grooming students for the workforce or college. Vincent Fanuele, a carpentry teacher, said one of his most important tasks is “to develop their character and their professional skills.” A group of seniors studying automotives said the school has helped them see the merits of going to college. Some talked of becoming engineers; others to get more advanced credentials to be mechanics.”This school has opened my eyes to so many things I never knew before,” said Jeffrey Ruiz, 17, of Dorchester.But Holland, who came out of retirement to help out the school temporarily, acknowledged that much work remains for the school to be what everyone dreams it could be.“The biggest challenge is to make sure we are working with one vision and one purpose,” he said, “and moving forward with excellence in everything we do.”\n\n\n\n\n
BRAINTREE — Massachusetts had its first Ebola scare Sunday as dozens of workers and patients were quarantined for hours at a Braintree medical facility, but by late evening fears that a man had been infected with the deadly virus appeared unfounded.Doctors at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston concluded that the man, who recently visited Liberia and was complaining of a headache and body aches, “does not appear to meet CDC criteria to be considered someone at high risk for Ebola, and the likelihood of Ebola virus disease is extremely low,” according to a statement from the hospital.\n\t\nOfficials did not elaborate on the criteria. Hospital officials said the patient will remain in isolation as monitoring continues.The man, whom officials have not identified, was taken by ambulance to Beth Israel from Braintree’s Harvard Vanguard office, where his symptoms and travel history had prompted clinic staffers to muster a hazardous materials team, alarming patients as unofficial word of an Ebola case spread. People were prevented from entering and leaving the facility for several hours.As events unfolded, Boston officials conferred with hospital and public health representatives, staying “in constant contact.\xa0.\xa0. as news of an Ebola scare began to break,” according to a statement late Sunday by Mayor Martin J. Walsh. “Today’s efforts reinforced my belief that the city is more than prepared to deal with any scenario like this,” Walsh said.At Beth Israel Deaconess, the patient was placed within a protective barrier, and isolated from the rest of the facility, said Dr. Kenneth Sands, senior vice president of the hospital’s department of health care and quality. The hospital had a standing team trained to deal with the virus, he said.The hospital said that “all precautions continue to be taken to ensure the safety of our patients, their families and our staff.”The Boston Public Health Commission also released a statement Sunday night saying that the man did not meet criteria to be considered at high risk for Ebola but that the commission would continue to monitor the situation.Sunday’s incident did not mark the first time Massachusetts officials have responded to concerns about the possibility of an Ebola case, although it was the most public to date. In recent months the state Department of Public Health has worked with local hospitals to investigate other suspected cases of Ebola, and all had quickly been ruled out, according to officials.“There are no confirmed cases of Ebola in Massachusetts,” health officials assured in a statement.Worldwide, there have been more than 4,000 confirmed, probable, or suspected Ebola deaths in recent months, almost all of them in the West African countries of Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nSo far only one person in the United States has died from Ebola: Thomas Eric Duncan died in Dallas on Oct. 8, 18 days after returning from a trip to Liberia. American video journalist Ashoka Mukpo, of Providence, became infected while working as a freelance camera operator in Liberia. He is being treated at Nebraska Medical Center and has shown modest improvements.\nSunday’s scare began in the early afternoon, after the man described his symptoms to health staff at the Braintree clinic. “Out of an abundance of caution we immediately notified authorities, and the patient was securely removed from the building and put into an ambulance,” said Benjamin Kruskal, chief of infectious disease for the practice, in a statement.The appearance of a hazmat team alarmed patients and workers in the Braintree medical offices.Denise DiMarzio, who is seven months pregnant, was in a waiting room with her mother, Maureen, for a lunchtime appointment when they noticed people in the building wearing hazmat gear, they said.Staff at the medical office took patients into examining rooms and explained that there was an emergency, they said, but did not explain the nature of the situation, which alarmed Denise DiMarzio, 35.\n“I was like, ‘I’m kind of afraid for my health. Is it something that I could catch or my baby could contract?’.\xa0.\xa0. And they couldn’t answer us,” she said.Denise DiMarzio, a nurse from Rockland, said the thought of crossing paths with a man possibly infected with Ebola was frightening. “I know it’s not airborne, but the fact that it’s bodily fluids — I mean I don’t know if he was coughing and had secretions on his hands and he was in the same waiting room as I was. It makes me a little bit nervous,” she said.Maureen DiMarzio, of Weymouth, said that after her daughter went into the examining room, she went outside to her car and spoke with a woman who said, “Did you just come out of there? There’s someone in there with Ebola.”Maureen DiMarzio said she then called her daughter and told her to leave the building immediately and not touch anything, and she advised others not to go inside. Denise DiMarzio left the building, but police would not allow the women to leave the parking lot until 4:30 p.m.\n\nDenise DiMarzio said she believed police held the people who had been inside because they did not know if they would require decontamination.Outside the Harvard Vanguard offices Sunday afternoon, police cruisers, fire trucks, and ambulances lined Grossman Drive, and the parking lot was cordoned off by yellow police tape. “Ebola protocol is in place,” said Joe Zanca of the Braintree Fire Department. “We don’t know if he actually has Ebola.”Public safety officials clustered near the parking lot entry, where an ambulance sat. Five minutes before 4 p.m., the ambulance left the facility, headed south on Grossman Drive.Brewster Ambulance Service said in a statement that it received a call from the Harvard Vanguard facility about 1:20 p.m. Sunday and dispatched a response team of two ambulances.The team arrived to find the man waiting in his vehicle, as he had been instructed to do, and put him into an ambulance with its interior sealed with impermeable plastic sheeting, according to the statement. That ambulance will be decontaminated before it is returned to service, the statement said.At about 5 p.m. a tow truck removed the man’s black Toyota 4Runner SUV, with orange biohazard warning stickers on each of its windows, from the Harvard Vanguard parking lot.\n\n\n\n• \n• \n\n
\n of Uniontown, Ohio, is the mother of an adorable 2-year-old girl named Payton, whom she and her partner call a “dream come true” and love with all their heart. “She’s made us the people that we are,” Cramblett says. “Never trade it for the world.”If that’s the case, Payton will doubtless wonder, once she’s old enough to Google her own name, why did Cramblett  that enabled her to get pregnant with her wonderful daughter? Why did she demand tens of thousands of dollars as compensation for breach of warranty and for what the lawsuit calls Payton’s “wrongful birth?” \n\t\nThe answer, Cramblett and her lawyers  in televised interviews, has nothing to do with Payton, and everything to do with punishing the sperm bank for a careless mix-up: It supplied vials of sperm from Donor No. 330, when Cramblett had selected Donor No. 380. When Cramblett tried to untangle the matter with the sperm bank, she says, the receptionist was rude and hung up on her. “I am happy that I have a healthy child,” Cramblett . “But I’m not going to let them get away with not being held accountable.” But Cramblett’s suit against Midwest Sperm Bank hasn’t become a cause célèbre because of a customer service issue. It ignited a furor because of race. Cramblett was inseminated with the sperm of a black man, instead of the blonde-haired, blue-eyed white man she and her partner had picked from the sperm bank’s catalogue of donors. Which means that Payton is biracial — or to use Cramblett’s phrase, “obviously mixed race.” Hence the lawsuit, and the demand for at least $50,000 in damages. After all, the Ohio couple wasn’t expecting to have to raise a child with skin darker than theirs.Did somebody say racist? No, no, no, Cramblett insists, this isn’t about race at all. “For people to think I don’t want this child because of her skin tone is just not the case,” . And when Payton is older, she’ll understand that “the lawsuit was about a company that had to make changes and give us compensation so that we can go through counseling and learn how to love each other even more.”Sure she will. Because parents who adore their children as a “dream come true” and wouldn’t trade them “for the world” always file wrongful-birth lawsuits. Don’t they?It’s hard to decide which is more surreal — the race-obsessed complaint Cramblett , or her after-the-fact pretense that she isn’t making an issue of her daughter’s race. Cramblett wants to be paid handsomely for the “personal injuries, medical expense, pain, suffering, emotional distress, and other economic and non-economic losses” caused by Payton’s birth. Those hardships include having white relatives who can be “unconsciously insensitive,” and Cramblett’s “anxiety” at the prospect of enrolling her daughter in an all-white school. Uniontown — the Akron suburb to which Cramblett relocated with her partner for its good schools — she now regards as “too racially intolerant.” That’s not all that Cramblett has found “stressful” about motherhood. “Payton has hair typical of an African American girl,” the lawsuit notes. “To get a decent cut, Jennifer must travel to a black neighborhood, far from where she lives, where she is obviously different in appearance, and not overtly welcome.” Well. If that doesn’t merit a wrongful-birth lawsuit, what does?Poor Payton. One day she’ll read the court documents in this case and realize that her mother saw racism everywhere she looked, when the only person flipping out about giving birth to a biracial daughter was Payton’s mother herself. When the sperm bank receptionist asked Cramblett whether she had selected an African-American donor, the Ohio woman snapped: “No, why would I request that? My partner and I are Caucasian.” When she learned that her sperm donor wasn’t white after all, she admits, she was filled with “anger, disappointment, and fear.”Midwest Sperm Bank acknowledges its blunder, and it ought to face some legal repercussion for its sloppy record-keeping. But Cramblett could have gotten pregnant by Donor No. 380 and still ended up with a daughter very different from what she expected. Payton could have been born with Down syndrome or deafness; she could have had cystic fibrosis or a congenital heart defect. Then whom would her mother be targeting in a lawsuit? Having a baby isn’t like ordering a pair of jeans — . Anyone who thinks they are entitled to exactly the child they envisioned — and are prepared to fly to court if they don’t get it — isn’t fit to be a parent. The world is full of people whose conception was in some way unplanned or unexpected. That doesn’t make their births wrongful or a reason to play the race card. For Payton’s sake, let’s hope her mother figures that out, and soon.
The plans for the long-stalled Madison Park High School in November 1966 were the grandest ever pitched for a Boston public school, startling city councilors during a presentation that made front-page news the next day.The campus-style high school in Roxbury — a neighborhood where educational opportunities had long been short-changed — would boast an Olympic-sized swimming pool, a television studio, and possibly a nightclub or coffeehouse for teenagers. There would be seven buildings total, including a venue inspired by the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts in New York City and a vocational-education center geared for students and adults alike. \n\t\n“This high school will be the salvation of the Boston school system,” city development director Edward J. Logue\n boldly predicted. “It will give Latin School a run for its money.”\n\nThose lofty aspirations would never come to be.Instead of delivering salvation to a school system battling racial inequality, Madison Park repeatedly emerged over the ensuing decades as a symbol of educational failure, bureaucratic neglect, and lingering racial tensions.Even the opening of the complex in 1977 — years behind schedule — brought mounting disappointment. Construction problems forced students to eat cold meals for six weeks. The swimming pool was unusable. A city fiscal crisis threatened plans to build the vocational center. The growing list of problems was “like a cancer eating at the school,” the head of the parent council told the Boston Herald in 1978.\nThe troubled history of Madison Park offers insight into why Boston has failed generations of its students who desire to learn a trade or technical skills — often to boost themselves out of a life of poverty — and why local employers have to tap out-of-state workers for jobs that otherwise could have gone to residents a few blocks away.It also raises questions, as Boston faces another urgent crisis to turn around Madison Park, about what it will take for the city to develop a top-notch vocational high school, like those that thrive in almost every corner of the state, or whether it is doomed to repeat the failures of its past.“Madison Park has tremendous potential if we could ever get it together,” said Michael Contompasis, a former Boston school superintendent, noting that Worcester has transformed its vocational school into a national model. “It’s a question of leadership, it’s a question of political will, and it’s a question of rethinking all the recommendations ever made.”Some educators and education advocates in the city question whether the problems facing Madison Park are surmountable, \nand believe Boston should consider starting \n\na new vocational school from scratch. The decades of disappointment, they say, have bred a deeply rooted culture of distrust and entrenched territorialism within the school and the neighborhood around it.Overhaul efforts through the years have often stalled or failed as teachers, community activists, and political leaders have clashed over philosophical differences in how to push the school forward, and debates over whether motives were fueled by the interest of students or personal or political agendas.Looming over these fights is a School Department that state and city leaders have criticized for valuing college preparatory programs over vocational education and for lacking a basic understanding of what it takes to train students for technical careers or the trades. That has led to ill-fated decisions, such as appointing headmasters without the appropriate expertise, and filling seats at Madison Park with students who have failing grades, disciplinary problems, and no interest in vocational education.\nYet every time state or city officials propose spinning off Madison Park from the city school system, allowing it to operate as an independent school system like nearly every other vocational school across the state, the School Department balks. Some teachers get nervous they will lose their jobs or protection under the Boston Teachers Union contract, and community activists protest, fearing such a move could prevent fewer Roxbury students from enrolling.Just this summer, an intervention team, appointed by Interim Superintendent John McDonough and the Boston Teachers Union to craft a set of remedies for Madison Park, recommended closing the school in three years and replacing it with a regional vocational school at another site if a turnaround fails. McDonough rejected the idea.“It is my belief and intent to focus on success rather than planning for failure,” McDonough said. But he acknowledged the challenges are immense, including developing a new culture and mindset at the school.“I think you have a lot of frustration among faculty and particularly the students who say that we keep promising stuff and not delivering,” McDonough said in an interview, vowing the School Department would do better. “We have an opportunity now to deliver. It does require changes, but it can be done.” \nAs school opened this fall, the situation at Madison Park could not have been more bleak. The school scrambled to hire nearly 60 teachers and administrators in August, and some positions remain unfilled. Many students and teachers went about a week without a legitimate class schedule, prompting students to demonstrate.Headmaster Diane Ross Gary, who took the reins just a year earlier, resigned a few days later, as a growing number of teachers, students, and parents called for her termination. The School Department had resisted firing her for months, and several black political leaders and community activists had lobbied Mayor Martin J. Walsh to keep her in the post, saying she deserved more time to prove herself.In the end, Gary, who had no prior experience as a headmaster, had failed to gain state certification to lead a school in Massachusetts.All of this occurred as Madison Park was supposed to be starting the third year of a turnaround effort that was pushed by then-mayor Thomas M. Menino, who promised in his 2012 State of the City address to transform the school into a critical job training center for students and adults alike.Each year of the turnaround has been marked by notable missteps. Scores on the Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System exams this spring dropped in each subject area. In science, for instance, just 3 percent of 10th-graders scored proficient, down from 25 percent who scored proficient or advanced the previous year. The school’s graduation rate of 63.6 percent, while largely improving, still remains more than 20 percentage points below the state average. “We have kids here who can’t read,” said one teacher who was not authorized to speak to the news media. “We have a huge problem with kids who can’t do fractions. To me that’s a real crisis.”The poor academic achievement, combined with student behavior problems, severely restricts the school’s ability to place students in apprenticeship programs, a key path to employment.Vocational education experts also say Madison Park is not establishing enough placements in small private businesses, which are more apt to hire students after graduation than large corporations or government agencies. The dismal record has Mitchell Chester, the state commissioner of elementary and secondary education, contemplating whether he should formally declare the school “underperforming,” a move that could set the stage for state receivership in three years absent a dramatic turnaround. A decision is expected in the coming weeks.\nBoston’s early problems with vocational education were rooted in racial inequities that prompted federal court intervention. White students typically attended high schools with more modern facilities than those used by black and Latino students at the crumbling Boston Trade High School in Mission Hill.\nUS District Judge W. Arthur Garrity Jr. embraced the Madison Park project, calling it the “keystone” of his plans in the 1970s to desegregate the public schools. A team of experts traveled across the country to develop the programming for what would be called the Humphrey Occupational Resource Center, which opened in 1980 at the Madison Park complex. Initially, the Humphrey Center taught students for a half-day from all the high schools across the city who wanted to learn a trade, and it operated separately from Madison Park High School, which at the time had a strong focus on music. States across the nation had successfully used half-day programs, but in Boston the arrangement would be short-lived. Confronted with declining enrollment at both the Humphrey Center and Madison Park, the School Committee voted in 1986 to merge the two amid budget-cutting. It also decided to give away a chunk of the complex, including the science building and later the music center, to a new exam school, now called the O’Bryant School of Math and Science.The merger did not go well. Within a few years, state education officials placed several vocational programs on probation.“It was a travesty of epic proportions,” said Judith Baker, who taught English at Madison Park from 1979 to 2005 and is now a member of the Friends of Madison Park. “The parents were right to be angry. Madison Park began to deteriorate as a technical school. The superintendent of schools didn’t believe in vocational education at all. We didn’t have any defenders.”\nTo this day, the repercussions of the merger resonate, contributing to an identity crisis that has lasted to this day over whether Madison Park is truly a citywide vocational high school or a neighborhood high school for Roxbury that happens to have vocational programs as electives, said Charles Lyons, the superintendent-director of Shawsheen Valley Technical High School in Billerica and a member of the Madison Park intervention team.He said the key to Madison Park’s future success is to sever it from the school system and have an independent board of experts run it.“The kids are worthy of a high-quality first-class technical education,” Lyons said. “Boston has the financial capability to provide it. The adults have to make it happen.”State education officials first raised the idea of independent oversight in the late 1980s, believing it was the only way to ensure Madison Park would get the appropriate attention. But the School Department resisted.Then-mayor Raymond Flynn, concerned that Boston was failing to prepare enough students for jobs on the Big Dig and other major projects, called for Madison Park to become an independent vocational school in his 1992 State of the City address. But the proposal sparked bitter protests from students, community activists, and disaffected faculty, who repeatedly spread false rumors that Flynn wanted to give away seats to suburbanites.\n\n\nA year later, students descended on City Hall to protest. Menino, who was preparing to become acting mayor because Flynn was departing to become ambassador to the Vatican, met with a few of the students. After they emerged from the meeting, other protesters pelted Menino with snowballs, even though he remained undecided about the proposal.The issue ultimately proved too toxic during a mayoral election year and it died.Madison Park slipped from the headlines, and with a skilled headmaster at the helm for a few years, the school enjoyed an academic reemergence. But that, too, would be short-lived, undermined by a succession of headmasters and then a laser-like focus on improving MCAS scores, sacrificing time in vocational education classes for test prep.Menino would not enter the fray of turning around Madison Park again until his 2012 speech, setting off a new round of acrimony.On the morning students protested last month — demanding their class schedules immediately — a handful of carpentry students, who had already been assigned some courses, were on the other side of Roxbury, pouring cement for the foundation of a single-family house they are helping to build.Madison Park teachers, administrators and supporters point to the activity on the job site that morning as evidence that good things are happening there. “The staff has worked very hard to make sure the school is moving forward and are trying to make sure the education is current and relevant and prepares them for the future,” said Al Holland, the school’s acting headmaster.\nOn a tour of the 900-student school one recent morning, the chaos of last month appeared to have subsided. Nicely painted hallways were quiet. Freshmen in one math class listened carefully to a lesson on solving algebraic equations; students in the electrical shop diligently wired light switches; and students donned chef caps as they sliced peaches for a cobbler.Teachers talked enthusiastically about their programs and grooming students for the workforce or college. Vincent Fanuele, a carpentry teacher, said one of his most important tasks is “to develop their character and their professional skills.” A group of seniors studying automotives said the school has helped them see the merits of going to college. Some talked of becoming engineers; others to get more advanced credentials to be mechanics.”This school has opened my eyes to so many things I never knew before,”",

They are the friendly face of Boston’s parks, providing directions for tourists and the mounted backdrop for countless smiling family photographs.But park rangers are also the first line of defense of public safety, patrolling Boston Common and other city green areas on horseback, keeping the peace, and enforcing the law.\n\t\nIt was in this role that James Lunnin and Albert Hurd were stabbed Tuesday on the Common, when they confronted a homeless man brandishing a knife.Both men were recovering from their injuries Wednesday. Hurd, who was critically injured, has responded well to surgery at Massachusetts General Hospital and “is awake and alert,” said Parks and Recreation Commissioner Chris Cook. Lunnin has been released from Tufts Medical Center.“We’re very happy with their progress,” said Cook.Friends and family of Lunnin and Hurd said they are well suited to the job of being in constant contact with, and providing safety for, the people who frequent the city’s Emerald Necklace parks system.Lunnin’s mother, Linda Shaughnessy, said that the 25-year-old is drawn to public service and that he served a year in Afghanistan with the Army National Guard. Hurd, 46, is a veteran ranger who joined the force in 1992 and is known for his dedication to the mounted unit.“The rangers are amazing. They are incredibly selfless,” said Connie Brown, who is the event coordinator for Friends of the Boston Park Rangers Mounted Unit, a nonprofit organization.The group donates $155,000 to the city every year to pay for the horses and keep the mounted unit going. A fund-raiser is set for Thursday at the Parkman House to support the organization’s efforts. The group is pressing ahead with the event with the blessing of Hurd, said Brown.The city has not named the injured rangers publicly, but they are identified in court documents filed in the case of Bodio Hutchinson, who is accused of assaulting them.Julia H. Donahue, president of the board of directors for the mounted unit’s friends group, said Hurd is a “thoughtful, caring public servant.”“He’s one of these wonderful park rangers that we are so fortunate to have in the city, no question,” Donahue said.”He’s one of these very thoughtful, caring, effective people.”Lunnin, who lives in Dorchester, joined the rangers this year as a seasonal hire, city officials said. Shaughnessy, his mother, said he “loves it,” but the job has a dangerous side. She said her son has told her about rapes and drug deals taking place in city parks.“He’s experienced a lot of stuff that he never thought he’d be seeing,” Shaughnessy said. “He doesn’t have anything to protect himself except for a billy club.”The city employs 12 full-time rangers, and hires additional seasonal staff to assist with patrols from March to November, said Ryan Woods, a spokesman for the city’s parks department. The starting salary is more than $14 an hour, he said.The rangers were established in 1982 as a seasonal program and expanded into a year-round force in 1988, Woods said. Initially, rangers were not armed, but they were later equipped with mace and batons, said Park Rangers Chief Gene Survillo said. He said rangers have never carried firearms. They carry handcuffs and have the authority to make arrests.Their training lasts four weeks and includes instruction in tactical defense techniques with batons and mace, Survillo said. The Boston Police Academy provides training in areas like self- defense, dealing with people who are emotionally disturbed or mentally ill, and learning city ordinances and state laws, said Sergeant Michael McCarthy, a police spokesman.Boston police also patrol places where rangers work, such as Boston Common, the Public Garden, Jamaica Pond, and Franklin Park, McCarthy said.“It’s a spirit of collaboration versus division,” said Cook, the parks commissioner.Survillo said rangers treat situations they encounter on a case-by-case basis, and call in additional resources like firefighters, emergency medical services, and police as needed.“We assess the situation and then we make decisions accordingly,” Survillo said. “We’ve been dealing with the various activities, both good and bad, in the parks system for many years now.”McCarthy said the force has proven itself to be effective, and self-reliant, in its role.“It’s not that often that they reach out to us to assist in the routine things,” he said. “And they offer a great service.”Mayor Martin J. Walsh, who visited both rangers in the hospital, said in a statement that the stabbing was “unfortunate.”“We’re going to take a look at what options are on the table -- if more police patrols might be necessary on the Common, or if there are other measures that can be taken around security,” he said.Shaughnessy said Lunnin is doing well and will recover.“He’s going to do just fine. Thank God,” she said.Joshua Janson, who is on the board of directors for the Friends of the Boston Park Rangers Mounted Unit, said Hurd knows the risks associated with the job.“He knows the name of the game, and this is just something that came out of the blue. But rangers put their lives at risk for the safety of our parks all the time,” Janson said. “If it wasn’t for them, we wouldn’t be safe in the parks.”
The freelance TV cameraman from Rhode Island who became infected with the Ebola virus in Liberia is recovering, and this week expressed on Twitter his “endless gratitude for the good vibes” he has received while being treated at a Nebraska hospital.“Back on Twitter, feeling like I’m on the road to good health,” Ashoka Mukpo tweeted Monday. “Will be posting some thoughts this week.” \n\n\t\nThe 33-year-old, who grew up in Providence, had recently begun working for NBC News when he fell ill. He said in his tweet that NBC’s “compassion and humanity” had touched him deeply.Mukpo has been undergoing experimental treatment for the viral illness at Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha since Oct. 6, the same biocontainment unit where Dr. Richard Sacra, a Massachusetts physician, was treated for Ebola after working in Liberia.Mukpo last week received a plasma transfusion from Dr. Kent Brantly, an American doctor who was the first to come to the United States for treatment after being infected with the Ebola virus in west Africa. \nTaylor Wilson, a spokesman for Nebraska Medical Center, said Wednesday that Mukpo’s health “continues to turn in the right direction.”Mukpo, in his tweets, expressed concern about those still suffering in Liberia without adequate care.“Now that I’ve had firsthand experience with this scourge of a disease, I’m even more pained at how little care sick west Africans are receiving,” he tweeted.As of Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported nearly 9,000 cases in the ongoing outbreak, with nearly 4,500 deaths.
Bad news on the Halloween front --- Boston has slipped badly on the annual Zillow Trick-or-Treat Index, falling to seventh place on the 2014 list after ranking second only a year ago.Does an outbreak of Halloween stinginess in these parts account for this sudden fall from grace? Can the ascendancy of Los Angeles and San Jose at the expense of the Hub be explained by Dorchester households suddenly turning away costumed kids en masse? \n\t\nAccording to a Zillow press release, its index represents cities that will “provide the most candy, in the least amount of time, with the fewest safety risks.” In devising its rankings, Zillow looks at four factors: home values, population density, a neighborhood’s walkability, and crime rates. Being an online real estate database, Seattle-based  also attaches a lot of weight to its Zillow Home Value Index. If year-to-year home values are up in a city, Zillow reasons that residents are feeling wealthy and generous, and as a result, kids can expect to reap a bonanza of trick-or-treat largesse. In explaining the rankings, Zillow economist Skylar Olsen was quick to explain that Boston’s trick-or-treat score is holding steady and strong. But what happened is that other cities are vaulting ahead. Los Angeles is one example, ranking second on the 2014 survey. (For the record, San Francisco is tops. Chicago, Philadelphia, and San Jose are third, fourth, and fifth, repsectively.)The median home value for a home within LA’s city limits was $525,200 at the end of August, up 11 percent on a year-to-year comparison basis, Olsen said. The value of a home in the city of Boston, meanwhile, was $430,500 at the end of August, up 6.2 percent by Zillow’s metrics.San Francisco has now topped the rankings for four years in a row. Inside Boston, Zillow ranks the best neighborhoods for trick-or-treating as Beacon Hill, Back Bay, the North End, the South End, and the Fenway.
The Goya exhibition at the Museum of Fine Arts — easily the finest show at that institution since “Degas and the Nude” in 2011-12 — ends on a disarming and deeply affecting note. It’s a portrait of the artist himself, Francisco Goya (1746-1828), propped up in bed. He is supported from behind by his physician, a phlegmatic-looking fellow who leans in to proffer a medicinal drink. The ailing artist’s face is pasty grey, with a sheen of sweat playing across his brow and cheek. His jaw is slack. His heavy head lolls to one side. And his eyes, half-closed, look incapable of focusing on anything. Get up close, turn your ear to the painting, and you can almost hear the first stirrings of a death rattle.\n\t\nGoya, who was 73 at the time, painted this work after recovering — miraculously, he felt — from a grave illness. He dedicated it to his doctor. An inscription at the bottom reads, in part, “Goya in gratitude to his friend Arrieta: for the skill and care with which he saved his life in his acute and dangerous illness...”The painting closes the circle on an exhibition that contains, near the beginning, images of infants being similarly cradled and coddled (although also violently spanked), and fresh-faced young children looking directly at the viewer in a way that, in this late picture, proved beyond the ailing artist.Goya’s approach, here and throughout the show, is brisk and businesslike. He was an artist willing to indulge many moods, but sentimentality was not one of them. Sniffing its presence, he reverted instantly to his baseline mode: a sardonic contempt, toxic to open-heartedness, but in the end — and given the circumstances — more trustworthy than any alternative. He was nobody’s fool.And that, perhaps, is what makes the late self-portrait with his physician so moving. By the time you come to it, you have hurtled down a series of subterranean rapids, a nightmare realm of witches’ Sabbaths, wheeling bats, dismembered corpses, corrupted clerics, and skewered bulls. You are ready to receive any tenderness, any small act of kindness, with utmost thanks. And Goya, whose imagination spewed out so much psychic muck, is not only there for you, he is there for himself, there for all of us. He has been granted a reprieve (albeit temporary; he died eight years later) and now offers up to us, as to his dear doctor, this sincere expression of tender pity. Oh hallelujah! Hope lives.You’ll find it nowhere else in this show.A number of Goya exhibitions in recent years have focused on this or that aspect of the great Spaniard’s work: his small paintings (Madrid, London, Chicago, 1994), drawings from his private albums (London, 2001), his images of women (Washington, D.C., 2002), his last works (New York, 2006), his printmaking (Paris, 2008), and so on. This large MFA show — 170 works — is a rare attempt to see Goya whole. Organized by the MFA’s Stephanie Stepanek and Frederick Ilchman, it includes prints from all of Goya’s major series, drawings, portraits, self-portraits, and religious paintings, as well as many of his smaller, uninhibited, often fantastical paintings. It boasts loans from institutions all over Europe and the U.S., including the Prado (whose Goya holdings are unsurpassed), the Louvre, the Uffizi, the Palais de Beaux Arts in Lille, the Royal Palace of Madrid, the Art Institute of Chicago, the Metropolitan Museum, the Hispanic Society of America in New York, and Boston’s own Atheneum and Public Library.The show is organized not chronologically or by medium, but rather by theme, with small clusters of works — often made years apart — devoted to particular themes or recurring motifs. The approach threatens to unleash anarchy. But it works. There is a particular emphasis on Goya’s many images of flying, falling, swinging, and losing balance, which is very interesting, and on a broader dichotomy, captured in the show’s title, between order and disorder, which struck me as redundant. Life itself, after all, is a tussle between order and disorder, and so is all great art. The MFA’s ability to mount such a dazzling show owes much to Eleanor Sayre, a longtime curator of prints and drawings at the MFA, who died in Cambridge, aged 85, in 2001. A granddaughter of Woodrow Wilson, Sayre was one of the world’s leading authorities on Goya’s works on paper. She spent many years building up the MFA’s Goya holdings. (She also, rather wonderfully, brought a large show of the drawings and book illustrations of Beatrix Potter to the MFA, which established a temporary petting zoo in its courtyard for the occasion.)What, then, does Goya look like, whole? Not a bit like Beatrix Potter. He looks, rather, like a stupendously original and inventive artist, who achieved greatness in spite of some glaring technical limitations. Electrifying in his great print series — in particular, “Los Desastres de la Guerra,” “Los Caprichos,” and “Los Disparates” — he was nevertheless insecure when it came to anatomy (very noticeable in his female nudes, including the Prado’s famous “Naked Maja,” which is not in this show). His religious pictures, with few exceptions, are insipid. And his portraits are frequently weakened by what John Updike called “a button-eyed cartoonishness that thins their human presence.”Updike’s rough but, I think, fair description applies even to Goya’s celebrated portrait of the Duchess of Alba, the centerpiece of a large gallery billed as the finest congregation of Goya portraits anywhere in the world. It shows the duchess, whom Goya fancied but probably failed to bed in a black mantilla (she was in mourning for her young husband) with a bright red sash that once belonged to her late father, a captain general.The duchess points down at the arid Andalusian earth in front of her glittering, pointed pumps. Inscribed in the sand are the words “Solo Goya” — “only Goya.” The gesture is more a marker of the artist’s self-regard than an attempt to publicize the duchess’s regard for him. But, combined with her pursed mouth and implacable stare, it gives the portrait the instant intensity of a flamenco dancer’s heel snap. Still, her face remains somewhat vapid, and the portrait is bettered by other, more subtle portraits here. One is a very fine seated portrait of an elegant, elderly woman, the Marchioness of Villafranca. Another is a full-length portrait of a young woman, believed to be Maria Luisa de Vallabriga, dressed in a simple Empire gown. And a third, smaller portrait shows a dashing artist, identity unknown, in a long black smock with blue trimming, dramatically posed before an atmospheric background of wooden scaffolding.In all three cases — but not always in Goya’s other portraits — the modeling, the sense of close-in scrutiny, and a degree of psychological perceptiveness instantly convince you of the sitter’s presence.These commanding works are matched by a number of images of Goya himself, on both canvas and paper. The most arresting (aside from the late double portrait with his doctor) shows us Goya at this peak. It’s the “Self-Portrait While Painting,” of about 1795. A freely brushed, bravura image, it shares some of the quietude and mysterious atmosphere — the sense of an alchemist at work, brewing unknowable things — of Rembrandt’s “Artist in his Studio,” owned by the MFA. It complements a softer, more vulnerable image Goya painted of himself in 1815, hanging nearby. We think of Goya as one of the first of the moderns. The characterization is confirmed when we see how many later moderns identified with him, from Manet to Picasso, from Otto Dix to Salvador Dali, and from Robert Gober to the Chapman Brothers. But of course, much of what Goya painted was relatively conventional, and had to be if he was to sustain his position as painter to the courts he served. His reputation for modernity can be partly attributed to the period he lived through. The 18th-century enlightenment and its violent struggle for oxygen in repressive, suffocating Spain, the French and American revolutions, and the Napoleonic adventure all ushered in states of skepticism and permanent insecurity that became hallmarks of 20th-century modernity. Goya saw much of this first hand. (“Yo lo vi,” as the caption of one of his most famous prints affirms: “I saw it.”) He felt Napoleon’s invasion, in particular, as a direct, concrete, and complex reality, not merely an abstract ideal or a muffled side effect. His critical eye — the intolerance with which he greeted whatever was backward and benighted — also marks him out as modern, although here we may exaggerate Goya’s humanism, his enlightened secularism, in order to make him match an image we may wish to maintain of ourselves. To my eyes, what makes Goya most refreshing is the rampant, unbounded quality his art possesses. You can call it a modern quality, but it is really not the point. “There are no rules in painting,” he said in a 1792 address. And of course, the dictum applies with double the force to his drawings and prints. Don’t misunderstand me. Goya’s graphic inventions are extremely artful; they employ compositional devices and dramatic tonal effects to bring order and unity to unruly subject matter. But they are fired, above all, by an urgency, a freewheeling immediacy, and a sense of solutions cooked up in the heat of the moment, that can utterly overpower you. They also mark the beginning of a tendency that is noticeable again first in Courbet, with his clumsy palette-knife effects, then in Manet, with his awkward compositions and abrupt tonal shifts, and eventually in Matisse, Picasso, and much of the rest of the 20th century avant-garde — to equate gaucheness with directness, ham-fistedness with sincerity, and virtuosity with lies. Goya himself was as interested in lies as he was in truth. His scenes of witchcraft, the lynchings, the rapes, the twisting and dancing giants, the fraudulent phantoms, the drunks, the donkeys, the dreamers, the dead animals — all gather to a greatness in our minds as we view his work in depth. Eventually, they trigger an apprehension that feels more ancient than modern to me: an understanding that truth-telling and fantasy might co-exist, and even be mutually enhancing.\n\n- \n
NEW YORK — The newly published author sat in a wheelchair in an ornate townhouse once owned by Franklin D. Roosevelt. He looked out at a room of people eager to hear tales from his 20-year run as a big city mayor.But first, Thomas M. Menino had to will himself to stand. It was almost as if he were reenacting a scene from his memoir, when he climbed out of a wheelchair to address a service at the Cathedral of the Holy Cross a few days after the Boston Marathon bombings.\n\t\nMenino summoned a deep breath. He pushed with both hands on the arms of his wheelchair and rose to his feet. The 71-year-old former mayor leaned on his old baseball-bat cane and took a few shuffling steps to his seat for a discussion of his book, “Mayor for a New America.”\nThe transition from mayor to author has been complicated. Menino has been weakened by cancer. And this week, just as he embarked on a book tour, laryngitis stole his voice.But Tuesday night at  at Hunter College, as he sipped steaming lemon water and spoke in a gravelly whisper, Menino showed flashes of the mayoral gravitas that once permeated City Hall. When asked how Boston distributed aid money so quickly to victims of the Marathon bombings, he responded with a three-word quip that delighted the crowd of roughly 75.“I’m the mayor,” Menino said.The five-term mayor has embarked on a whirlwind media tour, coaxing his voice to cooperate as he stops at MSNBC, Fox, and CNN.\n\nAt the radio studios of WNYC, Menino laid the blame for Boston’s divisive school integration on politicians who kept “all the blacks in one area” and “forced” the judge to implement a faulty busing plan. Then a coughing fit interrupted Menino mid-sentence.Menino plans to attend private book parties at Boston University and his publisher, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, and is scheduled next week for a book signing and media appearances in Washington, if his health allows.At the end of the month, there’s a signing scheduled at  and an , Mayor Martin J. Walsh, at the Boston Book Festival. It is a far cry from the schedule he kept just 10 months ago as he moved out of his fifth-floor office at City Hall.“It’s quite different,” Menino said. “Now I get to be the critic.”Having the kickoff at Roosevelt House somehow seemed appropriate, underscoring Menino’s connection to the long arc of progressive politics in America. The Neo-Georgian townhouse, sitting blocks away from Central Park, was one of the places where Roosevelt found a renewed sense of purpose after being paralyzed by polio.The house later served as the launching pad for the political career of America’s longest-serving president. In the same upper room where Roosevelt laid the foundation of the New Deal, Menino sat near a floor-to-ceiling window overlooking East 65th Street.“Putting your memoirs together is very difficult,” Menino said over the din of cocktail chatter. “It wasn’t ever about me. It was about the city of Boston.”Former New York mayor Michael R. Bloomberg greeted Menino with the warmth of an old friend. In introductory remarks at the book party, Bloomberg described Menino as “one of the most successful mayors to ever run a city in the United States.” History, he said, will include Menino in the same breath as transcendent big city mayors the likes of New York’s Fiorello LaGuardia and Chicago’s Richard Daley.“He really was the mayors’ mayor,” Bloomberg said of Menino. “When you get to heaven, my attitude is don’t stop and ask, just walk right in. You have earned this.”Menino, wearing a dark suit and a light blue tie the same hue as Boston’s city flag, recounted anecdotes and lessons from the book. He talked about the response to the Marathon bombings, the imperative to be a sound steward of city finances, and the deliberate effort to win over constituents a conversation at a time.“Unless people trust you,” Menino said, “you can’t do what you want to do.”Laryngitis caused his voice to falter and crack. His wife, Angela, and his former press secretary, Dot Joyce, urged him on with gestures from the front row. They reminded him to sip his water and at one point, a throat lozenge was passed from wife to spokeswoman to mayor.To distract from his rasp, Menino leaned on self-deprecating quips and his trademark grin that seemed to suggest, “I’m-the-mayor-what-are-you-going-to-do-about-it.”Angela Menino said her husband frequently catches laryngitis in October, which often coincided with debates during election years. The former mayor has not been using a wheelchair in Boston, she said, but there was a lot of walking in New York.The first audience question veered off topic when a woman asked about what she described as lack of access at Boston museums for the hearing impaired. After a brief discussion, Menino offered a solution:“Talk to the new mayor.”The crowd included Menino’s daughter, Susan Menino Fenton; former top aide, Michael Kineavy; City Councilor Stephen J. Murphy; publicist George Regan; and actor Kevin Chapman.Chapman is in New York filming the Detective Lionel Fusco role in the television series “Person of Interest.” He worked for Menino as neighborhood services coordinator in Dorchester for almost nine years and recalled rushing to overnight fires to help residents who lost their homes. “The biggest fear in the office was that at 3 a.m. the mayor would beat you to a call,” Chapman said.As a New Yorker, Dana Matlin never had a chance to vote for Menino. Just the same, the 59-year-old came to the book party, lured by the mayor’s reputation. “I just wanted to hear what he had to say,” Matlin said. “I thought it was fascinating. I could see why he was so effective.”
The University of Massachusetts Amherst is investigating racist vandalism that targeted students in their dormitories over the past week.\nThree messages, all found inside dorm buildings in the Southwest residential part of campus, called for killing black and Mexican people, according to .\n\t\n“Such expressions of hate and intolerance have no place on our campus,” Chancellor Kumble Subbaswamy wrote in a campuswide e-mail this week. “We condemn language intended to marginalize or make any member of our community unsafe, and we will aggressively investigate this matter for criminal and administrative reviews.”Campus spokesman Edward Blaguszewski said Thursday the racist graffiti was first reported to university police on Saturday. A second case was reported Monday, which prompted Subbaswamy’s e-mail on Tuesday. Discovery of a third racist message was reported to police Wednesday.It is unclear whether the messages were written by the same person or persons, Blaguszewski said.\nSeveral students told the Gazette they had not experienced racism before at UMass.Blaguszewski said that while racist incidents are uncommon on campus, it is important for the school and its community to condemn such acts.Josh Odam, who said he found a racist message scrawled in all capital letters on his door, wrote an  Thursday in the Daily Collegian student newspaper.“This cowardly act of hate speech not only violated my space, but permeated the ‘harambee’ community we have worked so hard to build,” wrote Odam, secretary of diversity for the Student Government Association. Harambee is an East African word that means unity or working together as a community.“To be blunt, whoever did this messed with the wrong one,” he added. “They went to the wrong door, the wrong floor, and the wrong community. We will not stand for this ignorance on our campus and will hold the university and ourselves directly accountable to ensure the safety of black students, students of color, and the entire population.”Blaguszewski said a group of concerned students organized a meeting on campus Wednesday night to discuss the incidents. More than 100 people attended, including Subbaswamy and other university administrators.In his e-mail, Subbaswamy invited students to attend a previously scheduled meeting Thursday afternoon on diversity, equity, and inclusion at UMass.“As a community, it is imperative we work together to reaffirm our values of inclusion and respect for all,” he wrote. “We must acknowledge the power of language and use it to advance social justice, inclusion and access. We must ensure that all members of our community experience a welcoming and safe environment in which to live, learn and work.”
The faces of the Boston Fire Department look a whole lot different today.Boston Fire Commissioner Joe Finn and Commissioner of Inspectional Services William “Buddy” Christopher shaved their staple mustaches on Thursday in support of the TK Fund, which was set up to support Boston firefighter Eddie Kelly’s 4-year-old son, Tommy, who was diagnosed with Stage IV cancer. \n\t\n“It’s just a way to support the Kelly family,” said Boston Fire Department spokesman Steve MacDonald. “Anyone who’s seen a child go through an aggressive cancer treatment, people feel helpless. ... One thing people can do is donate money to those who are fighting cancer.”Finn and Christopher originally made a bet that whoever raised less money for Tommy would have to shave their ’stache, MacDonald said. But they quickly realized they could instead pool their funds — which totaled to $10,000 — and agreed to both lose their characteristic facial hair.About 50 people, including a rambunctious Tommy, also known as “TK,” gathered Thursday at Florian Hall in Dorchester to watch the two lose their mustaches in solidarity with the fundraiser, MacDonald said.  “Finn said his three adult children have never seen him without a mustache ... and estimated he’s had it for something like 35 years,” MacDonald said. “And Christoper said he’s had his for about 20 years, although it’s probably been longer.” At the fundraiser, commissioners presented the Kellys with the $10,000 check that the fund’s committee will decide how to spend, along with the Inspectional Services Department that presented the committee with a check for $5,000, MacDonald said. “It was a comical, nice little event. They were both good sports, and raised some substantial money, which was nice,” MacDonald said. “The bottom line is that the event is just letting the Kelly family know that they have support for TK.” This is TK’s second shaving-related fund-raiser, which also raises money for cancer treatment and research. In August, hundreds turned out for the Great Buzz Off for TK, where dozens of people had their heads shaved in solidarity with Tommy.Another fund-raiser is scheduled for late November, MacDonald said.\n
Attorney General Martha Coakley made national headlines in June by suing two federal agencies for refusing to sell homes in foreclosure to nonprofit groups that want to return them to the original owners. Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, she said, cannot “stand in the way of this work to help struggling families stay in their homes.”What Coakley did not say is that the only nonprofit in the country that buys and sells distressed properties like that is run by the cochair of her campaign finance committee, Elyse Cherry, who hosted a Coakley fund-raiser days before the lawsuit. Cherry acknowledges that she and her staff even wrote the legislative language that Coakley sued over.\n\n\t\nCoakley said that her lawsuit, now in federal court, is part of her longtime push to get mortgage lenders to modify the terms of loans before foreclosing on homeowners who have fallen behind on payments.She said she wasn’t trying to give a personal benefit to Cherry, who made $590,000 last year running Boston Community Capital in Roxbury’s Dudley Square. Cherry said the lawsuit wouldn’t increase her pay or her organization’s income.“This has been a big push since the time I became attorney general and we started to see predatory lending,” said Coakley, who took office in 2007. “One of the big roadblocks to helping everybody were Fannie and Freddie,” which hold or guarantee more than 60 percent of all US home mortgages.Though Cherry’s work has drawn high-profile supporters, Coakley’s lawsuit is drawing criticism from a prominent affordable housing advocate who opposes Cherry’s approach and a government ethics champion who says Coakley should have disclosed her ties to Cherry to avoid the appearance she’s doing favors for insiders.“It’s important that the public knows about private dealings that could potentially affect government action,” said Pam Wilmot, executive director of Common Cause, a nonprofit group that promotes transparency in government.Coakley said there was no need to file a public disclosure with the State Ethics Commission since Cherry’s $3,250 in state donations to Coakley since 2005, the $1,500 she gave to Coakley’s failed US Senate bid in 2010, and the $5,000 she donated to the Democratic State Committee in September are already matters of public record.Cherry is more than just a contributor: She’s one of three cochairs of Coakley’s finance committee, hosting at least five fund-raisers this year and writing a glowing endorsement of Coakley in “The Rainbow Times,” a newspaper of the gay, bisexual, and transgender community, two days after Coakley filed her lawsuit.Bruce Marks, a longtime housing advocate and chief executive of the Neighborhood Assistance Corporation for America in Jamaica Plain, said Coakley is damaging her credibility on the foreclosure issue by fighting for Cherry’s program, which he believes benefits Boston Community Capital more than homeowners.Marks said that Cherry’s buyback program is flawed because Boston Community Capital buys foreclosed-upon homes at a discount from lenders, but doesn’t pass along all the savings to families that were foreclosed upon. Instead, her group typically boosts the resale price by at least 25 percent, Boston-area property records show.Cherry “paints herself as this advocate for the consumer, and it’s the opposite,” said Marks, noting that he makes about one-quarter as much money — $150,000 a year — and considers himself well compensated.But Cherry said the program has no effect on her salary, which she said is based on comparisons to leaders of similar nonprofits such as the Combined Jewish Philanthropies and the Boston Foundation.Coakley, whose office oversees nonprofit agencies and charities and who has railed against high nonprofit compensation, said she was unaware of Cherry’s salary, but would “reach out to her board to get the documents and protocol” they used to justify her pay.Cherry said that she was trying to develop a new tool to help distressed homeowners keep their houses, and that her group does not make a profit on the program, dubbed SUN for Stabilizing Urban Neighborhoods. She said that Boston Community Capital has helped keep 500 homeowners in their homes through the program, and that it could help many more across the country if Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were willing to work with the group.All the revenue collected from the resale goes into paying expenses and creating a reserve fund for losses, since a small percentage of the homeowners end up in foreclosure again.“This is not a profit-making undertaking,” asserted Cherry. “What is the benefit to us?”\n\nCoakley said the decision to sue was not her idea — it came from her staff after a Globe column on the subject this year. And Coakley officials stress that there is at least one other nonprofit group that would benefit if Coakley prevails, a small group called the Coalition for Occupied Homes in Foreclosure. This group buys distressed homes and rents them to the original owners.Cherry, a national leader in the antiforeclosure movement, has high-profile advocates who publicly support her efforts. Former Federal Reserve Bank chairman Ben Bernanke has cited Boston Community Capital’s SUN program as a creative approach to a difficult problem.And former mayor Thomas M. Menino has said the program “is not only bringing hope to its clients, but also making a difference in the quality of life of our city neighborhoods.”Both Coakley and Cherry have been sparring with Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae for years, pressuring both agencies to be more receptive to renegotiating mortgages with distressed homeowners so that they can remain in their homes.Cherry turned to the Legislature for help in 2012 after Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac decided not to allow their foreclosed properties to be sold to Boston Community Capital.Cherry said she approached then Representative Kathi-Anne Reinstein of Revere, who Cherry had known from growing up in Revere, about adding language to an antiforeclosure bill that would essentially require federal agencies to do business with Boston Community Capital. The measure passed in July 2012.\nCherry said the federal mortgage agencies were concerned that, if homeowners discovered the mortgage buyback program, they would shirk their responsibility to live by the terms of their original mortgages and default.However, the chief attorney for Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae has indicated that the agencies were also concerned that programs like SUN could allow nonprofit groups to become middle men in real estate deals, buying homes at a discount and then boosting the resale price back to the homeowner “at a profit to the entity.”\nSix months after the Legislature passed the antiforeclosure bill, in February 2013, an aide to Coakley sent a letter to the Federal Housing Finance Agency saying that Coakley was “troubled” by Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae policies that “appear to violate provisions” of the new Massachusetts law to prevent foreclosures.A day later, Coakley called for the ouster of Edward J. DeMarco of the Federal Housing Finance Agency for refusing to do business with nonprofits like Boston Community Capital.Cherry joined Coakley’s campaign for governor right after she announced in September 2013, donating $1,000 of her own while cohosting several fund-raisers over the next nine months.Finally, in June 2014, Coakley filed suit in Suffolk Superior Court over the federal mortgage agencies’ refusal to comply with the Massachusetts law. The case was transferred to federal court at the request of the agencies.Cherry said Boston Community Capital pours all the money it collects from the SUN program into the time-consuming process of negotiating with the banks and underwriting the loans. SUN borrowers are poor credit risks, so the process is complex and protracted, she said.\nBut housing advocate Marks is skeptical that Cherry’s group does not generate surplus revenue since it makes money both from the 25 percent markup on the resale price and about $5,000 in fees the borrowers must bring to closing. It also charges 6 percent interest on the mortgage, two percentage points more than the group pays on the money it borrows to make its loans.“If a bank was doing that, you’d charge them with predatory lending,” said Marks, who said  his group collects a small fee from banks to help homeowners negotiate a reduced mortgage payment with their lenders.Cherry said the fight is not about her or her agency at all, but about the 17 families who will be forced out of their homes if the federal agencies don’t agree to sell to Boston Community Capital. If Freddie and Fannie cooperate, Cherry added, other agencies around the country could set up similar programs to keep more people in their homes.Coakley agreed wholeheartedly. “The idea was to benefit homeowners. It wasn’t about benefiting a company or a business or a not-for-profit.”\nBut Common Cause’s Wilmot said the merits of Cherry’s efforts to stop foreclosures do not excuse Coakley from disclosing her close personal ties to Cherry when she filed the lawsuit. On other occasions, Coakley has been vigilant about filing disclosures with the ethics commission.\n“The Massachusetts conflict of interest law requires public officials to file written disclosures when a reasonable person could conclude that they may be biased in their official duties because of personal, professional, or other connections with someone. This seems to be an example of an appearance requiring a written disclosure,” she said.
The MBTA plans to acquire 30 new self-propelled cars by 2018, a move that would bring faster and more frequent service to the Fairmount Line and possibly open up a direct train link from Allston to Assembly Square, Governor Deval Patrick said Thursday morning.The purchase of the cars, known as diesel multiple units, or DMUs, was just one of a quartet of announcements made in the parking lot of Jubilee Christian Church in Mattapan. \n\t\nThe governor also announced the proposed December 2017 opening of a new Blue Hill Avenue Station in Mattapan, weekend hourly commuter rail service on the Fairmount Line starting next month, and the agency’s commitment to keeping the Fairmount commuter line’s fares equal to the subway’s cheaper fares.Patrick said the first DMUs would be deployed on the Fairmount Line, but acquiring the trains could also open up other opportunities, such as a link from Assembly Square in Somerville to a recently announced commuter rail station in Allston, near the Massachusetts Turnpike tolls.“Basically anywhere there’s an existing rail line, to be able to run an efficient, lower-density, more regular subway-type service opens up all kinds of possibilities,” Patrick said.Transportation Secretary Richard Davey said the state expects the new railcars to cost about $240 million, and that the state will seek bids for proposals before the end of the year.The governor, the transportation secretary, and T general manager Beverly Scott were joined by local officials, most of whom deemed the 2017 opening of the Mattapan station a strong investment in an area that has long been neglected.The Blue Hill Avenue station will cost about $25.2 million, funded by an intergovernmental service agreement related to the Central Artery Project. Construction on the station is expected in November 2015, with a projected opening date of December 2017.The station is the last currently scheduled for construction on the Fairmount Line, which is the only commuter rail line that runs entirely in the city of Boston. The station has had its share of opposition. Mattapan resident Barbara Fields has stood against the project for a number of reasons, including the damage that construction could do to the foundation of nearby homes such as hers. She also said the noise, traffic, and lighting accompanying the station will negatively affect the quality of life in the area, and argues that residents already have ample access to public transportation.“We just don’t think it’s needed,” she said.The crowd at Thursday’s session disagreed. State Representative Russell E. Holmes recounted how growing up in the neighborhood meant sometimes taking as long as 45 minutes to an hour to take public transportation downtown. With the new stop, officials say that trip could be cut to eighteen minutes.State Representative Daniel R. Cullinane said the opening of the line and more frequent service means more economic development and access to opportunity for the neighborhood.“Quality rapid public transit, like what is being announced today, is fundamental to the equality both in our neighborhoods and in every community of the city of Boston,” he said. The weekend service, scheduled to start Nov. 29, will be the first time such a schedule has been offered on the Fairmount Line.Coupled with the lower fares, it appears to be another way that T officials are attempting to make the line look as convenient as the subway, even though its trains do not run as frequently. 
Republican gubernatorial candidate Charlie Baker on Thursday said revelations that Democratic Attorney General Martha Coakley’s lawsuit against two federal agencies could directly benefit her campaign finance committee’s co-chair raises “serious questions about the attorney general’s conduct and judgment.”Baker, discussing , said that “at a minimum,” Coakley “should have disclosed her relationship” with Elyse Cherry, who runs Roxbury-based Boston Community Capital and has helped Coakley raise money since joining her campaign last year.\n\t\n“I think the attorney general should have come clean,” Baker told reporters at a press conference in the atrium of a downtown office building.Baker cited Coakley’s previous run-in with campaign ethics,  for using federal campaign funds for a state election, and called the matter a symptom of “one-party rule.”Baker, who has , said Coakley’s action “raises the kind of question that regular people worry about, which is that there’s one set of rules for people on Beacon Hill and a different set of rules about everybody else.”Coakley’s campaign pointed to state campaign finance law stating that additional disclosure beyond the standard reporting of donations is unnecessary.Baker declined to weigh in on the merits of the lawsuit, which Coakley filed in June in Suffolk Superior Court against Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac because they would not sell foreclosed homes to nonprofits that intended to return the properties to their original owners. Cherry’s group is the only nonprofit in the country that runs such a program, the Globe reported Thursday.But Baker said, based on the opinion of a housing advocate quoted in the Globe article, he questions whether the Boston Community Capital program benefits homeowners.“Homeowners may have been disadvantaged as a result of this program,” Baker said.Coakley, in a press release, ripped Baker for refusing to take a stance on the lawsuit, charging that it amounted to backing for “Wall Street banks” and saying she was “proud of this lawsuit.”“This is outrageous — Wall Street banks have wreaked havoc on families all across Massachusetts, and Charlie Baker today chose to stand with those banks and not with families in danger of losing their homes,” Coakley said. “I have made a very different choice and I am proud to stand by that choice.”Baker’s press conference came a day after his campaign manager, Jim Conroy, accused Coakley of running an “incredibly negative and cynical campaign with no positive ideas.”Asked repeatedly to square the tone of his press conference with his campaign’s complaints, Baker repeated his criticism of Coakley’s actions.
James Lunnin, the 25-year-old park ranger attacked by a man wielding a knife in the Boston Common Tuesday, is doing fine — but he is exhausted, said his cousin, Dan Hennessey.Hennessey briefly spoke to reporters outside Lunnin’s Dorchester home Thursday. He said Lunnin would probably not speak publicly Thursday, because he is heavily medicated and tired.\n\t\n“He’s OK. Just tired. Little bit of pain today,” Hennessey said.Lunnin and another park ranger, Albert Hurd, 46, were allegedly attacked by Bodio S. Hutchinson, 34, a homeless man with a history of violent and bizarre behavior.Lunnin was released from the hospital Wednesday. Hurd, who was more seriously injured, is still hospitalized but responded well to surgery, said Parks and Recreation Commissioner Chris Cook.Lunnin’s mother, Linda Shaughnessy, said a park ranger’s job can be dangerous, but that her son “loves it.” Fortunately, Lunnin will recover.“He’s going to do just fine. Thank God,” she said.
As fears of the Ebola virus intensify, Massachusetts health officials sought Thursday to assure the public that the risk of a local outbreak is extremely low but acknowledged that more needs to be done to prepare for the possibility.\n“There is no textbook on Ebola care in the United States,” said Patrick Muldoon, president of UMass Memorial Medical Center in Worcester, this month. “We have to improve every day.” \n\t\nMuldoon was among a number of specialists and health officials who spoke at a State House hearing to assess how the state is preparing to handle the potential spread of the infectious disease. Concerns have escalated after two nurses in Texas were diagnosed with the virus. One of the nurses traveled from Cleveland to Dallas one day before developing symptoms. Ebola is contagious only if a patient is experiencing active symptoms.The Texas health care workers had treated a Liberian man, the first person diagnosed with Ebola in the United States. He died Oct. 8. State Representative Jeffrey Sanchez, a Jamaica Plain Democrat who chairs the Legislature’s joint public health committee, noted the “heightened sense of anxiety” among hospital workers, emergency responders, and the public. Karen Higgins, a nurse at Boston Medical Center and copresident of National Nurses United, a union of registered nurses, said that front-line medical workers had not been well trained for an outbreak and that hospital staff needed better protective equipment to ensure safe treatment. “We are not properly prepared,” she said, drawing applause from a contingent of nurses who attended the hearing. The meeting followed two Boston-area scares last weekend. In one, a patient who had traveled to Liberia was isolated after reporting flu-like symptoms at a Braintree medical facility. And at Logan Airport, five passengers experiencing flu-like symptoms aboard a flight from Dubai were taken to area hospitals. \nBoth cases were false alarms. But Joseph Sullivan, the mayor of Braintree, said local officials need better guidelines for how to respond to potential cases. “We need a comprehensive plan,” he told the panel of lawmakers. “There will be a next event.”Public health officials have sought to ease concerns by noting that Ebola is spread through direct contact with bodily fluids such as blood and vomit and can’t be contracted through the air or by water. Earlier this week, Governor Deval Patrick and public health officials emphasized . On Thursday, Cheryl Bartlett, the state’s public health commissioner, said the risk of cases remains low. “It is highly unlikely that we will see any widespread transmission of Ebola in Massachusetts,” she said at the hearing. “While Ebola is a very serious disease, it is one that health experts — and our medical community here in Massachusetts — understand and are prepared for.” The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has stepped up screening at US airports that receive most travelers from West Africa. There are no approved vaccines or treatments, and the death rate in the African outbreak has climbed to 70 percent.Paul Biddinger, medical director of emergency department operations at Massachusetts General Hospital, said that while hospitals have been training for emerging infectious diseases for years, Ebola raises new complications. “We do not have any other disease in the US that poses such challenges,” he told lawmakers. “This is not something we do every day.” Biddinger said all health centers need to question any patients showing Ebola symptoms about their recent travel history, noting the virus’s incubation period ranges from two to 21 days. They should have designated rooms to isolate patients, and a trained staff who have “gone through multiple exercises,” he said.But Higgins and other nurses said training has been poor, and called for immediate action to bring staff up to speed. “Proper preparation means interactive training and live drills,” she said. “It is essential that we take the correct and necessary actions now. The disease is not going to wait for us to catch up.” State Senator Marc Pacheco, a Taunton Democrat, said hospitals and clinics need to establish standard requirements to prepare for and handle Ebola cases. \n“If we don’t have a protocol in place that embraces the very best standards, we’re only looking for problems,” he said. “Certainly there is a cost, but the cost of inaction is far greater.”
IT’S 6 P.M. Wednesday, and the IBEW Hall on Freeport Street in Dorchester is buzzing with volunteers who are working for Martha Coakley at the behest of Boston Mayor Marty Walsh.Megan Costello, who headed Walsh’s mayoral campaign, is leading a “woman-to-woman persuasion training” session. Around her, dozens of volunteers are making calls. Their targets are independent, or so-called unenrolled, Boston voters.\n\t\nCostello, on leave from her Walsh administration job, rattles off numbers. Since Sept. 29, some 150 Boston volunteers have made 100,000 telephone calls and knocked on nearly 25,000 doors. But Costello knows the numbers mean nothing unless they add up to a Coakley victory. “We know where every single vote is. We just have to chase it,” said Costello.What’s happening in one union hall on one night is a small piece of the vaunted statewide get-out-the-vote operation that Democrat John Walsh put together for Deval Patrick in 2006. It has been working smoothly ever since for Democrats from Barack Obama to Elizabeth Warren. Now the test is whether it will also work for Coakley.Walsh, no relation to the mayor, insists he’s not worried about the get-out-the-vote machine Republicans claim to be building for Charlie Baker. Republicans, said Walsh, identify “data.” Democrats identify people who vote for Democrats.However, Baker is trying to tweak the usual Republican election formula by  like Lowell, Lawrence, Springfield, and Boston. He last week went to Blue Hill Avenue to announce an urban agenda. “It doesn’t cause me to worry so much,” said Walsh. “What it does for us is make people step up their game.”Coakley needs a stepped-up machine. Some Democrats, like Quincy Mayor Thomas Koch, are , and there are troubling signs of waffling by others. Former attorney general Tom Reilly is supposedly supporting Coakley — yet he still  for an ad that claims Baker outsourced jobs as chief executive of insurer Harvard Pilgrim Health Care.The downtown business crowd, , the ex-chairman of Partners HealthCare, is firmly with Baker. Democrats say that’s good for fund-raising and headlines, but it’s no substitute for hard-core, grass-roots organizing. “The part that is underappreciated,” said Walsh. “is the mechanical piece of collecting all the elements of our coalition that make it work on election day.”That is, put together campaign organizations for all the Democratic candidates on the statewide ticket. Add in congressional and state legislative candidates. Throw in popular, high-profile Democratic officeholders — from Patrick to Walsh — and turn out voters for Coakley on election day.Or so the Democratic election equation usually goes.Since primary day, Patrick has been  of the Coakley campaign effort, . At first, Mayor Walsh played coy, saying he thought Baker would be a good governor. But, in the end, the mayor , and his supporters say they are now working hard for Coakley.“When the mayor endorsed Martha Coakley, that told me that was his focus,” said Dan Manning, another Marty Walsh loyalist who showed up last week at the IBEW hall. Baker signs in Boston don’t scare Manning: “They look great in windows. They don’t vote,” he said.Still, political machines can deliver only so much. Warren Tolman, Walsh’s pick for attorney general, lost Boston to rival Maura Healey  Maybe that’s not so bad, given that Tolman lost the overall primary by a huge 62 to 38 percent margin.Labor is a key part of Mayor Walsh’s coalition. But union leaders can’t guarantee rank-and-file votes. Unions backed Coakley in her 2010 loss to Republican Scott Brown, but  taken after the election showed that members voted for Brown over Coakley.Ultimately, however, what fires up voters is not a machine. It’s an inspirational candidate. Coakley is no Patrick; neither is Baker. That reality is probably harder on Coakley, though, since Democrats expect more poetry from their candidates.“Is Martha Coakley or the Democratic Party perfect? No,” said Costello. “But in my heart of hearts, I believe government is good and does good things for people. That’s who Marty is, and that’s why he’s with Martha.”Now she and the Walsh machine must get a large number of Boston voters to reach the same conclusion — and turn out for Coakley on election day.
Next time you’re trying to squeeze onto a Silver Line bus or find yourself stuck behind a conga line of cars on A Street, know this: there’s a group furiously trying to keep everyone moving on the South Boston Waterfront.This high-powered collection of city, state, and business leaders have rolled up their sleeves for much of this year to come up with ways to ease the gridlock in a district that is growing faster than anyone can imagine. \n\t\nThe growth is staggering. Between , the number of people living in the area surged 61 percent to more than 10,800, and employment jumped 27 percent to 36,500 workers. This group, spearheaded by business-led , has a good handle on how people are getting around and where the bottlenecks are now. Now they’re culling through more than 100 ideas to come up with recommendations on how to improve commutes.So what’s bubbling to the top of the list? The need for more public transit, opening up the restricted South Boston Bypass Road, extending the Silver Line tunnel under D Street, getting the Postal Service to open up its section of Dorchester Avenue, consolidating private shuttle buses, traveling by boats and ferries.Wow, a lot to digest. That’s exactly how I felt after  and the technical (!) related to what’s being called the South Boston Waterfront Sustainable Transportation Plan. But really, it’s exciting because you get the sense this is a group that gets business and means business, with folks zeroing in on real-time solutions, not just hazy ideas that might be put in place years later. Here are some highlights: \nPeople who work in the South Boston Waterfront like to drive, they really do.  found that about 53 percent of the district’s employees drive alone to work. compared with 31 percent who take public transit. For workers in Boston neighborhoods with better public transit, such as the Back Bay and Chinatown, the numbers are reversed, with about 35 percent driving and up to 55 percent taking public transit. Seaport workers are attached to their cars because thanks to the Big Dig, the area has great access to the Mass. Pike and Interstate 93. And despite all the new buildings going up, there’s still plenty of parking that’s cheaper than what you’ll find in the Financial District.One idea that has long been talked about is opening the  to the public. Now, only commercial trucks can use the 1.1-mile road that connects the waterfront with South Bay. But we really have to ask ourselves why truckers can’t share the road. The  gathered by A Better City show truck traffic — during peak hours, no less — has declined sharply since 2000 when construction companies used it during the Big Dig. Here’s an idea. I’ve learned rush hour for the bypass road doesn’t coincide when other routes are busiest. For example, the morning peak is between 9 a.m. and 10 a.m., and the evening rush is 3 p.m. to 4 p.m. Why not let the rest of us use the bypass from 7 a.m. to 9 a.m., and 5 p.m. to 7 p.m.? The Massachusetts Port Authority has been working closely with truckers who use the road to ferry goods to and from the port, and from the maritime industrial area.  “Let’s have it be data driven,” said Massport chief Tom Glynn of changes to the road. Still, he added that any plan “has to work for the trucking community first.”Another possibility is to open up Dorchester Avenue in front of the Postal Service’s building along Fort Point Channel. That stretch is restricted for post office use only. I was down there the other day and salivated at the idea of being able to drive down Dorchester Avenue from South Boston straight into the Fort Point area, which is fast becoming a hot spot for restaurants. For a decade, the state has been trying to get the  from that location so it can expand South Station. The two sides are still locked in negotiations. Would it be possible to just open up Dot Ave. before a deal is done? A Postal Service official tells me no — the road needs to be restricted out of concerns for security and safety. First, they won’t move. Now they won’t let us use their road. What does the post office have against the Commonwealth?There might not be consensus on how to ease traffic on the streets, but everyone agrees on public transit. The Seaport District needs more of it. “It seems to be universally accepted that public transit is going to be a linchpin to the improvement in the area,” said Jim Gillooly, interim Boston transportation commissioner. So how is the Silver Line doing in moving people in and out of the district? That’s the rapid bus service that functions as the area’s chief public transit option. With the explosion of workers, the Silver Line is at capacity or over capacity during rush hour when there’s a bus coming every two minutes, according to A Better City’s report. The MBTA also runs three regular bus lines in the district, and it’s hard to find a seat on the Route 7 bus, which serves the Seaport, during peak travel times.As , don’t expect the state to just expand the Silver Line. That’s because the original manufacturer went out of business years ago. The state is in the process of refurbishing the current fleet of Silver Line buses, and the prospect of new — or more — buses is years away. Knowing the Silver Line can get packed, especially with the Government Center T stop temporarily closed, Massport launched a bus service in April that takes people from the Back Bay to Logan Airport. Massport has a vested interest in this because it owns the Silver Line buses that go from South Station to Logan, and it doesn’t want passengers missing flights. The $5 Back Bay Logan Express runs every 20 minutes and ferries about 800 people daily, though Massport chief Glynn tells me he hopes that will grow to about 1,000. Now what about that , the one Transportation Secretary Richard Davey trumpeted a year ago? It would take advantage of an old track that could connect the Fort Point Channel to Back Bay Station. Please don’t shoot the messenger, but the Track 61 train is still coming; it’s just delayed like one of our commuter trains on a freezing winter day. Instead of arriving next year, try 2019. “I was definitely optimistic,” explained Davey. Here’s what happened. Davey was counting on a new shipment of a more affordable rail car known as a diesel multiple unit, or DMU. The state has the money, but the soonest the cars can be delivered is 2018.It’s too bad because Jim Rooney, who runs the Massachusetts Convention Center Authority,  had started to squirrel away $20 million to build a Seaport District Station just outside the Southie convention center. Obviously, that plan is on hold. “I remain an enthusiastic supporter of creating the connection between the convention center, the waterfront, and the Back Bay,” said Rooney, but “I am not building a $20 million station to nowhere.”This is a town where we rarely agree on anything, but here we’re seeing eye to eye: Public transit is desperately needed in what has become a crown jewel of our region. So please take note, new governor, whoever you are.
“Fury” takes place in the waning days of World War II, but as a film it’s stuck somewhere between the present and the past — between the gung-ho platitudes of every WWII movie before 1996’s “Saving Private Ryan” and the chaos and carnage of every WWII movie since. As Sergeant Don “Wardaddy” Collier, the battle-scarred leader of a tank squad pushing through Germany toward Berlin, Brad Pitt creates a warrior who is terse, sometimes noble, more often brutal. The movie as a whole tries to balance the standard veneration of the Greatest Generation with an acknowledgment that what war does to men is the opposite of great. You could call it “Glorious Bastards” and you wouldn’t be far off.Above all, writer-director David Ayer wants to push our faces in the violent actuality of combat and its aftermath. “Wait’ll you see it — what a man can do to another man,” one of the tank crew says to its newest bow gunner, Private Norman Ellison (Logan Lerman). Since Ellison has just scraped a portion of his predecessor’s face off the inside of the tank, he needs little convincing.\n\t\nIn the old days of “Pork Chop Hill” and other dog-face classics, Ellison would be called The Kid. Eight weeks into the Army, he’s the audience’s surrogate, our fellow naïf among men who’ve been fighting from one end of each day to the other since the war’s early engagements in the African desert. The other members of the crew are the tank’s scripture-quoting gunner, Corporal Boyd Swan (Shia LeBeouf, quietly effective); its country-boy assistant gunner, Private Grady Travis (Jon Bernthal); and its Hispanic driver, Technician Trini Garcia (Michael Peña). In the old movies, they’d be called Holy Joe, Tex, and Mex, with Pitt their grizzled Sgt. Rock.But the old movies were less interested in showing the barbarism of war, the death that can come out of nowhere at any instant, and what invading armies — even the good ones — do to a country. “Fury” gives us terrible glimpses: tank treads rolling over a body pancaked into the mud, an elderly woman cutting meat off a dead horse, a woman in a wedding dress among a crowd of refugees.The battle violence is similarly harrowing, and its effect on the men in the Sherman tank with “FURY” painted crudely on its barrel is unsettling and uncertain. Ayer, who has dealt with charismatic bad boys before — he wrote the script for “Training Day” and directed the sharp police drama “End of Watch” — makes the paternal “Wardaddy” into a figure both monstrous and upstanding. In one scene, he shoots a captured enemy officer in the back. A few scenes later, he’s protecting two German women from being assaulted by his own men.The latter sequence is the agonizing midpoint of “Fury” and, along with a pitched fight between four American tanks and one superior German Tiger, it’s the film’s dramatic highlight. The two women are an aunt (Anamaria Marinca, star of the great Romanian movie “4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days”) and her teenage niece (Alicia Von Rittberg, “Barbara”), and they know exactly how precarious their situation is when the Americans arrive in town. Ayer lets the sergeant be the moral arbiter, urging the virginal Ellison into a bedroom with the girl while keeping the drooling, devolved Travis from a potential orgy of rape and murder. In the curious calculus of “Fury,” women are the spoils of war but only if you give them respect and fresh eggs.Pitt gives a fine, believably bleak performance, despite the slowly tightening noose of heroism around his neck. When the young Ellison protests that shooting the unarmed German is wrong and his “Wardaddy” responds, “We’re not here for right or wrong. We’re here to kill him,” “Fury” approaches the cauterizing honesty of a Sam Fuller war film. (By contrast, when Collier opines, “Ideals are peaceful — history is violent,” that’s the sound of Ayer breathing hot air.)“Fury” tries to have it both ways, with a climactic siege of the lone tank by an entire Nazi battalion that wipes away the nihilism of the preceding two hours in a burst of patriotic duty and Steven Price’s hollow, rousing soundtrack music. It’s not that you don’t believe it. It’s that the earlier scenes, showcasing the sheer grind of armed conflict and the way it can scrape civilization off the best of men (and forget about the worst), are more convincing. “Fury” wants to lead us to a fresh consideration of “the good war” while simultaneously celebrating the old bromides and clichés. No wonder it shoots itself in the tank.\n\n
Medical practices around the state face an unnerving possibility: that a patient with Ebola symptoms could show up first at the doctor’s office, not the hospital.It happened Sunday when a man who had recently traveled to Liberia went to a Braintree group practice, complaining of a headache and body aches. The highly publicized response, which turned out to be a false alarm, underscored that the front line of medical care is not always the emergency room.\n\t\nThe episode at Harvard Vanguard Medical Associates was “the wake-up call that probably much of the state, if not the country, needed,” said Jamie Barber, chief executive of Compass Medical, a multispecialty practice with eight Massachusetts locations.But doctors in private practice have had little guidance from health officials on how best to protect staff and patients without fueling needless fears about a virus that is unlikely to threaten most Americans.It was not until Wednesday that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention put out  specific to office-based practices.The Massachusetts Department of Public Health has posted information for all clinicians about  and  of patients on its website, and it has reached out to such groups as the Massachusetts Medical Society and community health centers, according to a spokesman. But it has not directly sought to engage primary-care doctors, who are making their own way in developing protocols.“The state hasn’t put out any phone calls or alerts,” said Dr. George M. Abraham, associate chief of medicine at St. Vincent Hospital in Worcester and governor of the Massachusetts chapter of the American College of Physicians. “They’re focusing on getting the hospitals prepped, which is fair enough. Hospitals are much more likely to have a seriously ill patient.”On Wednesday, the Massachusetts Nurses Association said that those preparations were inadequate to protect nurses who might screen for and treat possible Ebola cases.Abraham, an infectious disease specialist, has been fielding calls from primary care doctors who are seeking advice. He recently heard from one whose staff was wearing gloves and masks and taking every patient’s temperature upon arrival. The doctor asked if he was doing enough. Abraham told him he was doing too much and risked making patients feel unwelcome.Harvard Vanguard, which declined to discuss Sunday’s incident, handled the patient with Ebola-like symptoms by calling in a hazmat team and an ambulance and temporarily shutting the building. The patient was taken to Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, where it was determined he did not have Ebola.“Harvard Vanguard erred on the side of caution,” Abraham said, predicting that others would do the same. “Nobody wants to be blamed over not having done enough.”Starting this week, Abraham’s seven-doctor practice in Worcester, a city with a sizable Liberian population, began asking patients who call with certain symptoms, such as fever or diarrhea, whether they traveled recently to West Africa. So far, no one has said yes, but if patients had, they would probably have been advised to go to the hospital, he said.At the Tru-Med Walk-In Center in Fall River, Dr. Robert S. Crausman and his colleagues recently mapped out their Ebola response plans, mindful of the large Liberian population in nearby Rhode Island. They packaged together the personal protective equipment that is normally available — gloves, gowns, masks, face shields, and booties — so it can be grabbed quickly if needed.A patient who had been in West Africa and who arrived at Tru-Med with Ebola-like symptoms would be moved immediately to an exam room, and the nurse or doctor responsible for the patient’s care would be notified.“Once the patient is in the room, you have some time to think about what to do next,” Crausman said. The next step would probably be to call state health officials.“What we’re not going to do is call 911 and throw everybody out,” Crausman said. “I’m pretty sure that the ophthalmologist next door and the hardware store next door will not be evacuated.”For Dr. Harvey Clermont, a retired surgeon who runs three free clinics, in Worcester and Shrewsbury, the Ebola threat poses a special challenge. His evening clinics, staffed by volunteers and serving people without health insurance, are held in churches, not well-equipped medical centers — and one has primarily African patients.About three weeks ago, using guidance provided by St. Vincent Hospital, Clermont’s clinics adopted protocols: Evaluate patients based on symptoms and travel history, put those with possible Ebola in a room apart from others, and call a hospital for advice on whether to send the patient to the emergency room.Still, he said, “Everybody is nervous about it,” and he plans to hold meetings before next week’s clinics with volunteers. He is also ordering gowns, gloves, masks, and face shields.James W. Hunt Jr., president of the Massachusetts League of Community Health Centers, said the state’s 49 community facilities are encouraging patients to contact them first if they feel ill or have questions. The league, he said, is forwarding alerts and guidelines from the CDC to health centers and is surveying them to find out how each is responding.Manet Community Health Center, with six sites in Quincy, Hull, and Taunton, has experienced an increase in phone calls from worried patients and is working to allay fears at community events and through social media. “We are debunking myths and putting people at ease,” chief executive John Holiver said.Abraham, the Worcester infectious disease specialist, did see one bright side to the worries.“It’s easier to convince people to take the flu shot now than it was in past years,” he said, even though most understand that the flu shot will not protect against Ebola.“It’s just the general fear of more virulent viruses,” he said. “We’re running out of flu shot faster than we can get it in.”\n
Of the five candidates running for governor of Massachusetts, Republican Charlie Baker is the only one who explicitly mentions welfare reform as a campaign issue.He is the only one to issue specific “welfare reform priorities.” He is the only candidate to mention welfare in his campaign ads. A recent pro-Baker super PAC spot even points out that his Democratic opponent, Martha Coakley “still has no plan to fix welfare.”\n\t\nMany of the reforms Baker says he wants — including mandatory job training for adults on public aid, reducing benefit extensions, and raising the work requirement exemption age to 66 — were approved this summer by the Legislature. And work requirements for welfare recipients, which Baker also touts, have been in place since the 1990s.“Look, when you’re a candidate, you make proposals on lots of things,” Baker said in an interview. “It’s important to make clear to people that I’m going to be enthusiastic proponent of implementing the reforms.”But critics say Baker’s focus on welfare is aimed at solidifying support from his conservative base — and an effort to appeal directly to disaffected voters resentful of those receiving public assistance.“I’ve been doing this 42 years, which means I’ve seen every iteration of political people and operator thinking if they can slam poor people on welfare it seems to help their votes,” said John Drew, president of the Boston antipoverty organization ABCD. “I’m seeing that now, and I’m not happy with it.”Welfare reform is an issue that voters who identify themselves as Baker supporters care deeply about — even if the general public does not rank it as a top issue, according to recent polls.“People who are focused on the welfare system are people who are more likely to vote for Baker,” said Steve Koczela, president of MassINC Polling Group which conducts polls for WBUR.A recent MassINC/WBUR poll asked voters how they would respond to a candidate who made welfare reform a major priority. Seventy percent of those supporting Baker said they would be “much more likely” to vote for the candidate. By comparison, 41 percent of voters supporting Coakley answered the same way.Of the seven campaign issues voters were asked to rank in a recent poll by the University of Massachusetts Amherst and WBZ, welfare reform came in at No. 7 with 4 percent.Still, one in eight families in Massachusetts is touched by a variety of public aid programs, according to the state. The Transitional Aid to Families with Dependent Children program —commonly called  welfare — provided aid to 42,888 families in August, the lowest number in the past five years.Kevin Peterson, director of the voter initiative New Democracy Coalition and a Baker supporter, said Baker’s approach to welfare reform is “a very earnest and sympathetic approach to addressing the needs of poor people.”And while Peterson thinks his candidate is serious, he also said, “I think voters across the Commonwealth must hold him entirely accountable around creating jobs for low-income people because absent of jobs, welfare reform makes absolutely no sense.”For Baker, welfare reform is not a new issue, though the tone of his pitch has softened. During his 2010 campaign against Governor Deval Patrick, Baker created fake electronic benefit cards that said: “Deval Patrick’s Massachusetts EBT Welfare Card. Swipe me for booze, cash, cigarettes, and/or lottery tickets at taxpayers’ expense” — an effort seen as belittling to those who rely on public assistance.“I regret a lot of things I did last time,” Baker has said, the faux EBT card among them.Instead, this year’s campaign includes one television advertisement in which Baker, talking with his 17-year-old daughter, says: “We can make Massachusetts great and create jobs by controlling spending, lowering taxes, and requiring work for welfare.”A second Baker ad, also airing in Spanish, shows Baker laughing with patrons in a barbershop, fist-bumping a little girl, and walking with former governor William F. Weld, as a narrator says he “got people off welfare and made Massachusetts first in jobs.”And the pro-Baker super PAC ad touted his “plan” to clamp down on “widespread welfare abuse.”Baker’s  opponents describe this as political posturing. Asked about their own welfare reform priorities, they talk mainly about reducing poverty, with measured mentions of stopping fraud and abuse.  Coakley’s campaign, for instance, notes her plans for reform include punishing stores found to have committed EBT fraud by removing their ability to sell alcohol, tobacco, and lottery tickets. Her campaign said, “She believes we need to go further; we need to ensure that every person is able to get on the ladder and lift themselves up.”Baker talks about this too, pushing for an increase to the earned income tax credit, which economists say is an effective way to help low-income families. But he also talks about welfare rules.Last month, he traveled to Worcester to promote a controversial program that limits how long residents can remain in public housing if they’re not working or in school. And in May, when he released his “welfare reform priorities,” Baker declared that “for too long, transitional assistance has created a culture of dependence.”Politicians, political analysts, and advocates who are critical of Baker’s focus say it is little more than a plan to get elected on the backs of poor women and children.“What he’s trying to do, as you well know, is say ‘I’m a manager, and the Commonwealth has been mismanaged over the last couple of years, and I’m going to come and clean up,’\u2009” said state Representative Thomas Conroy, chairman of the Joint Committee on Labor and Workforce Development. “The point is, with welfare there’s nothing to clean up. We have reformed this thing to death. What’s missing is money. What’s left to do is fund the programs — workforce training, GED, ESOL training, childcare.”Amid political campaigns, debates about welfare can become highly partisan and inextricably linked to issues of race and class. Researchers say much of that tension pivots on perceptions of poverty and who is deserving of assistance.They note that since the days of Ronald Reagan’s 1976 presidential campaign speech vilifying a welfare abuser in Chicago, a narrative has emerged that associates African-Americans with public aid\n.“It’s a way to divide the electorate by racial and ethnic lines,” said James Jennings, a noted specialist in race, politics, and urban policy at Tufts University who wrote a book on welfare reform. “In some people’s mind, when you say ‘welfare reform’ it’s people, families of color, black and Latino women. So .\xa0.\xa0.  it’s a message. It’s a way to blame the other.”Tim Buckley, a Baker campaign spokesman, objected to the assertion that the push for welfare reform contained racial overtones. The campaign is trying to appeal to a wide swath of voters, Democrats in urban corridors, suburban independents, and conservative, party faithful. “I’ve been chasing 100 percent of the vote since I got in this race,” Baker said. “And I’ve built my campaign around policies and proposals that I think can make Massachusetts better — better for everybody.”
Winter often transforms Boston City Hall Plaza into a deserted wasteland, forcing pedestrians to slip-slide cautiously over the ice-encrusted expanse of red brick. This year, however, the city may play to the plaza’s strength.Officials are contemplating a large ice skating rink to invigorate the seven-acre plaza, which has long been this city’s most maligned public space. It could become Boston’s own Rockefeller Center, with couples skating arm-in-arm in the glow of lights from City Hall.\n\t\nThink about hockey games, and hot cocoa vendors, and a Government Center Zamboni to keep the ice smooth.“The vision is to bring City Hall Plaza something that people can use during the wintertime when it’s desolate,” said Ken Brissette, Boston’s director of tourism, sports, and entertainment. “We like the idea.”The seasonal rink has been under discussion since May and is in the early stages of securing permits, Brissette said. It would be a city-sponsored amenity constructed and managed by Anthem Entertainment, a Boston company. The rink could operate from mid-November through February or March, depending on weather.City kids would skate for free and adults would pay a fee, Brissette said. There would be hockey games and concessions, Brissette said, although he did not have specifics about food and drinks.“The city is excited about this up and down, and we’re excited about it,” said Chris Sinclair, president of Anthem Entertainment. “But we’re still dotting the i’s and crossing the t’s.”The initiative still needs a slew of permits from city agencies and sign-off by an engineer that the plaza could support the weight of the rink. Brissette said the city was still seeking financing and could not accurately estimate a cost.“This is not a done deal,” he said. “We hope it’s going to happen. We’ll probably know that within a week or two.”The ice rink is part of a larger effort by Mayor Martin J. Walsh’s administration to enliven the plaza. This summer, an enthusiastic crowd spun in circles at a Donna Summer Memorial Roller Disco Tribute Party, paying homage to the late singer from Dorchester. Outdoor broadcasts of World Cup matches drew thousands.This weekend on the plaza, 25 snowboarders are scheduled to compete on a half-pipe lined with special man-made snow pellets trucked from Kentucky.The proposed City Hall Plaza skating rink could draw customers from the Frog Pond, an iconic outdoor skating rink on Boston Common. The Frog Pond is just a half-mile from City Hall Plaza. Since 2010, it has been operated by the Skating Club of Boston, which has a contract through winter 2019-2020 to lease the space from the city.“Our mission is to promote interest in the sport of figure skating,” said Doug Zeghibe, executive director of the Skating Club of Boston. “It is a great thing when there is more figure skating going on in the city.”The Frog Pond uses proceeds from skating receipts to underwrite year-round programing, such as yoga, a pumpkin festival, and movie nights, Zeghibe said. The City Hall Plaza rink would be close, Zeghibe said, but it would be difficult to estimate the impact on business until it opened.City officials said they believe enough skaters exist for both.“We’re not trying to take business away from the Frog Pond,” Brissette said. “It’s in a different area. It’s in a different neighborhood. It will serve different people. The Frog Pond will always be the Frog Pond.”Zeghibe agreed the Frog Pond has an unparalleled setting.“Boston Common is a beautiful, idyllic setting with the trees and with the lights and the perspective on the city,” Zeghibe said. “It’s a pretty magical place to skate. The City Hall experience would be very different.”Magic? On City Hall Plaza? That usually comes in spring, when the Big Apple Circus raises its big top on the red bricks.
\n\n\nyears, the Kurds have been warning the world about the Islamic State.Accusations by the Kurds that Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar support jihadists in Syria were dismissed as conspiracy theories . The son of Salih Muslim, the co-president of the Democratic Union Party, or PYD, in Rojava — the Kurdish region in northern Syria — was killed fighting ISIS in 2013, nearly a year before the rest of the world even heard about the militant group.

4807,Jo Ractliffe,"""The number of working-age adults in Massachusetts with at least a bachelor’s degree will top out in 2020 before declining over the next decade, according to new projections that raise concerns about labor shortages in a state that thrives on knowledge-based industries.A report scheduled to be released Monday by , an independent Boston think tank, and the \nforecasts that between 2020 and 2030 the number of adults ages 25 to 64 with a bachelor’s degree or higher will drop by about 46,000 statewide, or by about 3 percent, after rising a projected 61 percent between 1990 and 2020.\n\t\nThe report attributes the predicted shift to two key reasons: As the baby boom generation retires, it will be replaced by younger generations that are simply smaller in numbers; and after two decades of rapid growth, the rate of increase in educational attainment of state residents is slowing and will eventually start to decline.For the first time since the US Census Bureau began reporting educational attainment in 1940, Massachusetts will end a decade with fewer prime working-age college-educated residents than it had at the start of the decade, said the study, which received financial backing from the Barr Foundation.“Massachusetts has had the luxury of having exceptional growth for decade after decade but it’s not going to come as easy for us as it has in the past,” said Benjamin Forman, research director at MassINC. “When you look at these data it’s clear we’re entering a new era. We haven’t confronted this kind of challenge before, and it’s an issue we have to pay close attention to.”Certain parts of the state will see more significant changes than others.The report predicts that between 2010 and 2030, the number of working-age adults with a bachelor’s degree or higher will fall by 41 percent on Cape Cod; 27 percent in the Pioneer Valley; and 9 percent in the Berkshires.Meanwhile, the rest of the state will see gains of 1 percent in the southeast region; 5 percent in the northeast region; 9 percent in Central Massachusetts; and 10 percent in both the Metrowest region and in Greater Boston.Some experts believe that a slowdown in the growth of college-educated workers would be a positive shift, citing research that says there already are not enough quality jobs to meet the large supply of degree-holding workers.However, others contend the dearth of quality jobs is mostly a product of the recent recession. As conditions improve, employers will struggle to find well-educated workers to fill openings, some experts say.Linda Noonan, executive director of the Massachusetts Business Alliance for Education, said her organization surveyed nearly 400 employers this fall and more than two-thirds of them said they are having trouble finding people with the right skills to fill open positions.\n“Clearly Massachusetts needs and is going to continue to need workers with postsecondary degrees,” she said. “When we see educational attainment is dropping, that’s a cause for concern.”Massachusetts has the nation’s largest percentage of residents 25 and older who hold a bachelors degree or higher and, according to the report, the state saw a dramatic spike in that population between 1990 and 2010. Migration to the state was a key reason for the growth, accounting for more than half of the increase during that span.But the report’s authors said they do not believe that migration will necessarily continue. Individual tastes, rising costs of living, and immigration policies could affect the flow of people moving to Massachusetts.And, while educational attainment rose overall in the state during the past two decades, growth in bachelor’s degree attainment has lagged for African-American and Latino residents, the report found.Forman said greater efforts should be made to eliminate those racial and ethnic disparities and to increase educational attainment for all.“If we addressed those issues, it would go a long way to providing the human talent that employers are going to need that we built our economy around today,” he said.\nState Higher Education Commissioner Richard Freeland said his office plans to unveil a report with similar findings later this month and will outline recommendations — including investing more in public higher education — that the state should follow to increase educational attainment.“We live and breathe by our supply of college-educated workers.” Freeland said. “Closing achievement gaps and raising graduation rates will go a long way toward solving this issue.”""",

Before voting to give himself a $20,000 raise, City Councilor Tito Jackson lamented his current salary of $87,500 and said public service should not be a “subscription to poverty.” City Councilor Charles Yancey said he was amazed his wife had not divorced him because he was paid so little. The proposed pay hike would push Jackson and Yancey into one of the highest income brackets in their districts. With a salary of $107,500, they would each earn more than 8 out of 10 of the households in their districts, which consist largely of Roxbury and Mattapan.\n\t\nMayor Martin J. Walsh has threatened to veto the raise; he has until mid-October to do so.  If he doesn’t veto the measure, the raises begin in January 2016.City council members will individually earn more than 68 percent of the households they represent, if the pay raise they approved for themselves on September 8 goes through. In some neighborhoods the divide is even greater, like in Jackson and Yancey’s.About 32 percent of households in Boston have a shared annual income of more than $100,000, according to census figures. City councilmembers voted last week to join this group by increasing their pay $20,000. The combined household income for most councillors are unknown as only Michael Flaherty recently filed a financial disclosure statement. Boston’s city council members can also have a second job while serving.“In my mind, public service shouldn’t be a subscription to poverty,” said Councilor Tito Jackson before the vote. “I think it’s absolutely important that people who do this work are justly compensated.”It should be noted that the poverty threshold for a family of four is about $24,000. Jackson represents District 7 in Boston, where 84 percent of households make less than $100,000. In Boston’s District 4, which is represented by Yancey, 81 percent of households make less  than $100,000, as well. Neither councilors returned phone calls.\nCouncilors Matt O’Malley and Josh Zakim were the only non-At-Large representatives who voted against the raise. The districts the pair represent have the highest percentage of households making more than $100,000 with District 6 at 48 percent and District 8 at 53 percent.O’Malley and Councilor Ayanna Pressley, who also voted against the raise, suggested council salary should rise and fall with Boston’s median income. According to the census, the median family income for the Boston-Cambridge-Quincy metro area was $91,537 in 2013. In 2006, the last time the council got a raise, the median family income was higher at $92,703 after adjusting for inflation. \n
Working to strengthen their support in communities of color, Martha Coakley and Charlie Baker met separately Monday with the Black Ministerial Alliance of Greater Boston.After the closed-door meetings at Twelfth Baptist Church in Roxbury, Coakley said she had spoken with the group about a range of issues, from boosting educational opportunities to supporting programs aimed at helping boys and young men of color get ahead.\n\t\nCoakley, who attended the meeting with Governor Deval Patrick, offered a knock on her Republican opponent, saying, in essence, she would invest more in early education and other programs than he would. “That’s a big difference between me and my Republican opponent: I’m going to invest in people, I’m going to give them the job skills, and we’re going to see Boston and every neighborhood in the whole state be prosperous and fair,” she said.Baker, who has held a number of campaign events in communities of color that traditionally vote Democratic, said he spoke about his “,” which includes an emphasis on expanding educational and economic opportunity and public safety in cities around the state.Asked about Coakley’s criticisms, Baker said many people in the community have gotten a chance to know him over the course of his campaign and he’s gotten to know them.He said “many of our proposals with respect to economic development, and educational excellence and community building are quite consistent with what the folks in this community would like to see happen.”Patrick, speaking to members of the news media after Coakley departed, said he thanked the Alliance for the good work they have done together over the years and “that the best person to carry on that work, in my view, without equivocation, is Martha Coakley.”He was also critical of Baker, whom he beat in the bitter 2010 gubernatorial race.Asked about Baker making many appearances in urban areas, Patrick offered a quick reply.“Good for him,” Patrick said. “I really, really believe that it’s important for candidates to appeal to voters everywhere.”But, the governor said, “showing up is one thing, governing on their behalf is a different one.”He indicated that some of Baker’s policy positions were not in line with the interests of people in the community. “We’ve heard about cutting taxes, which is always a great one-liner, but we haven’t heard about the programs that will be cut when those revenues go away,” Patrick said. “And you know what programs are going to go away, they’re the ones without the loudest constituencies.”Patrick praised Coakley. “When she’s here, she’s here not just for the votes, but on behalf of the voters,” he said. “That’s a real difference.”Evan Falchuk, one of three independent candidates for governor, also met with the Black Ministerial Alliance. Before his meeting, he told reporters he was looking forward to discussing with clergy issues such as “problems of racism and prejudice, the inequalities that continue to exist in terms of educational opportunities and job opportunities.”The Alliance describes itself as “an alliance of over 80 faith-based and community-based organizations with a 40+ year history of serving the Black community in Boston.”Coakley and Baker aides said they did not expect the group to offer an endorsement in the gubernatorial contest.Also running for governor are independent candidates Jeff McCormick and Scott Lively. A McCormick spokesman said the candidate would have been happy to meet with the group, but was not invited. In a text message, Lively said he was not invited either.The election is Nov. 4.
\n\t\nPolice are investigating a stabbing in Dorchester over the weekend that left one woman dead. At about 4:45 a.m. Saturday morning, Boston police received a call about a fight in progress at 188 Washington St. Upon arrival, officers observed a female victim believed to be in her 20s who had suffered stab wounds that were considered to be life-threatening. The victim was transported to Boston Medical Center, where she later died, according to police. The Boston Police Homicide Unit is investigating the incident. 
 A railway company controlled by China’s government has emerged as the top bidder for a $566.6 million contract to supply the MBTA with new cars for the Red and Orange lines.The Massachusetts Department of Transportation Board of Directors is scheduled to vote Wednesday on the contract for CNR MA Corporation, which is a venture of China CNR Corporation Limited and CNR Changchun Railway Vehicles Co.\n\t\nChina CNR is owned by the People’s Republic of China.The contract calls for 284 subway cars and will include the construction of a plant to build the cars in Springfield, according to a person with knowledge of the procurement.The deal comes amid concerns from human rights activists about China’s record on human rights violations.But Governor Deval Patrick, in remarks to reporters outside a Monday event in Roxbury, insisted that the bidders on the MBTA contract have been “thoroughly vetted,” and that the process had been “transparent and rigorous and competitive.”Patrick noted the new cars would not be built in China.“The condition of the deal is that the coaches be assembled right here in Massachusetts,” he said.Patrick pledged to rebuild many of the aging cars in the Red and Orange line fleets a year ago, after the passage of the transportation funding bill set aside more money for public transit.Patrick is scheduled to make an announcement about the MBTA’s new Red and Orange line cars in Tuesday afternoon in Springfield. MBTA officials and Massachusetts Department of Transportation officials had no comment on the contract.
\n in Keene, N.H., provoked two equally incredulous reactions. First: Seriously — riots at a pumpkin festival? Second: Seriously — tear gas at a riot at a pumpkin festival? The college-age rioters may have truly believed they were just fighting for their right to party, and the police who responded may have honestly believed that Keene was on the brink of civil insurrection, but both badly need a reality check. The melee started on Saturday afternoon, during the middle of the city’s annual Pumpkin Festival, when a party at a house near the Keene State College campus spun out of control. Outmatched officers struggled to contain the disruption as it spilled onto nearby streets. Showing little respect for  or a community event meant to honor it, the rioters smashed windows, slashed tires, and overturned Dumpsters. Many of the rioters reportedly came from other schools; the next day, as Keene State became the object of national mockery,  from the college volunteered to clean up the mess.\n\t\nPrimary responsibility lies with the instigators, and Keene State College has . With plenty of video of the events, that probably won’t prove especially difficult. Reflecting the gravity of the situation, on Monday afternoon the governor of New Hampshire called for any other educational institutions whose students participated to hold them accountable as well. The best punishment would probably be to merely publish their names, ensuring that rioters will spend the next few years trying to explain any pumpkin-related indiscretions to future employers.  Still, rowdy students, sometimes displaying less than stellar judgement, are a stubborn fact of life on college campuses, and overreacting has its own dangers. The University of Massachusetts Amherst has faced a similar situation centered around the annual Blarney Blowout, which  this year. A  by former Boston police commissioner Edward F. Davis called for the police . “The donning of riot helmets and the use of chemical munitions had the effect of creating confusion and perpetuating the unruly behavior of the crowd,” the report found.Indeed, in the Keene case, the mere presence of advanced weaponry only seemed to aggravate the situation. “Bring out the BearCat,” the students reportedly chanted, referring to an armored vehicle owned by the Keene police. The Davis report on the Amherst disturbances should provide some guidance for Keene and other college towns, too. It turns out that over-armed police forces aren’t just a problem for those protesting police brutality against African-Americans in Missouri. Whether it’s at a demonstration in Ferguson or a Pumpkin Festival gone awry in Keene, police shouldn’t respond to civil unrest with weaponry out of a war zone. 
KEENE, N.H. — Several hundred students trooped across Keene State College campus Sunday morning carrying bags, buckets, and brooms in response to a Facebook post calling for volunteers to restore order after a night of chaos.“It’s part of my job as a student to help clean up whatever they created,” said freshman Skylar Sinde, 18, as he swept broken glass on Winchester Street, the site of Saturday’s violent confrontation just blocks from the annual Keene Pumpkin Festival.\n\t\nClad in red Keene State sweat shirts and caps, the crew moved in hours after hordes of young people taunted and threw bottles at police in riot gear, tearing across campus in a wave of vandalism that included overturning at least one car, smashing vehicle windows, slashing tires, tearing lampposts from their moorings, and flipping Dumpsters.Police responded with crowd-control measures that included tear gas, Tasers, and firing a weapon that appeared to shoot rubber bullets or pepper pellets into the crowd.Keene police declined to answer questions on Sunday about their tactics and about the number of injuries and arrests that took place Saturday, saying the city would issue a statement about the violence on Monday.The Cheshire Medical Center/Dartmouth-Hitchcock Keene saw about 26 patients Saturday who appeared to have been hurt during the fracas, according to spokesman Peter Malloy. All were treated for minor injuries and discharged, he said.\n\nThe patients had lacerations and various levels of alcohol intoxication, Malloy said.“This event does precipitate an increased amount of activity into the emergency room,” Malloy said. The medical center prepares for more activity on Pumpkin Festival weekend each year, he added, as the event “comes close to doubling the population, and we react as necessary.”Anne Huot, Keene State College president, released two statements Sunday condemning the “inexcusable behavior” of the vandals and bottle-throwers. She said that after reviewing photos and videos, school officials may expel Keene State students whose actions were deemed most serious.“To be clear, Keene State College does not tolerate the outrageous behavior that occurred over the weekend,” she said.The violence appeared to have started at a home on Blake Street, just off campus, according to Keene City Councilor James P. Duffy.Police were monitoring a particularly large party there Saturday afternoon when attendees began hurling bottles and other objects, hitting at least one person on the head and causing a laceration that led police to move in, Duffy said.Officers were “clearly outnumbered” throughout the riots, said Duffy, who credited police with showing restraint when faced with provocation.Keene police have a BearCat armored vehicle, and “students were standing in the street chanting, ‘Bring out the BearCat,’\u2009” Duffy said.Large parties have become frequent in the small city, taking place almost every weekend Keene State is in session, Duffy said. He said this has contributed to a “spring break-type atmosphere.”“It was no secret that police were going to take a more proactive approach this year,” Duffy said.However, Duffy said that though police were prepared for this year’s Pumpkin Festival, the size and unruliness of the crowd Saturday was unprecedented.“This is what happens when there’s a lot of pent-up energy, drugs, and alcohol,” Duffy said.The weekend riot bore similarities to last March’s Blarney Blowout at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, where police used aggressive tactics in dealing with an out-of-control off-campus party.\n\nOfficers in Amherst wore riot gear and shot pepper spray and sting balls at revelers, some of whom returned volleys of rocks and bottles.\nOn Blake Street Sunday morning, sophomore Ally McNamee was among a group of students using brooms, dustpans, snow shovels, and gloved hands to clean up the broken glass covering the roadway.McNamee and other volunteers expressed disgust with those responsible for the damage.“They’re so disrespectful,” the 19-year-old said. “It’s just so infuriating .\xa0.\xa0. especially because of the amount of people that you would ask, ‘Do you go here?’ and they would say, ‘No,’ and then you’re just like, ‘Would you leave?’\u2009”McNamee said she had called police to report several cases of vandalism she witnessed.Donna Mackey, 63, grew up on Blake Street and still has family living nearby. She now lives in nearby Roxbury, N.H., but returned on Sunday to see the damage. Mackey said she had been baffled at home Saturday night by news reports of riots at the college.“They say they’re rioting, and I think, ‘Against what?’\u2009” she said.Several students said most of the vandals appeared not to be enrolled at Keene State, which has an undergraduate enrollment of about 4,800. The students and other Keene residents said that in recent years the Pumpkin Festival has attracted a large group of young people from other local colleges and elsewhere who come to the city for the parties that occur during the festival weekend.Declan MacInnis, 18, a first time festival-goer who attends Plymouth State University, said he had observed but not participated in the damage.“It’s kind of sad how it got to that point,” MacInnis said. “It’s cool that people can come here and all celebrate together. .\xa0.\xa0. If we’re going to come from different schools, we should keep it peaceful.”In a parking lot where much of the vandalism occurred, a student approached Terry Blatti, and told her,“I just want to formally apologize for what happened.”Blatti, a Salisbury, Mass., resident who had come to enjoy the festival with her stepdaughter, was surveying the damage to her new Nissan Frontier, which had both driver’s side tires slashed, as well as dents and muddy footprints on the hood and roof.Blatti, 56, said she wasn’t angry, “just disappointed, I guess.” She did not blame Keene State or its students.“It wasn’t all college students,” she said. “It was such an influx of people that were here yesterday. It’s just that riot mentality.”\n
The leaves are turning. Scott Brown is driving his pickup truck. And Elizabeth Warren is on the attack against him.But it’s not 2012.\n\t\nWarren, who unseated Brown two years ago, is set to go after her old nemesis this weekend, when she will campaign for Senator Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, who faces Brown on Nov. 4.\n“Never in a bazillion years did it cross my mind that Scott Brown would pack up and move to his vacation house in New Hampshire to run against our friend Jeanne,” Warren wrote in an e-mail to her and Shaheen’s supporters, referring to Brown moving his primary residence from Wrentham to Rye, N.H., late last year.But, Warren wrote, that’s what happened, the race is neck-and-neck, and that’s “why I’m going to New Hampshire next weekend to join Jeanne Shaheen, to make sure our neighbors know as much about Scott Brown’s record as the voters of Massachusetts did when they decided to turn him out.”Warren is scheduled to campaign with Shaheen on Saturday, according to a Shaheen aide. While the Massachusetts senator has  for Shaheen, this will be the first time she is campaigning for her Democratic colleague in New Hampshire.In the e-mail, Warren also reprised familiar attacks against Brown on issues from the economy to education.A Brown spokeswoman, Elizabeth Guyton, said in a statement it doesn’t matter who Shaheen brings into New Hampshire to boost her campaign as “she can’t escape the fact that for six years she has brought the failed policies of President Obama to the Granite State by voting with him 99 percent of the time.”\n\nAn outside group backed by left-leaning military veterans plans to launch a $600,000 advertising campaign on behalf of Democratic congressional candidate Seth Moulton in his race against Republican Richard Tisei.The , scheduled to begin airing Tuesday, shows side-by-side images of Moulton and Tisei, praising Moulton’s military service and seeking to paint Tisei as “a career politician” in thrall to his party’s conservative wing.A female narrator praises Moulton, who is shown smiling, as “a courageous veteran” and “inspiring leader,” while Tisei is quoted as calling the Tea Party a “godsend” and depicted next to Sarah Palin, former Alaska governor.VoteVets is a nonprofit advocacy group that says it has aired more than $15 million in TV and radio ads in 30 states.The group previously backed Moulton during the primary, when he beat incumbent US Representative John F. Tierney, with an ad that hit the airwaves in mid-August.A Marine veteran of four tours of Iraq, Moulton last week  medal for valor and the Navy and Marine Corps Commendation medal for valor — a rare instance of a politician intentionally underplaying military honors.After national Democrats last week announced plans to pare back TV advertising in the race, saying they were confident in Moulton’s chances, Tisei waved off an expected influx of outside spending.“I think you’re going to see all kinds of groups come in and out,” he said, adding, “We have our plan that we’re executing.”\n\n\n\nWorking to strengthen their support in communities of color, Martha Coakley and Charlie Baker met separately Monday with the Black Ministerial Alliance of Greater Boston.After the closed-door meetings at Twelfth Baptist Church in Roxbury, Coakley — who was joined by Governor Deval Patrick — said she had spoken with the group about a range of issues, from boosting educational opportunities to a program aimed at helping boys and young men of color get ahead.Baker, who has held a number of campaign events in communities of color that traditionally vote Democratic, said he spoke about his “,” which includes an emphasis on expanding educational and economic opportunity and public safety in cities around the state.Evan Falchuk, one of three independent candidates for governor, also met with the Black Ministerial Alliance.The group, which is not expected to offer an endorsement in the gubernatorial race, describes itself as “an alliance of over 80 faith-based and community-based organizations with a 40+ year history of serving the Black community in Boston.”\n\n\n\nDemocratic gubernatorial nominee Martha Coakley and a super PAC supporting her Republican rival both released new television ads set to begin airing Tuesday.In her spot, Coakley frames herself as a fighter for everyday people and describes opponent Charlie Baker as a typical Republican. The pro-Baker political action committee’s ad defends him from attacks and lauds him as bipartisan.“Charlie Baker is offering the typical Republican plan,” Coakley narrates in her spot, “tax cuts for corporations, not much for the rest of us.”In the ad, paid for by the Massachusetts Democratic State Committee, she says she has a different view.She wants an economy where everyone “gets a fair shot,” and mentions early childhood education, equal pay for women, and earned sick time.Jim Conroy, Baker’s campaign manager, panned the spot, saying it distracts voters “from the fact that Charlie Baker supports paid sick leave, and supports equal pay.”In the  from the pro-Baker super PAC — Commonwealth Future Independent Expenditure Political Action Committee — a female narrator pushes back on attacks against Baker that  from a pro-Coakley PAC.“Why are special interests trying to fool you about Charlie Baker?” she asks. “Because he’s independent and will put partisanship aside.”The narrator goes to say that Baker is “strongly pro-choice,” “fully supports the ban on assault weapons,” and is “the independent governor we need.”\n\n
ANDOVER — Lorna Simpson’s work tends to have a disconcerting directness. Her photographs, texts, videos, constructions, and serigraphs present themselves straightforwardly. Neither concealment nor obscurity is in her artistic nature. Elusiveness is. That variety of media is one factor in making her hard to pin down. Another is how often Simpson predicates her work on dualities: image/text, darkness/light, fact/fiction, past/present, male/female, still/moving, self/other, detachment/indignation, black/not black (a splendid rejoinder to white/not white, that duality imposed on America from the moment Columbus first realized the New World was inhabited). Directness/elusiveness is itself a duality, of course. The point of hiding in plain sight is that nothing appears hidden.\n\t\nA retrospective covering three decades of Simpson’s work takes up the second floor of the Addison Gallery of American Art. It runs through Jan. 4, as do the other exhibitions currently there: “Dwight Tryon and American Tonalism” and “Exterior Spaces, Interior Places.”What could be more direct than “Waterbearer” (1986)? In the photograph, an African-American woman wearing a white garment stands pouring out the contents of two vessels. The accompanying text reads, “She saw him disappear by the river, they asked her to tell what happened, only to discount her memory.” More directness: The text is all caps, in a sans-serif font. Yet what exactly is going on? The woman stands with her back to the camera. “Photographing from the back,” Simpson has said, “was a way to get viewers’",

Pistorius was then led away, stopping briefly to grip the hands of his uncle and other family members as he headed to prison.Prosecutors said they are considering whether to appeal the sentence, since Pistorius, 27, could serve less than a year in jail for killing his 29-year-old girlfriend. They have 14 days to apply for permission to appeal.Nathi Mncube, the prosecution spokesman, said his office was disappointed in the culpable homicide conviction and had not yet decided whether to appeal. \n‘‘We are satisfied with the fact that he will be serving some time in prison,’’ Mncube said.Masipa had a wide range of options available to her because South Africa does not have a minimum sentence for culpable homicide, which is comparable to manslaughter. Pistorius, a once-inspiring athlete known as the Blade Runner because he competed on carbon-fiber blades, was the first amputee to run at the Olympics, in 2012. He had faced up to 15 years in jail. He also could have received a completely suspended sentence or house arrest.The sentence raised questions about whether Pistorius, a multiple Paralympic champion, would ever return to the career that made him famous. The International Paralympic Committee said he would not be eligible to run during his five-year sentence, ruling him out of the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Paralympics.
State Police say that they found a stash of heroin worth hundreds of thousands of dollars in a car that was stopped for traffic violations in Sturbridge.David Morales, 35, of Salem was stopped after troopers observed him making an unsafe lane change around 1 p.m. Monday on Interstate 84, State Police said in a posting on their blog. \n\t\nTroopers also noticed the windows of his 2007 Nissan Altima were tinted beyond the legal limit. Troopers searched Morales’s car, finding about four kilograms of a substance believed to be heroin. The heroin was worth about $400,000 wholesale, State Police said. Morales was arrested on charges that included trafficking heroin. He is being held on $100,000 bail, pending arraignment in Dudley District Court. 
Officials at the Franklin Park Zoo are hoping to change the public’s image of the spotted hyena by bringing two of the animals, which are aggressive predators in their home habitat, to Boston.Thika, age 15, and Kai, age 5, made their public debut last week after being moved from Lincoln Park Zoo in Chicago, said John Linehan, Zoo New England chief executive officer.\n\t\nThis is the first time the zoo has exhibited this particular species, which is native to sub-Saharan Africa, Linehan said. “We wanted to get the hyenas because pop culture often makes them look like villains, but they really are fascinating animals,” Linehan said. “We want to be able to address those misconceptions and convey the incredible biodiversity of the planet.” Linehan said the hyenas can be seen in the exhibit that was previously occupied by the lone  African painted dog, which was relocated to the Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden last summer. However, he said, since hyenas are “far more powerful” than the dogs, the zoo had to “beef up” the security of the exhibit. Spotted hyenas are known for the distinctive vocalizations they use for communication, such as cackles, howls, yells, and other sounds that are inaudible to humans, according to a statement by the zoo. “The public has been fascinated by them,” Linehan said. “People have just been staying there and watching them for a really long time.” 
Democrat Martha Coakley and Republican Charlie Baker, in their first one-on-one televised debate, on Tuesday night revealed glimpses of their personalities and threw occasional jabs as they attacked one another’s records and plans for the future.With less than two weeks until Election Day, and polls indicating a dead heat, both Coakley and Baker were tightly controlled and at times tense as they worked to avoid major gaffes or viral video moments that could suddenly upend the race.\n\t\nBut they still clashed over the most charged issues in the contest, including allegations that Coakley had ignored dire warnings about the problems in the state’s child protection system and that Baker was involved in a pay-to-play scandal.Over the hour-long debate, Coakley repeatedly challenged Baker on his record at Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, attacking him for increasing his salary and raising premiums while striking a deal that ultimately sent some jobs overseas. Baker appeared to talk at greater length and in deeper detail, while she struck back with some shorter, sharper retorts.Baker took swipes at Coakley, as well, but seemed more determined to protect his warmer image and appeal to undecided and urban voters he will need to win in an overwhelmingly Demcractic state. He spoke less of spreadsheets and corporate experience and more about his urban agenda. At one point, he pledged that if he could use the governor’s bully pulpit to tackle one issue, it would be to find more nighttime activities for urban youth.During another exchange, he recalled his experience riding along with a police officer on a Friday night in Dorchester. He recounted seeing families barbecuing and cheerleaders at a football game, and said the officer, “Sergeant Johnson,” recognized many of the faces at the field. “We’ve got to embed ourselves – as human beings – in these communities so people understand not only do we care about them, but we get where they’re coming from,” said Baker, who lives in Swampscott.Coakley responded briskly, dismissing Baker’s experience as a brief foray into a minority community.“Well, in fairness, I’ve done that for about 18 years as an assistant district attorney and a district attorney,” she said. “So I’m glad you got the ride along, Charlie.”Baker’s desire to cultivate a softer image – a contrast with the hard-edged tone he presented in his 2010 campaign for governor – was evident throughout the night. When he was asked what the biggest misconception about him is, he said he chafed at the image painted by Democrats that he cares more about numbers than people.“For me, it’s always been about people and it bothers me that a guy who is pretty facile with math, which does matter when you’re talking about a $38 billion budget, is somehow considered to be somebody who doesn’t care about people,” he said.But Coakley did not concede that point, hammering the argument that he privatized mental health services and cut jobs when he was in state government in the 1990s and then increased his salary while outsourcing jobs at Harvard Pilgrim.“I wouldn’t make those choices, Charlie,” she said, adding, “We can debate about whether you’re a good guy or not – I don’t dispute that. It’s about the values that drive your choices.”The debate, sponsored by the Boston Globe and WGBH, featured the candidates seated closely at a table, answering questions from moderators Jim Braude and Margery Eagan who sat across from them. Globe reporters also provided videotaped questions. Without the three independent candidates - Evan Falchuk, Scott Lively, and Jeff McCormick – the two leading contenders spent more time parsing and defending their records than in the previous, five-person debates. The pair has one final televised debate left before the Nov. 4 election.As he has in past debates, Baker sharply criticized Coakley for defending the state from a lawsuit filed by a children’s advocacy group that has accused the Department of Children and Families of failing to properly care for foster children. He said her decision “not to fix it but to fight it” showed “a lack of judgment.”Coakley responded by pointing out that the case was dismissed by a judge, and said she was right to push back against “outside lawyers suing us with a one-size-fits-all solution.”The problems at DCF surfaced again when the candidates watched clips of attack ads being run on their behalf by Super PACs, including one ad that harshly criticizes Coakley for fighting the lawsuit. Coakley called the ad “heinous” and said it essentially argues that “I sat by while children we killed.”“That’s outrageous,” she said.But Baker said that while he disagreed with the tone of the ad, the questions it raised about her fight against the lawsuit were legitimate. And he expressed indignation that Coakley would criticize him for the ad when he said the first attack ad aired by a super PAC ad in the race went after him.“She doesn’t have any credibility on this issue, in my opinion,” he said.Coakley sought to put Baker on the defensive over allegations that he was involved in a play-to-play scheme involving a donation he made while working for a Cambridge-based venture capital firm. Baker donated $10,000 to the New Jersey state Republican Party in 2011. Democrats have tried to tie that to a $15 million investment the New Jersey pension fund then made with Baker’s firm, General Catalyst.Baker said he had commissioned an outside legal review that showed he did nothing wrong. But Coakley said the issue was by no means settled. “He’s under investigation now for a pay-to-play scheme,” she said. “Those facts at least on their face indicate at least from my point of view a reason to investigate.”In a rare moment of pique, Baker shot back that Coakley is the one with tarnished record involving campaign cash, alluding to a controversy last spring when Coakley settled allegations that she used her federal US Senate funds for state political activities. “Can I just point out there’s only one person at this table who has paid a campaign violation fine, and that’s the attorney general,” he said. \n
\n, two candidates, two moderators asking policy questions — Tuesday’s debate was the kind of wonkathon where Republican Charlie Baker generally excels. But beneath the dutiful discussion of issues, a psychodrama brewed: Democrat Martha Coakley needed to reassure voters confounded by her 2010 Senate loss and her bizarrely contentless primary campaign this year. Baker, blessed and cursed with an image as an alpha technocrat, needed to present himself in a more genial way. Sadly for him, Coakley handled her task better than Baker did his.Baker didn’t mention welfare, a staple of his TV ads. He stressed the similarities between his stance and Coakley’s on expanding pre-K. But flashes of testiness kept showing through: Favoritism for political insiders is “what drives people crazy,” Baker said. “It makes me nuts,” he said, to run into people harmed by federal inaction on immigration. The perception that he cares more about numbers than people is the “single biggest thing that drives me up the wall.” \n\t\nMessage: I care already!Meanwhile, Coakley seems to be finishing strong. Until recently, her campaign strategy made her appear defensive. Wary of jeopardizing her front-runner status, Coakley coasted to her party’s nomination with gauzy appeals to key Democratic constituencies and vague promises to “look at” this or that. For the general election, another train wreck seemed possible. “Martha Chokeley,” a  called her.On Tuesday, though, the few laugh lines belonged to her.  “Just don’t call me ‘sweetheart,’ ” Coakley said, after Baker called her “Margery” instead of “Martha.” “I’m glad you got the ride-along, Charlie,” she said, deflating his story about visiting a Pop Warner game in Dorchester with a Boston cop. Baker’s still figuring out how to challenge Coakley — just as she’s finding her way into a more comfortable groove. 
\n in Keene, N.H., provoked two equally incredulous reactions. First: Seriously — riots at a pumpkin festival? Second: Seriously — tear gas at a riot at a pumpkin festival? The college-age rioters may have truly believed they were just fighting for their right to party, and the police who responded may have honestly believed that Keene was on the brink of civil insurrection, but both badly need a reality check. The melee started on Saturday afternoon, during the middle of the city’s annual Pumpkin Festival, when a party at a house near the Keene State College campus spun out of control. Outmatched officers struggled to contain the disruption as it spilled onto nearby streets. Showing little respect for  or a community event meant to honor it, the rioters smashed windows, slashed tires, and overturned Dumpsters. Many of the rioters reportedly came from other schools; the next day, as Keene State became the object of national mockery,  from the college volunteered to clean up the mess.\n\t\nPrimary responsibility lies with the instigators, and Keene State College has . With plenty of video of the events, that probably won’t prove especially difficult. Reflecting the gravity of the situation, on Monday afternoon the governor of New Hampshire called for any other educational institutions whose students participated to hold them accountable as well. The best punishment would probably be to merely publish their names, ensuring that rioters will spend the next few years trying to explain any pumpkin-related indiscretions to future employers.  Still, rowdy students, sometimes displaying less than stellar judgement, are a stubborn fact of life on college campuses, and overreacting has its own dangers. The University of Massachusetts Amherst has faced a similar situation centered around the annual Blarney Blowout, which  this year. A  by former Boston police commissioner Edward F. Davis called for the police . “The donning of riot helmets and the use of chemical munitions had the effect of creating confusion and perpetuating the unruly behavior of the crowd,” the report found.Indeed, in the Keene case, the mere presence of advanced weaponry only seemed to aggravate the situation. “Bring out the BearCat,” the students reportedly chanted, referring to an armored vehicle owned by the Keene police. The Davis report on the Amherst disturbances should provide some guidance for Keene and other college towns, too. It turns out that over-armed police forces aren’t just a problem for those protesting police brutality against African-Americans in Missouri. Whether it’s at a demonstration in Ferguson or a Pumpkin Festival gone awry in Keene, police shouldn’t respond to civil unrest with weaponry out of a war zone. \n
The leaves are turning. Scott Brown is driving his pickup truck. And Elizabeth Warren is on the attack against him.But it’s not 2012.\n\t\nWarren, who unseated Brown two years ago, is set to go after her old nemesis this weekend, when she will campaign for Senator Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, who faces Brown on Nov. 4.\n“Never in a bazillion years did it cross my mind that Scott Brown would pack up and move to his vacation house in New Hampshire to run against our friend Jeanne,” Warren wrote in an e-mail to her and Shaheen’s supporters, referring to Brown moving his primary residence from Wrentham to Rye, N.H., late last year.But, Warren wrote, that’s what happened, the race is neck-and-neck, and that’s “why I’m going to New Hampshire next weekend to join Jeanne Shaheen, to make sure our neighbors know as much about Scott Brown’s record as the voters of Massachusetts did when they decided to turn him out.”Warren is scheduled to campaign with Shaheen on Saturday, according to a Shaheen aide. While the Massachusetts senator has  for Shaheen, this will be the first time she is campaigning for her Democratic colleague in New Hampshire.In the e-mail, Warren also reprised familiar attacks against Brown on issues from the economy to education.A Brown spokeswoman, Elizabeth Guyton, said in a statement it doesn’t matter who Shaheen brings into New Hampshire to boost her campaign as “she can’t escape the fact that for six years she has brought the failed policies of President Obama to the Granite State by voting with him 99 percent of the time.”\n\nAn outside group backed by left-leaning military veterans plans to launch a $600,000 advertising campaign on behalf of Democratic congressional candidate Seth Moulton in his race against Republican Richard Tisei.The , scheduled to begin airing Tuesday, shows side-by-side images of Moulton and Tisei, praising Moulton’s military service and seeking to paint Tisei as “a career politician” in thrall to his party’s conservative wing.A female narrator praises Moulton, who is shown smiling, as “a courageous veteran” and “inspiring leader,” while Tisei is quoted as calling the Tea Party a “godsend” and depicted next to Sarah Palin, former Alaska governor.VoteVets is a nonprofit advocacy group that says it has aired more than $15 million in TV and radio ads in 30 states.The group previously backed Moulton during the primary, when he beat incumbent US Representative John F. Tierney, with an ad that hit the airwaves in mid-August.A Marine veteran of four tours of Iraq, Moulton last week  medal for valor and the Navy and Marine Corps Commendation medal for valor — a rare instance of a politician intentionally underplaying military honors.After national Democrats last week announced plans to pare back TV advertising in the race, saying they were confident in Moulton’s chances, Tisei waved off an expected influx of outside spending.“I think you’re going to see all kinds of groups come in and out,” he said, adding, “We have our plan that we’re executing.”\n\n\n\nWorking to strengthen their support in communities of color, Martha Coakley and Charlie Baker met separately Monday with the Black Ministerial Alliance of Greater Boston.After the closed-door meetings at Twelfth Baptist Church in Roxbury, Coakley — who was joined by Governor Deval Patrick — said she had spoken with the group about a range of issues, from boosting educational opportunities to a program aimed at helping boys and young men of color get ahead.Baker, who has held a number of campaign events in communities of color that traditionally vote Democratic, said he spoke about his “,” which includes an emphasis on expanding educational and economic opportunity and public safety in cities around the state.Evan Falchuk, one of three independent candidates for governor, also met with the Black Ministerial Alliance.The group, which is not expected to offer an endorsement in the gubernatorial race, describes itself as “an alliance of over 80 faith-based and community-based organizations with a 40+ year history of serving the Black community in Boston.”\n\n\n\nDemocratic gubernatorial nominee Martha Coakley and a super PAC supporting her Republican rival both released new television ads set to begin airing Tuesday.In her spot, Coakley frames herself as a fighter for everyday people and describes opponent Charlie Baker as a typical Republican. The pro-Baker political action committee’s ad defends him from attacks and lauds him as bipartisan.“Charlie Baker is offering the typical Republican plan,” Coakley narrates in her spot, “tax cuts for corporations, not much for the rest of us.”In the ad, paid for by the Massachusetts Democratic State Committee, she says she has a different view.She wants an economy where everyone “gets a fair shot,” and mentions early childhood education, equal pay for women, and earned sick time.Jim Conroy, Baker’s campaign manager, panned the spot, saying it distracts voters “from the fact that Charlie Baker supports paid sick leave, and supports equal pay.”In the  from the pro-Baker super PAC — Commonwealth Future Independent Expenditure Political Action Committee — a female narrator pushes back on attacks against Baker that  from a pro-Coakley PAC.“Why are special interests trying to fool you about Charlie Baker?” she asks. “Because he’s independent and will put partisanship aside.”The narrator goes to say that Baker is “strongly pro-choice,” “fully supports the ban on assault weapons,” and is “the independent governor we need.”\n\n
Democrat Martha Coakley and Republican Charlie Baker, in their first one-on-one televised debate, on Tuesday night sought to be the most compassionate candidate in the governor’s race, but also attacked each other’s records and plans for the future.With less than two weeks until Election Day and polls indicating a dead heat, both Coakley and Baker were tightly controlled and at times tense as they worked to avoid major gaffes or viral video moments that could suddenly upend the race.\n\t\nBut they still clashed over the most charged issues in the contest, including allegations that Coakley had ignored dire warnings about the problems in the state’s child protection system and that Baker was involved in a pay-to-play scandal.Over the hour-long debate, Coakley repeatedly challenged Baker on his record at Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, faulting him for increasing his salary and raising premiums while striking a deal that ultimately sent some jobs overseas. Baker appeared to talk at greater length and in deeper detail, while Coakley struck back with some shorter, sharper retorts.Baker took swipes at Coakley, as well, but seemed more determined to protect his warmer image and appeal to undecided and urban voters he will need to win in an overwhelmingly Democratic state.He spoke less of spreadsheets and corporate experience and more about his urban agenda. At one point, he pledged that if he could use the governor’s bully pulpit to tackle one issue, it would be to find more nighttime activities for urban youth.During another exchange, he recalled his experience riding along with a police officer on a Friday night in Dorchester. He recounted seeing families barbecuing and cheerleaders at a football game, and said the officer, “Sergeant Johnson,” recognized many of the faces at the field.“We’ve got to embed ourselves — as human beings — in these communities, so people understand not only do we care about them, but we get where they’re coming from,” said Baker, who lives in Swampscott.Coakley responded pointedly, dismissing Baker’s experience as a brief foray into a minority community.“Well, in fairness, I’ve done that for about 18 years as an assistant district attorney and a district attorney,” she said. “So I’m glad you got the ride along, Charlie.”Baker’s desire to cultivate a softer image — a contrast with the hard-edged tone he presented in his 2010 campaign for governor — was evident throughout the night. When he was asked what the biggest misconception about him is, he said he chafed at the image painted by Democrats that he cares more about numbers than people.“For me, it’s always been about people, and it bothers me that a guy who is pretty facile with math, which does matter when you’re talking about a $38 billion budget, is somehow considered to be somebody who doesn’t care about people,” he said.But Coakley did not concede that point, hammering the argument that he privatized mental health services and cut jobs when he was in state government in the 1990s and then increased his salary while outsourcing jobs at Harvard Pilgrim.“I wouldn’t make those choices, Charlie,” she said, adding, “We can debate about whether you’re a good guy or not; I don’t dispute that. It’s about the values that drive your choices.”The debate, sponsored by the Boston Globe and WGBH, featured the candidates seated closely at a table, answering questions from moderators Jim Braude and Margery Eagan, who sat across from them. Globe reporters also provided videotaped questions.Without the three independent candidates — Evan Falchuk, Scott Lively, and Jeff McCormick — the two leading contenders spent more time parsing and defending their records than in the previous, five-person debates. The election is Nov. 4.As he has in past debates, Baker sharply criticized Coakley for defending the state from a lawsuit filed by a children’s advocacy group that has accused the Department of Children and Families of failing to properly care for foster children. He said her decision “not to fix it but to fight it” showed “a lack of judgment.”Coakley responded by pointing out that the case was dismissed by a judge and said she was right to push back against “outside lawyers suing us with a one-size-fits-all solution.”The problems at DCF surfaced again when the candidates watched clips of attack ads being run on their behalf by super PACs, including one ad that harshly criticizes Coakley for fighting the lawsuit.

She was a devoted mother and aspiring lawyer who worked full time while taking online law school classes. She spent her free time doting on her daughter, and loved ones said she never missed her family’s big Sunday dinners. And her life ended violently Saturday morning in an attack loved ones say started as an argument over a cigarette. Maria Sanchez, 26, was stabbed to death during a fight at a party at 4:45 a.m. Saturday in the area of 188 Washington St. in Dorchester, her family said Wednesday. Boston police have not yet identified Sanchez. Her family confirmed her identity.\n\t\n“She was the key to this family,” said her uncle, David Sanchez, 38, who said his niece went by the nickname Ceci. “If she had, we all had. That was her motto: If one eats, we all eat.”Three other women were injured during the melee, according to Boston police. Sanchez’s aunt was also stabbed six times and remains in the hospital, according to her family.  A law enforcement official who spoke on condition of anonymity confirmed that the fight is believed to have broken out after someone lit a cigarette, which offended another person present. All involved in the fight were women, said the official. No arrests have yet been made, according to Boston police.“I just want justice to be served,” said Maria Sanchez’s cousin, Brandon Sanchez, 20, who said her death, over something as “irrelevant” as a cigarette, was needless. He and Maria Sanchez were more like brother and sister than cousins, he said, and she held the whole family together. “She always had her friends’ and family’s back,” said Brandon Sanchez, who is David Sanchez’s son. “She had a heart for people.”David Sanchez said his niece’s life revolved around her family. She worked so hard that she was often up until 2 or 3 a.m., but always found time to take her 8-year-old daughter, Danalys, to see a movie or get her nails painted.Maria Sanchez “was such a good, beautiful, strong individual, I just don’t understand how something like this could happen to a person like her,” said David Sanchez. “She wasn’t in the street. All she did was work, come home, take care of her daughter.”His niece was engaged, he said, and was planning her wedding. The Sanchez family is huge and loving, said David Sanchez, who said he has 18 brothers and sisters. Family members meet up in groups on Sundays for family meals, he said. He said he will always cherish the Sundays he got to spend with Maria just the two of them — they would shut off their phones and talk about life. They would try to watch movies, he said, but Maria could never sit still, so they always wound up having to rewind. “The movie would take four hours to finish,” he said, laughing.The last time he saw her, he said, he had gotten into a little trouble and was in a residential program. It was Thursday, less than two days before she would be stabbed to death. She brought him some cigarettes and some money, and made sure he didn’t need anything. “She was just letting me know that she was gonna be here for me,” Sanchez said. “She told me to take it easy. She gave me a hug and a kiss and told me she loved me.”The family has started a  to help pay for her funeral. As of Wednesday evening, it had raised just over $2,100. Maria Sanchez’s former boyfriend, Scott Liquori, 29, said she had inspired him to be a better person. The two were together on and off for about five years, he said, and stayed friends even after they broke up. “When I met her, I was just kind of in my own little world, doing my own little thing,” said Liquori. “She motivated me to get away from the negativity I was around  .\xa0.\xa0.  I would give my life right now to bring her back, in a heartbeat.” He said he grieves for her family and her fiance. Sanchez was a star, he said, who walked into a room and made it glow. Her daughter, Danalys, wanted to be just like her, he said. Now, said Sanchez’s uncle, her family is left to raise Danalys. They told the little girl that her mother was killed, said David Sanchez, but she is confused. “She’s taking it hard,” he said. “She’s really sad. She feels lonely.”Anyone who witnessed the fight on Saturday morning, said Boston Police spokesman Officer James Kenneally, should call 800-494-TIPS, or 617-343-4470. 
Charlie Baker had a great debate on Tuesday night.Martha Coakley did, too. Democrats should stop whining about 2010 and her supposed warmth deficit. She’s a much better candidate than she gets credit for.\n\t\nBut the Republican hopeful for governor, oft criticized for being a bloodless wonk, was winningly passionate and sincere. He was emotional when he spoke of meeting parents desperate for more charter schools. He seemed genuine, if clumsy, as he described touring a tough neighborhood with a police officer, who showed him cookouts and football where headlines find only mayhem. Rebutting the notion that he cares more about numbers than people, Baker was almost teary. “For me, it’s always been about people,” he said.More remarkable than his words is where Baker can often be found seeking out those people. The doors he knocked on to meet those desperate parents were in Dorchester, Mattapan, and Springfield. The neighborhood he toured with the officer was in Dorchester. Asked how he’d use his bully pulpit as governor, he said he’d push for more nighttime activities for urban youth.Baker has been all over urban, heavily minority, Democratic strongholds in this campaign, attempting to pick off voters, collecting endorsements from local bigs.In Boston, Robert Lewis Jr., who heads up baseball mentoring outfit The BASE, came out for Baker early and enthusiastically. For Lewis, it’s personal: Baker has supported his work for years. In return, Lewis has opened doors that would otherwise have been closed to the Republican. The Bay State Banner recently  of a fantastically awkward Baker attempting to get down with Lewis and others at an Urban League cookout. The guy can’t dance to save his life, but he gets serious points for trying.Baker has gotten nods from other black leaders, including voting activist Kevin Peterson, former state senator Bill Owens, and Larry Ellison, head of the Minority Law Enforcement Officers association. And he has made personal connections: “He got to know me and who I was,” , who came out from behind the counter at the Haley House Café to hug Baker when he visited in June.Baker desperately needs voters like Awan this year.  in Commonwealth Magazine, changing demographics mean Baker cannot win using the suburban strategy that sent his Republican predecessors to Beacon Hill: He must do better in urban centers. Courting those voters also sends a message to moderate Democrats: Baker may be a Republican, but he cares about everyone.According to MassINC polls, , with Baker significantly narrowing Coakley’s advantage in cities. He has done so despite some of his policies: Cities are packed with low-wage earners desperate for earned sick time, which Baker supports only conditionally. It’s also hard to square his  (virtually every measure he’s pushing is already in place) with his concern for communities of color: Welfare fraud is a dog-whistle issue that fires up angry white voters. And while his defense of Dorchester as an apple-pie community on Tuesday was laudable, his choice of words was less so: He spoke of the need to “embed ourselves .\xa0.\xa0. in these communities,” as if they were as foreign as Fallujah.So, plenty of urban voters still aren’t buying Baker, despite his genuine efforts. Coakley will still take Roxbury handily. In a couple of weeks, we’ll know if Baker has made enough headway on this turf to beat her statewide.But there are already winners here: Urban voters, taken for granted or written off in other elections, are now more powerful than ever.
\nofficials in New Haven, Conn. opened a public housing development in the most isolated location possible:  that handled the city’s garbage. The land jutted into the neighboring town of Hamden like mismatched puzzle piece, surrounded on three sides by modest homesteads along a quiet county road.The white storekeepers and clerks of Hamden protested, until the two municipalities struck a deal: a fence would separate the public housing tenants in New Haven from the homeowners of Hamden. \n\t\nThat fence has endured for more than half a century; longer than the DMZ separating North and South Korea. Longer than the barrier dividing Israelis and Palestinians. Longer than the Berlin Wall. Every wall has a story. The story of this one, and the battle to tear it down, shows how complicated race and class have become in America.At first, the fence was short enough to climb over. Most public housing tenants back then were white. Many were soldiers returning from the war. (Blacks, who mostly worked in munitions factories, made up about a third of the tenants.)But in 1957, a Hamden housewife on Thorpe Street refused to return a New Haven boy’s ball. He climbed over the fence and kicked her, according to, a doctoral candidate at Rutgers. Outraged, Hamden built the fence taller.In the 1960s, ambitious public housing tenants saved their money and left. Some bought houses just beyond the fence, in Hamden. By the 1980s, the development only housed people with nowhere else to go. Kids sold drugs and cut holes in the fence to steal cars from Hamden driveways.New Haven realized the folly of concentrating poverty at the bitter end of an unreliable bus line. The city got a federal grant to transform the development into a mixed-income community. But the plan called for removing the fence. Hamden refused. “We did cook outs and movie nights, hoping to get past this ‘us and them’ feeling,” recalled , executive director of New Haven’s housing authority.But Hamden residents didn’t come. Even Hamden’s mayor — a black man — could not change their minds. Theyat a town meeting in 2012. The dispute was only resolved after a land surveyor discovered that the fence stood on New Haven land. Earlier this year, Hamden residents watched bulldozers rip down a portion of the fence.But bitterness remains. Some call Hamden’s resistance racism. But Hamden is a mixed-race place. Some of the loudest defenders of the fence . Others call it classism. But many Hamden homes are blue collar bungalows, with Chevy pick up trucks rusting out front. Beyond race and class, the final barrier — culture? worldview? — looms. Only time will tell how surmountable it will be.Recently, I met , a former New Haven alderman who fought the fence. Goldson, who is black, used to visit his grandmother in the housing development as a child. He remembers how it irked her that Hamden people could walk to Walgreens in 20 minutes, while she had to take two buses and transfer in downtown to get to the same shopping mall.Goldson showed me his grandmother’s now-vacant building, which awaits reincarnation silently, but for the frenetic hymns of crickets. Then we drove the three-mile loop to the Hamden side. We gazed up at 16 feet of silver wire from the opposite angle. We eyed an abandoned-looking house on Thorpe street, its porch sagging into a frown.“The irony is that the new home ownership units in the housing development will be worth more someday than homes on the Hamden side,” said Goldson. But moments after making that prediction, he remarked on how strange it felt to stand in Hamden. “I never come here,” he said. “I’d better get going.”Across that old country road, a white woman paused her gardening long enough to chat. She’d lived there 30 years, but pointed out homes of folks who’d been there longer: Louie, on the corner. Mrs. Ruth, who’d recently died.“We just don’t want the neighborhood to change,” she said. “It’s the unknown. You don’t want to say that, but we fear elements from the projects.”Had she seen the attractive new town houses that have been built just beyond the fence and trees? She shook her head. “I’ve never been there,” she said. Her voice told me she’d never go.That’s the funny thing about walls: if they’ve been around long enough, they remain in our heads, even after we tear them down.  
MBTA Transit Police are investigating a rash of vandalism by a group of rowdy young people who have allegedly damaged lights at Shawmut Station and broken Orange and Red Line train windows, injuring one woman who was hit by the falling glass.“We take it very seriously,” said Lieutenant Detective Richard Sullivan. “We’re not going to tolerate it. We’ve identified those responsible.”\n\t\nCharges including malicious destruction of property over $250, a felony, are pending against the alleged perpetrators, who are juveniles, said Sullivan. Each train window costs about $425 to replace, he said. On Tuesday night, the group allegedly broke a Red Line train window at Savin Hill MBTA station. On Saturday night, the group allegedly broke two windows of an Orange Line train, one of which hit a woman as it fell. On Friday, said Sullivan, the group allegedly damaged lighting at Shawmut Station. Some of the alleged destruction was captured on surveillance video, he said.“There’s a large group of juveniles, and within that group, there’s a good handful that is being very disruptive and causing malicious damage for unknown motivations,” said Sullivan. Sullivan acknowledged that Transit Police had heard rumors that the damage was inspired by the movie “The Purge,” which is about a society where all crime is legal for one night every year, but that officials have not determined whether there is a link. “It’s too early for us to say whether these kids are acting out based on a movie, whether it’s connected or not,” he said. “This investigation is still ongoing.”
An estimated 36,000 Americans are expected to die of the flu this year, but, if history is any indication, the majority of us will skip the recommended yearly vaccine. We’d likely, however, be lining up around the block to get an Ebola immunization if one was available — even though only one person has died of the infection in this country so far. Irrational fears about Ebola have become more contagious than the virus itself. About half of American adults are concerned that there will be a large outbreak of Ebola inside the United States within the next year, according to a  conducted earlier this month. More than a third are concerned that they or someone in their immediate family may get sick with Ebola. \n\t\nTwitter hastags like #EbolaFear and #EbolaCrazy this week documented the ridiculous lengths some people have gone to in an effort to avoid infection like the tweeted photo of an airline passenger who wore a  to Dulles airport in Virginia. Tweeted links to news stories told of a  placed on a 21-day leave demanded by parents because she recently attended a conference in Dallas — the same city where the Ebola patient Thomas Eric Duncan died on Oct. 8 — and a Mississippi principal who was banned from his school for attending his brother’s funeral in an African country, 3,000 miles away from the nearest Ebola case.Researchers who study risk perception say they’re not surprised by the epidemic of irrational  that has swept our nation. “This is a disease of mysterious origin with a really high death rate and scary symptoms,” like explosive diarrhea and bleeding from the eyes and mouth, said Arthur Caplan, head of the division of bioethics at New York University Langone Medical Center in New York City. “Even the name of the virus sounds like it comes right out of a Stephen King Novel.” A few missteps by federal and local health officials have stoked our insecurities. After Duncan was admitted to Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas, officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention initially reassured the public that the hospital staff had been fully trained in Ebola infection control skills — until, that is, two nurses got infected. While the CDC now treats Ebola patients at better equipped facilities and issued  this week for donning and removing personal protective equipment, those early flubs can’t be erased from the public’s mind.“There’s an appearance of incompetence,” Caplan said, “and just one or two mistakes creates a fear that authorities can’t do what they say they can.” Once the anxiety begins, it spreads. “We’re wired to transmit fear to each other, and from an evolutionary standpoint, you can see how it would be beneficial to scare us into avoiding those with contagious illnesses,” said Joshua Epstein, an emergency medicine professor and director of the Center for Advanced Modeling at Johns Hopkins University.In the age of social media, fear can spread much faster than the actual disease, he added, without any contact with infected people, triggering panicked over-reactions.While Epstein believes public health officials act in good faith when they reassure us that they can contain any future Ebola cases in the US, he said they should take all precautions to make sure we’re not shocked if, say, a traveler infected with Ebola slips through an airport screening. “Don’t give people the idea that rigorous screening will catch everyone,” he said, “because surprise sets people up for over-reactions.” Fear tends to be generated more by magnitude — whether an event is salient or arresting —  than by the likelihood or probability of the event actually happening to a single individual. Rapid associations we make when a surprising, horrific act occurs can trigger collective panic, said Epstein who creates research models to explain how individual events trigger mob violence, manias, and other over-reactions.We’re more afraid of Ebola than seasonal flu for this reason. The flu is familiar, and most of us recover from it, whereas Ebola, rare as it is, has a horrifyingly high death rate.Still, I’m wondering, why all this panic over three cases?Once we had a single case of Ebola in our country, the disease went from the impossible to the possible in people’s minds, said Valerie Reyna, a professor of psychology and director of the Human Neuroscience Institute at Cornell University. “People understand that it’s a small number of cases, but another part of their mind encodes impossibility and possibility,” she said. Once a terrifying prospect is now possible, we naturally become more fearful. We’re also attuned to sudden change and when Ebola cases ballooned in Sierra Leone and Liberia at a non-linear rapid rate, we felt a lack of control over a dangerous situation. The ballooning of news coverage added to our fears since research suggests the amount of news coverage correlates with public concern.“We want the spigot back in the off position,” Reyna said, “which is why people argue for closing our borders.” Ethical or not, that tactic won’t work to end the Ebola epidemic, she added, and could likely cause more cases by delaying treatment to countries devastated by the outbreak. What’s needed most, she added, is transparent risk communication where Americans are kept informed on why and how Ebola transmissions occur. “People need to understand why their government is taking certain actions and that there’s some level of uncertainty as to how well these actions will work,” Reyna said. “That’s a tremendous challenge, to provide meaningful information that eases fears.”\n
Governor Deval Patrick on Thursday highlighted the state’s progress in narrowing the achievement gap among schoolchildren from different ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds.In a speech at Bunker Hill Community College, Patrick cited recent MCAS results showing gains by African-American and Hispanic students in mathematics and English-language arts.\n\t\n  African-American students in the 10th grade have improved their scores on the English portion of the test by 24 points since 2007. Hispanic students saw a 26-point increase over the same period of time, he said.In mathematics, African-American students in the 10th grade have improved their MCAS scores by 28 points since 2007, Patrick said. Meanwhile, Hispanic students posted a 24-point increase in math.      “Mind you, this is all while standards were being raised across the board for all students,” Patrick said.Christopher Martes, head of the Boston education advocacy group Strategies for Children, said Patrick has been a “great supporter” of efforts to bolster school performance statewide.To make greater strides, Martes said, the state should invest more money in high-quality early education, especially in mid-sized urban centers where the achievement gap persists.He said those years are critical and cited research showing that children who cannot read proficiently by the end of third grade struggle in school. Reading scores among third-grade students have been flat for the last decade, Martes said.“If the state invested more .\xa0.\xa0. that investment would really pay off,” Martes said.Before the latest recession, the state invested about $200 million in early education, but since then funding has dropped to about $100 million, Martes said. He said the state needs to get back to that funding level to start making progress.“We think it’s a good start, but it cannot be ever framed as the solution,” he said.Patrick administration officials said the state budget for this year and fiscal 2014 included new money to pay for early childhood programs for poor children.That money resulted in more than 3,000 children being taken off a wait list last year and placed in subsidized child care programs, Patrick said. This year, an additional 2,500 children were placed, he said.   
PROVIDENCE — Buddy Cianci’s likeness stares down from the campaign sign on the roof of Chuck’s Barber Shop on Chalkstone Avenue, just as the former mayor once loomed large over this Irish and Italian neighborhood that was home to city workers who owed him their jobs.Inside, 81-year-old Chuck Perrotti swivels in his barber chair on a slow rainy afternoon and explains why Providence voters, twice burned, should give Cianci a third chance as mayor after two corruption-stained tours of City Hall.\n\t\nSure, Cianci crossed the line in his 21 years as mayor, the barber concedes. He was “too dictatorial,” and could be “an egotistical S.O.B.” But now, at the age of 73, Perrotti says, “Buddy wants to leave a legacy as a great leader, so anything that gets done will be from the heart.”While Perrotti’s sentiments offer Cianci encouragement, the barber moved to the suburbs years ago, and can’t vote. Two doors down, sharing the building that Cianci supporter and ex-legislator Joanne Giannini owns with her husband, the Nueva San Salvador Bakery displays a more discreet sign for Cianci’s rival, Democrat Jorge Elorza, a law professor, former housing court judge, and son of Guatemalan immigrants who went from Head Start to Harvard Law School.Providence has changed dramatically since Cianci last ran for mayor in 1998 and left City Hall for prison in 2002. Latinos make up the city’s largest ethnic group, climbing from 30 percent to nearly 40 percent of Providence’s 177,000 residents, according to the census.A diverse Latino population has also spread throughout the city from its traditional South Side base: Dominicans, Puerto Ricans, Mexicans, Guatemalans, Peruvians.That’s why Perrotti’s old Mount Pleasant neighborhood and Providence’s other once solidly Italian enclaves are no longer Buddy bedrocks. In 1979, a brash young Cianci told the visiting mayor of San Francisco that Machiavelli would fit right in as a North End pol. But Machiavelli doesn’t live there any more. Latinos and young middle-class families new to Providence have moved in.\n“Mount Pleasant is up for grabs,” says City Council President Michael Solomon, who lost to Elorza in the Democratic primary but now supports him. “We’re now a minority-majority city.”Even Federal Hill, Rhode Island’s Little Italy where corrupt Cianci lieutenants Buckles Melise and Blackjack DelSanto once counted votes and campaign contributions, will go to Elorza, local state Representative John Lombardi predicts. The Hill, he said, now looks like the affluent East Side near Brown University:“hipsters, gays, artists, students.”\nTrailing in September, Elorza has surged ahead, 48 percentage points to 38 points, in a new Brown University poll released Thursday, with 10 percent undecided. Elorza had 73 percent of the vote on the East Side, where he needs a large cushion to offset Cianci elsewhere. Elorza also led narrowly around Mount Pleasant and had a 15-point lead among likely Latino voters. Cianci led on the South Side and West End and among African-Americans. A previous poll had shown many undecideds concerned about Cianci’s criminal past. “I don’t see how he alleviates that,” says another Rhode Island pollster, Joe Fleming. “But never, ever count out Buddy Cianci.”Cianci remains formidable because of his charisma, savvy, and ability to forge winning coalitions in six previous City Hall campaigns. He was first elected in 1974 as a Republican by 709 votes, dominating the vote-rich East Side. When political infighting, corruption, and Providence’s near bankruptcy threatened his reelection in 1982, he ran as an independent and squeaked by in a three-way race, with strong Jewish support. Forced from office in 1984 for felony assault, Cianci returned in 1990 to win another three-way race, by 317 votes.Can he do it again?“Looking around the city, it’s hard to identify where his votes will come from,” says Providence College political science professor Tony Affigne. “It’s possible that the changed demographics of the city will overwhelm his efforts.”Affigne points to the proliferation of Buddy signs on non-owner-occupied tenements and questions if the Cianci campaign is “blue smoke and mirrors . . . a campaign of perception” aided and abetted by the national media’s fascination with Cianci’s celebrity while romanticizing his criminal past.To blunt Elorza’s strength on the East Side, Cianci has courted African-American voters, a small but key demographic in a close race, and targeted mail ballots, particularly in the Latino and Cambodian communities. The city has certified more than 3,000 mail ballots. That’s more than in recent elections but not as many as in Buddy’s heyday, when mail ballots factored into narrow wins and a black South Side councilman, Lloyd Griffin, was nicknamed “Satchel” for dumping a carpetbag filled with hundreds of mail ballots on Cianci’s desk. South Side state Senator Juan Pichardo, who backs Elorza, says that many older Latinos have photos of Cianci in their homes. As cofounder of the city’s Dominican Festival, Pichardo recalls appealing to Cianci when the city canceled the festival because of a conflict with a mechanical dinosaur exhibit. Cianci called the parks director, and demanded: “Do dinosaurs vote? The Dominicans will have their festival because they vote — they matter.”Many of Buddy’s backers and campaign veterans may be dinosaurs — older, grayer, living outside Providence — but they’re experienced. On Nov. 4, Elorza’s enthusiastic grass-roots campaign will face off against Cianci to see who has the better ground game. After a disappointing Democratic primary turnout of 19 percent, suggesting that the pundits may be more excited about this race than voters are, the most successful ground game will help decide whether Buddy is a dinosaur, or if he still matters.
It’s been a while since a movie has been as happily overcrowded as “Dear White People” — as packed with characters, incidents, ideas, provocations, diatribes, and jokes, jokes, jokes, all detonating like incendiary party poppers. The ragged-but-right debut of writer-director Justin Simien, the film doesn’t announce a new filmmaker so much as welcome a fresh sensibility into the conversations our entertainments have about race in America. You have to see this movie, and talk about it, to believe it.Set at the fictional Winchester College — a TWI (Traditionally White Institution) — among a handful of students of varying colors, “Dear White People” doesn’t see the world in black and white or even shades of gray but as fractious, endless gradations of tan. If there’s a central character, it’s Sam White (Tessa Thompson) — her name is one of Simien’s few rookie missteps — who’s the queen of the Black Students Union and the host of a campus radio show where she shoots out devilish, on-point messages to the school’s majority population. These pop up in the background of the soundtrack like razor-sharp confetti: “Dear white people: The minimum requirement of black friends needed to not seem racist has just been raised to two. Sorry, but your weed man Tyrone does not count” or “Dear white people: Stop dancing.”\n\t\nSam’s film studies project — a whiteface silent called “Rebirth of a Nation” — doesn’t go over well, but her bigger shame is that she’s dating the class TA, a gentle, white, upperclassman named Gabe (Justin Dobies). (He knows her darkest secret, too: She’s a Taylor Swift fan.) Her run for the presidency of Armstrong-Parker House, Winchester’s lone African-American residence hall, pits her against Troy Fairbanks (Brandon P Bell), the handsome scion of the college’s token black dean (Dennis Haysbert, seething hilariously) and a troubled soul who sneaks off from his white girlfriend (Brittany Curran) to get high in the bathroom. Papa would not approve; neither would the more militant black students like Reggie (Marque Richardson), who accuse Troy of majoring in shucking and jiving.Simien’s larger point — and it’s absurdly overdue in our ongoing social argument — is that we’re desperate to label ourselves and each other; meanwhile, the great cosmic joke about people is that they’re always bigger than their labels. So Colandrea Connors (Teyonah Parris), an ambitious freshman from Chicago’s South Side, can change her name to Coco (“‘Colandrea’ doesn’t really pass the resume test”) and tack so constantly between her two personas that she nearly loses her way.Or a newcomer like the wannabe journalist Lionel Harris (Tyler James Williams) can have so many labels — he’s black, he’s gay, he’s a nerd, he’s a giant afro that all the white students just have to touch — that everyone else looks right through him. There’s a quietly funny-sad moment where Lionel looks out on the campus green, gazes at the cliques available to him, and closes his eyes in frustration. “Dear White People” says that to be black at a TWI — to be black in America — is to be neurotic by default. The college’s motto is “Nosce Te Ipsum” — Know Thyself — but how can you do that when everyone who looks at you sees something different?“Dear White People” is the work of a first-timer, no doubt. It’s overwritten, choppily edited, at times naively acted. The white characters are thinly drawn in comparison, not a terrible sin in a pop culture where the reverse is the norm. Yet it’s just about the smartest movie I’ve seen in months and Simien’s weaknesses — he wants to think about, and talk about, and laugh about, and cry about what he sees — turn out to be unexpected strengths. Comparisons to Spike Lee — specifically his 1988 “School Daze” — are inevitable, but while Simien lacks Lee’s prodigious skills as a filmmaker, he sees people more clearly and compassionately. Even Kurt (Kyle Gallner), the sneering head of the college humor magazine and the film’s most obvious villain, is smarter and more self-aware than the goon squad he oversees, if just as blinkered by privilege. Any movie that features a protest rally outside a theater showing a Tyler Perry movie is on to something. And whenever you’re in doubt, the dialogue comes to the rescue, warm and sharp and poking everyone in his or her blind spots. Sam is plagued by repeated nightmares of being on “The Cosby Show”: “My hair was so straight .\xa0.\xa0. the sweaters so big.\xa0.\xa0.” One of the Black Students Union members tries to welcome Lionel: “We’re not homophobes, us black folks. I’m listening to Frank Ocean right now.” Kurt on Sam: “It’s like Spike Lee and Oprah had some pissed-off baby.” Troy sighing to his white girlfriend: “Babe, please don’t say like that.” Everyone wants to be someone else, darker, lighter, realer. That, of course, is where things get dicey. “Dear White People” can’t be all fun and games, and it builds to a “Release Your Inner Negro” party thrown by the white kids at which various punches are thrown and various plot strands resolved. If you think that’s far-fetched, Simien intersperses the end credits with photos from similar events at actual colleges across the country, clueless white dudes and dudettes in blackface and nappy wigs, grinning for the cameras. There’s an anger to this film — there has to be — but it’s cool and contained and, above all, sure of itself. Simien doesn’t want to start a fight; he wants to end the fights. But he knows that will never happen until people see their prejudices — all of them — without fear. That’s a tall order, but it’s good to have an idealist in the house.\n\n\n\n• \n• \n\n\n• \n• \n• \n
Former long-time Boston mayor Thomas M. Menino said Thursday afternoon that he was suspending his cancer treatments.Menino said in a statement that he and his family Thursday, after talking with his medical team, had “decided to suspend my book tour as well as my cancer treatments. While I continue to fight this terrible disease, I feel it is time for me to spend more time with my family, grandkids, and friends.”\n\t\nThe 71-year-old Menino, who stepped down from office in January after 20 years, said his doctors at the Brigham and Women’s Hospital along with those at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute have been “amazing in their care and treatment of me and the many other patients and families that suffer from cancer.”“I am hopeful and optimistic that one day the talented researchers, doctors and medical professionals in this city will find a cure for this awful disease. Angela and I are grateful for the tremendous outpouring of support and kindness shown to our family and ask that everyone keep us in their thoughts and prayers,” the statement said.The statement offered no further details.The Globe  that Menino, the “urban mechanic” who loved both the city and his job, had been diagnosed with an advanced form of cancer that had spread to his liver and lymph nodes.The Globe  that Menino had been hospitalized for several days with dehydration that might be related to a new cancer treatment, according to his spokeswoman. Menino was admitted last Thursday.Menino had suffered a variety of health problems in the past few years. In late 2012, he fell ill on a vacation in Italy. He was diagnosed with a respiratory infection and a blood clot. While hospitalized, he suffered a compression fracture in a vertebra, and he was later diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes. It was eight weeks before he was released from the hospital.His doctors said those ailments were not related to his current cancer. They also said his current cancer, whose primary origin was unknown, was unrelated to two previous bouts with cancer.Menino broke ground as the city’s first Italian-American mayor and was known as a detail-oriented chief executive who pushed for improvements to the city’s neighborhoods. He never moved from his modest house in the city’s Hyde Park section. While he acknowledged he was not a “fancy talker,” he kept a firm hand on the city’s tiller — and kept on winning reelection.He had recently released “Mayor for a New America,” an autobiography written in collaboration with Jack Beatty.In March 2013, Menino announced he would not seek reelection to office.“I am here with the people I love, to tell the city I love, that I will leave the job that I love,” .He said at the time that after his illnesses in 2012 he could not keep up his grueling “Menino schedule” and he didn’t want to do the job at less than full speed.“I miss hitting every event, ribbon cutting, new homeowner’s dinner, school play, and chance meeting,” he said at the event. “Spending so much time in the neighborhoods gives me energy. Being with our residents builds our trust. It may not be the only way to lead Boston, but it’s the only way for me.”He said he was “humbled and grateful” for the chance to serve as mayor and “I will be very proud if I have changed our city in some ways that last.” Menino’s decision to suspend his cancer treatments and book tour took many by surprise.  “After the years he gave this city, it’s too bad that he’s not really getting a chance to enjoy his retirement,’",

Shaheen listed several bills Brown voted against that she said helped New Hampshire companies, and said he voted to give tax incentives to companies that ship jobs overseas.‘‘We don’t need to import a candidate who’s going to outsource our jobs,’’ she said, repeating one of her applause lines from a Democratic Party fundraiser last week.Brown countered that small businesses are being hurt by the health care overhaul law Shaheen supports. He wants to repeal the law and argues that states could develop their own plans to make health care more affordable and accessible. Shaheen said Brown wants to force thousands of people to lose coverage and return to a time when insurance companies could deny coverage based on pre-existing conditions.
Former secretary of state Hillary Rodham Clinton stood with Martha Coakley on Friday, urging supporters to spend the next 11 days telling everyone they can to vote for Coakley for governor. “We cannot possibly rest between now and Nov. 4,” Clinton told the crowd. “You don’t want to wake up the day after this election and say, ‘I wish I could have done more.’\u2009”\n\t\nMore than 1,500 stalwart Coakley supporters, some of whom had traveled from Worcester and Lynn, packed into the Imperial Ballroom at the Park Plaza hotel, where they heard Clinton encourage them to “knock on doors. Send those e-mails. Make those phone calls. Talk to every voter you can find.”\n\nClinton’s appearance was one of many she has made for Democrats around the country this election season. Her Friday schedule also included an appearance for US Representative Mike Michaud, the Democratic candidate for governor in Maine. Next weekend, she plans to appear at a rally for US Senator Jeanne Shaheen in New Hampshire. Clinton and Coakley were joined by Governor Deval Patrick, US Senators Elizabeth Warren and  Edward J. Markey, and Coakley’s running mate, Steve Kerrigan. Just before the rally began, Clinton held a fund-raiser with Coakley at the Park Plaza that raised $500,000.Each speaker ticked off the issues — from early education to earned sick time to improving infrastructure to women’s reproductive rights — that they said distinguish Coakley from her Republican rival, Charlie Baker. “Republicans today care about the folks who are already comfortable,” Patrick said. “Democrats are about helping people find the path to get comfortable. That is the difference.”And while Friday’s rally was about helping Coakley beat Baker, who, according to the most recent Globe poll, leads her by 9 percentage points, there were moments when Clinton widened the aperture of the lens.“This is one of those election years that will really set the stage for what comes here and in Massachusetts and around the country,” she said. Clinton praised Patrick, the Democratic ticket, and the state’s congressional delegation. She was effusive in her praise of Warren, whom she called a “passionate champion for working people and middle-class families.”“I love watching Elizabeth giving it to those who deserve to get it,” she said. There has been much speculation about Warren making a run for the White House in 2016, which raises the prospect of squaring off against Clinton, who is widely seen as the front-runner for the Democratic nomination, should she decide to run. Warren, though, has repeatedly dismissed the notion of a presidential bid in 2016. But Friday was about Coakley, and those standing with her seemed undeterred by Baker’s recent surge in public polls. The campaign said its internal polling shows the race within 2 points.“We are in a dead heat,” Coakley told the raucous group of supporters. “And I promise you, we are going to win this race.”Coakley said she would be victorious because of the energy and enthusiasm of her supporters, while outlining what she saw as grave consequences if Baker is elected. “We will see budgets cuts, services cut, crucial jobs cut, or maybe even outsourced,” she said. “Charlie Baker has spent a lot of a lot of time in this race talking about his record creating jobs. He just forgot to tell you they’re in India.”When the nearly two-hour rally was over, those present said they were fired up. “This is the first time I came to this type of event, and I am ready to knock on doors right now,” said Doris Cristobal, who lives in Lynn. Nov. 4 will be the first time the Peruvian native will vote as an American citizen. “As a worker, I am cleaning offices, and she supports me,” said Cristobal, who was holding an oversized campaign sign. “Minimum wage. Earned sick time. She supports me.”Eileen Kenner of Dorchester said seeing so many powerful women on stage was long overdue. It’s time the state had its first elected female governor and female president, she said.“Women have to collaborate; we have to unite,” said Kenner, who was wearing a head wrap and matching skirt adorned with American flags.Coakley, she said, is the candidate to ensure economic development comes to urban communities. “Those who have selective amnesia can look at the record and see,” she said of those people considering Baker. Baker, a former health care executive, hasn’t leaned on high-wattage Republicans for public events as Coakley has with Democrats, though he did enlist former presidential candidate Mitt Romney for a recent private fund-raiser.On the Democratic side, in addition to the state’s leading Democrats — Warren and Patrick are campaign trail regulars — top national figures have come out to support Coakley’s campaign.Former president Bill Clinton rallied for her in Worcester. Michelle Obama sang her praises at the Strand Theatre in Dorchester. And Vice President Joe Biden will host a fund-raiser for Coakley Wednesday at the Banshee, a Dorchester Irish pub.Still, Baker and groups supporting him have been airing more broadcast television ads, spending more money on those ads, and, specialists say, reaching more viewers than Coakley and her allies — something that came up repeatedly during Friday’s rally. “They think they can buy this race,” Warren said. “Well, I want to be clear about one thing: Martha Coakley is not giving up. Martha Coakley is fighting back.”
 New York awoke this morning to fresh fears of Ebola after learning that a Manhattan resident has been diagnosed with the disease. Those fears were stoked by news that the patient — who caught Ebola in Guinea while working with Doctors without Borders — recently took a  from upper Manhattan to a bowling alley in Brooklyn, and opted for Uber on the way home. If Ebola were a more contagious disease, that night out could have laced the city with infection.  Consider the dozens of people in each subway car, the fact that each stop brings new hosts for the virus, or the sharing of bowling balls and bowling shoes. Fortunately, Ebola . It doesn’t thrive in crowds or readily jump between hosts. Transmission requires close contact and an exchange of bodily fluids. Absent that, the risk to subway passengers and nearby bowlers is mercifully small. \n\n\n\n\t\nThe patient, Dr. Craig Spencer, . He’d been monitoring his temperature and watching for symptoms, even as he continued to move about the city and readjust to New York life.  On Tuesday, he apparently began feeling sluggish, but nothing more. Wednesday evening, he traveled from his home in upper Manhattan to the bowling alley in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Then Thursday morning, when he took his temperature, it was 100.3, at which he point he alerted officials and was taken to the hospital. \nAbsolutely.  Above all, it’s the close friends he has spent time with in recent days and the health care workers he’ll be spending time with for the next few.  \n\nSpencer’s fiancee has been quarantined at the same hospital where he is being treated. Two other friends have been told to place themselves in quarantine. \n\nLast month, when a patient with Ebola showed up in Dallas, a  sent him back into the community, where he remained for several days before proper treatment began. And yet, it wasn’t the people he stayed with who contracted the disease, it was two of the nurses who treated him. Ebola becomes more contagious as patients get sicker. So the people who face the greatest risk are the ones who care for the patient until the end. In West Africa, that has meant family members who prepare their loved ones’",

4916,Michael Ray,"""When Sam Amidon opened his midday set at the FreshGrass festival in North Adams last month with the apocalyptic warning “I See the Sign,” he introduced it as a song about the “near future.”He sang, in his moaning sunbeam of a voice, of a riderless horse and two angels on a chariot wheel. His gentle acoustic guitar pattern was complemented by an eerie bed of electronics and light drumming from an accompanist. Amidon might have been warning of any calamity, from the past or imminent future, or perhaps only in his own mind. It was cosmic and domestic, real and imagined: the last dream of the morning, before you wake up and are confused momentarily about what is real.\n\t\nThe song originated as a group sing-along in African-American communities on the Georgia coast. But it felt like a fresh message the singer desperately needed to share, which could be disregarded only at one’s peril.“I’m not a conceptual person; I’m much more reliant on accident,” Amidon says of his creative approach, on the phone heading for a gig in Northampton. “But it has to be a real, personal thing emanating from yourself.” (Amidon plays Club Passim on Saturday.)Amidon’s work is highly idiosyncratic, but seems to follow neatly from the sum of his influences. Born in Brattleboro to folksinging parents Peter and Mary Alice Amidon, he started learning fiddle when he was 3. Then and now, Peter and Mary Alice were known as performers and teachers of folk music, storytelling, and liturgical singing.Sam made the rounds of New England folk festivals as a child, he says, but not with the mindset of a rising-star performer.“Their version of folk music was about community and music making, not somebody standing on a stage in front of an audience,” Amidon, 33, says of his parents. “They really just made folk music part of the life fabric, and that was true of many people in our community. I grew up in a town where there were a lot of people who moved to this area who loved to get together to play fiddle songs, or sing Sacred Harp songs.”Nevertheless, his talent garnered attention. When he was a teenager, his band Popcorn Behavior was booked to play contra-dance events around the country. (A 16-year-old Sam was even interviewed about the band for the National Public Radio program “All Things Considered.”)It wasn’t until his teenage years that Amidon found a rock band that interested him: Phish. A 1996 free-improvisation record by frontman Trey Anastasio with an ensemble culled from some of New York’s finest out-there jazz players was a revelation. Amidon stocked up on Sun Ra albums and other recordings featuring personnel from the Anastasio album like Marc Ribot, Michael Ray, and John Medeski. Ornette Coleman followed. The young Vermont folkie was launched into space.Moving to New York, he found himself playing in indie rock and psych-folk bands, and getting calls to play fiddle or banjo on other musicians’ studio sessions. Otherwise, he hadn’t found much of a community there, and spent a lot of time at home, singing lonesome folk songs that fit his mood.When he started writing musical fragments and singing folk lyrics over them, Amidon hit upon the “little magic key” that enabled him to merge traditional music and the more-experimental sounds he’d come to love. Murder ballads, church songs, and all the haunted stuff of Appalachian folk became a meeting ground for Amidon and his forward-looking cohorts. \nThe rising new-music composer Nico Muhly, producer Valgeir Sigurdsson (Björk, Bonnie “Prince” Billy), multi-instrumentalist Shahzad Ismaily, and others associated with the Icelandic label Bedroom Community became key collaborators. For his album “Lily-O,” released on Nonesuch in September, Amidon turned to the much-admired jazz-ish guitarist Bill Frisell.“I have a love for and am familiar with many of these old tunes, but had never heard them done in this way,” Frisell writes in an e-mail. “Sam’s way. He makes them his own, staying true, but transforming them, from the inside out, bringing them into the present. He is an inspiration to me.”Whether he employs ominous electronic accents or simply calls on small-group backing, Amidon amplifies rather than obscures the spirit of his source material with his revisionist arrangements. When he leans toward a more traditional reading, he accomplishes it with authority. Complementing his work on guitar, banjo, and fiddle, his voice rings with a removed loneliness, colored by the clean, sweet texture he practiced singing hymns as a boy.\nAmidon says he’s not a singer-songwriter, but a “re-worker” who makes his own statement through an inherited filter. “Theres a dual quality to the folk song,” he says. “Theyre extremely alien, because they’re from this whole other world that we’re not in, and they have all these strange elements that are confusing. But at the same time, they have this quality that’s just so personal and close. That’s what keeps me going.”\n\n• \n• \n• \n""",

4980,Chelsea,"""Lauren Baker learned how to pitch products like Labatt beer and Lotus Notes during her 13 years as an executive at a prominent Boston advertising agency. During the last year, she has been sitting in on strategy meetings, reviewing rough cuts and scripts for television ads, and crafting the marketing toward women for a brand much closer to her heart: her husband, Charlie Baker, the Republican candidate for governor.\n\t\nAfter staying on the sidelines during his 2010 run for governor, she has taken on a much larger role in this campaign, as a key voice shaping her husband’s message and as an outspoken leader in his drive to cut into Martha Coakleys lead among women voters.“Last time, I kind of felt like I was all out,” she said. “This time, I want to be all in.”Baker said she is fascinated by political strategy and familiar with media and communications as a former account executive at Hill Holliday, where she worked until 1999, when she quit to become a stay-at-home mother.“When there’s communication, or direct mail, or TV, or video, or even just the logo or the branding of Charlie, I want to be involved in that because I think I understand both the brand — the person — and the process,” she said. Privately, she also urged her husband to run again after his defeat four years ago. “The day after we lost last time, I looked at him and I’m like, ‘Let me at ’em,’\u2009” she said. “We have to do this again because we learned so much and we made so many mistakes.”Now, she is active in the campaign every day, speaking at fund-raisers and house parties, writing a weekly newsletter to female supporters, recording YouTube videos, and stumping alone and alongside her husband.At a recent Women for Charlie event in West Roxbury — one of 50 she has hosted across the state — she mixed homespun anecdotes about the travails of day care pickup with some sharp jabs at Coakley’s efforts to win women’s votes.“I believe she is going to play that gender card really, really hard,” Lauren Baker said. “I, frankly, think it’s insulting that any political group would assume that women would vote for a woman because she’s a woman.”The crowd of about 30 women broke into applause. Later, asked about the battle for women’s votes in an interview, she was just as plain-spoken. “The first thing is: There’s no war on women,” she said. “I just find that insulting. It’s dumb.” At that point, the campaign manager, Jim Conroy, cut in, insisting she go off the record.Baker is valuable to the campaign not only because of her advertising experience, but because she has known the candidate for 30 years and can help soften the hard-edged image he cultivated in 2010 when he tried to tap into voter anger at Beacon Hill.The two met in the fall of 1984, at the business school at Northwestern University, when she looked out on the first day of Strategy D30 class and said, “that’s the guy.”“He was the guy who always sat in the first row with his hand up all the time, answering questions,” she said at the Women for Charlie event. “I was in the back row thinking, ‘Please, don’t call on me.’\u2009”They  and now have three children: Charlie Jr., 23; A.J., 20; and Caroline, 17.When she quit her job in 1999, she said she had been looking for a change and needed to spend more time with her children. Her husband had just become chief executive of Harvard Vanguard Medical Associates and was “never around,” she said. Though she became active in charitable work, she said it was hard giving up her career.“It’s difficult when you’ve been a working person and then, all of a sudden, you’re a stay-at-home mom, and people say, ‘Well what do you do?’ And you’re like, ‘Well, nothing,’\u2009” she said.Despite her husband’s well-publicized $1.7 million salary as chief executive of Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, she said the family also worries about affording college and retirement. It was one of the main concerns she had about him quitting Harvard Pilgrim in 2009 to run for governor the first time.“Are we making a huge mistake?” she said, recalling her fears at the time. “We’ve got three kids going to college. We’re not millionaires. We don’t have our retirement paid for. We’ve got to save money.”During that race, she devoted about one day a week to the campaign so she could spend most of her time with their children.“I felt they needed me to be there for them, and I was determined not to let any of the negativity of the campaign infiltrate their lives,” she said. “And I didn’t want them to feel neglected because they never saw their dad.”Now, the children are older (Caroline has appeared in an ad, saying “he’s totally pro-choice,”) and Lauren Baker has become a frequent speaker at campaign events, testifying to her husband’s qualities as a father. In West Roxbury, she recounted that, when he was a top budget aide in the Weld administration in the 1990s, he would leave work in the evenings to feed, bathe, and put the children to bed.“So when people try to tell you that Charlie can’t relate to the trials and tribulations of being a working mother – trust me, he knows, because he lived it,” she said.Research shows these kinds of messages, called “maternal appeals,” are most effective on behalf of Republican men, who are more likely to be viewed as lacking compassion, said Jill S. Greenlee, a Brandeis University political scientist.“It’s much easier to have your family talking about this beautiful personal story than to talk about policy that affects women and take more controversial stances,” Greenlee said. “This is, in many ways, a safe strategy for his campaign.” Baker also fields questions about policy, and jots down voters’ concerns in a notebook that she takes back to the campaign staff. In West Roxbury, she received a warm response.“The fact that she could speak to the issue of women, and how so many politicians use the woman card and the female card to garner votes, was really impressive to me,” said Diane McNamara, who works in public relations and attended the event. “As a feminist, I don’t want to be labeled as someone who will vote for you only because youre a woman.”Sandy Averill, a retired employee at WLVI-TV, said she also appreciated hearing from the candidate’s spouse: “She’s so friendly, she’s so bubbly; she’s very real.”Baker said she knows she is battling against Democratic efforts to depict her husband as a ruthless corporate executive. So she begged the women at the event to defend her husband, saying “we need you, desperately, to be the truth squad.”“If there’s a woman who doesn’t support Charlie,” she said, “it’s because she doesn’t know him.”\n\n""",

If safety tests are successful, the company hopes to begin large clinical trials in May 2015.The two leading Ebola vaccines in the pipeline have largely been funded by government efforts, but their testing is being completed by a combination of corporate and public financing.Human trials of a vaccine co-developed by the US National Institutes of Health and GlaxoSmithKline are being funded by the company, its charitable trust, and funds from the US and UK governments. It is being tested for safety in the United States, United Kingdom, and Mali. GSK said it might be able to make about 1 million doses of its vaccine per month by the end of 2015, assuming that some logistical and regulatory hurdles can be overcome.A small US drugmaker, NewLink Genetics, holds the license on the second front-runner vaccine, developed by the Public Health Agency of Canada and sent to Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in Maryland for testing on volunteers, with preliminary safety results expected by December.Dr. Marie-Paule Kieny from the UN health agency told reporters last week that millions of doses could be available in 2015 in West Africa if early tests proved the two leading experimental vaccines are safe and provoke enough of an immune response to protect people\n.
SALEM — “If you’re going to have a war,” a South African colonel remarked once to Jo Ractliffe, “it’s best to do it in someone else’s country.” He was referring to Angola, the subject of the photographs in “Someone Else’s Country,” Ractliffe’s show. It runs at the Peabody Essex Museum through March 15.For almost 30 years, the former Portuguese colony was a Cold War plaything. The Soviet Union and Cuba, on one side, and the United States and South Africa, on the other, fought there by proxy. Notwithstanding that it has a lot of oil, Angola’s geopolitical significance proved nil. Which makes all the ghastlier the fact that 1.5 million Angolans died and another 4.5 million were displaced. \n\t\nThe fighting ended in 2002. Eight million undetonated land mines remain. Their continuing impact can be gauged by the existence of an Angolan Miss Landmine Survivor beauty contest. That sounds like a grotesque joke. It’s not. The contest’s purpose is to publicize the many casualties the mines still cause. Perhaps the single most startling photograph in “Someone Else’s Country” shows a figure who looks like Robbie the Robot standing in an open field. It’s a man wearing a protective suit like the one Jeremy Renner wears in “The Hurt Locker.” He’s searching for mines.That photograph is atypical. Ractliffe has a gift for visual understatement. There’s a dryness to these images, a restraint, which makes them that much more potent. Showing the receding of terrible things in no way masks their terribleness. What it does do is make it likelier that others — us — might dwell on them and come to grasp their significance.A South African, Ractliffe writes that Angola was “abstract” and “a place of myth” for her, “little more than a vague and distant elsewhere. In the late ’70s and early ’80s, it was simply ‘The Border,’ a secret location where brothers and boyfriends were sent as part of their military service.”The 44 images in “Someone Else’s Country” are part of Ractliffe’s effort to find the reality beneath the myth. She seeks to make that elsewhere a here. Ractliffe took the photographs on visits to Angola in 2007, 2009, and 2010. The distance between Johannesburg and Luanda, the Angolan capital, is considerable: 1,500 miles. As Ractliffe shows, it’s not insuperable.The photographs are black and white. Color would be overpowering. The difference between color and black and white is the difference between a fresh wound and one that’s been dressed. Dressed is not the same thing as healed. Nor is dressing what interests Ractliffe; addressing is. These photographs are at once clear-eyed and heavy-hearted.The memory of violence and weight of the mundane come together in these images to create a consistent air of mystery. Ractliffe shows us what’s there that can be seen only partially by the eye, and that needs memory for completion. She doesn’t preach. She mourns and marvels — one can marvel at the awful no less than at the good. Which is another way of saying she bears witness. Taking herself to “The Border,” Ractliffe brings us there, too.A man wearing a beret dominates the foreground of a photograph. He’s looking backward at a woman carrying a baby. Mist or smoke fills the air behind her. Is the man a soldier? A policeman? We can’t see his expression. Is he looking at the woman and child affectionately? Protectively? Appraisingly? One’s answer depends on how much of the past gets superimposed on the present.A clothing vendor has suspended a half dozen dark suits from a tree. The image has a surreal charm — or it would if it didn’t bear such a resemblance to a set of hung bodies. (In a nice visual rhyme, the image chimes with another photograph in the show, of schoolgirls’",

It’s dumb.” At that point, the campaign manager, Jim Conroy, cut in, insisting she go off the record.Baker is valuable to the campaign not only because of her advertising experience, but because she has known the candidate for 30 years and can help soften the hard-edged image he cultivated in 2010 when he tried to tap into voter anger at Beacon Hill.The two met in the fall of 1984, at the business school at Northwestern University, when she looked out on the first day of Strategy D30 class and said, “that’s the guy.”“He was the guy who always sat in the first row with his hand up all the time, answering questions,” she said at the Women for Charlie event. “I was in the back row thinking, ‘Please, don’t call on me.’\u2009”They  and now have three children: Charlie Jr., 23; A.J., 20; and Caroline, 17.When she quit her job in 1999, she said she had been looking for a change and needed to spend more time with her children. Her husband had just become chief executive of Harvard Vanguard Medical Associates and was “never around,” she said. Though she became active in charitable work, she said it was hard giving up her career.“It’s difficult when you’ve been a working person and then, all of a sudden, you’re a stay-at-home mom, and people say, ‘Well what do you do?’ And you’re like, ‘Well, nothing,’\u2009” she said.Despite her husband’s well-publicized $1.7 million salary as chief executive of Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, she said the family also worries about affording college and retirement. It was one of the main concerns she had about him quitting Harvard Pilgrim in 2009 to run for governor the first time.“Are we making a huge mistake?” she said, recalling her fears at the time. “We’ve got three kids going to college. We’re not millionaires. We don’t have our retirement paid for. We’ve got to save money.”During that race, she devoted about one day a week to the campaign so she could spend most of her time with their children.“I felt they needed me to be there for them, and I was determined not to let any of the negativity of the campaign infiltrate their lives,” she said. “And I didn’t want them to feel neglected because they never saw their dad.”Now, the children are older (Caroline has appeared in an ad, saying “he’s totally pro-choice,”) and Lauren Baker has become a frequent speaker at campaign events, testifying to her husband’s qualities as a father. In West Roxbury, she recounted that, when he was a top budget aide in the Weld administration in the 1990s, he would leave work in the evenings to feed, bathe, and put the children to bed.“So when people try to tell you that Charlie can’t relate to the trials and tribulations of being a working mother – trust me, he knows, because he lived it,” she said.Research shows these kinds of messages, called “maternal appeals,” are most effective on behalf of Republican men, who are more likely to be viewed as lacking compassion, said Jill S. Greenlee, a Brandeis University political scientist.“It’s much easier to have your family talking about this beautiful personal story than to talk about policy that affects women and take more controversial stances,” Greenlee said. “This is, in many ways, a safe strategy for his campaign.” Baker also fields questions about policy, and jots down voters’ concerns in a notebook that she takes back to the campaign staff. In West Roxbury, she received a warm response.“The fact that she could speak to the issue of women, and how so many politicians use the woman card and the female card to garner votes, was really impressive to me,” said Diane McNamara, who works in public relations and attended the event. “As a feminist, I don’t want to be labeled as someone who will vote for you only because youre a woman.”Sandy Averill, a retired employee at WLVI-TV, said she also appreciated hearing from the candidate’s spouse: “She’s so friendly, she’s so bubbly; she’s very real.”Baker said she knows she is battling against Democratic efforts to depict her husband as a ruthless corporate executive. So she begged the women at the event to defend her husband, saying “we need you, desperately, to be the truth squad.”“If there’s a woman who doesn’t support Charlie,” she said, “it’s because she doesn’t know him.”\n\n""",

During the last year, she has been sitting in on strategy meetings, reviewing rough cuts and scripts for television ads, and crafting the marketing toward women for a brand much closer to her heart: her husband, Charlie Baker, the Republican candidate for governor.\n\t\nAfter staying on the sidelines during his 2010 run for governor, she has taken on a much larger role in this campaign, as a key voice shaping her husband’s message and as an outspoken leader in his drive to cut into Martha Coakleys lead among women voters.“Last time, I kind of felt like I was all out,” she said. “This time, I want to be all in.”Baker said she is fascinated by political strategy and familiar with media and communications as a former account executive at Hill Holliday, where she worked until 1999, when she quit to become a stay-at-home mother.“When there’s communication, or direct mail, or TV, or video, or even just the logo or the branding of Charlie, I want to be involved in that because I think I understand both the brand — the person — and the process,” she said.

On Halloween, the scariest things aren’t goblins or witches. No, what’s frightening is that Pottery Barn is charging $179 for an enormous horse-shaped ghost. Crate & Barrel’s Spooky Lighted Tree seems a relative bargain at $99.95.Yes, it’s easy to deride Oct. 31 as a consumer-crazed holiday. In fact, according to the National Retail Federation, a record number of Americans will buy Halloween costumes this year. We’ll spend an average of $77.52 on an outfit, and a hefty national total of $1\u2009billion will be spent on kids’ costumes alone. That’s a lot of Elsa wigs.\n\t\nFrivolous? Maybe. But some \nsay that Halloween serves a crucial purpose, channeling community spirit — not deadly ones — in a hectic world. This is thanks in part to Gen X parents raised on “Aliens” and “Friday the 13th,” who grew up celebrating Halloween with more fiendish gusto than their own parents ever did.“I think the volume of kids trick-or-treating has changed over the years,” says Boston Police Sergeant Michael McCarthy, who helps spearhead family-focused Halloween events citywide. This year, he estimates that a record 800 children visited Dorchester’s Haunted Forest at Geneva Cliffs, co-sponsored by the Boston Police Department.“There are a lot more families coming out, and parents seem more enthusiastic and appreciative,” he says.It wasn’t always so. “My parents could care less what we wore. We literally went to Woolworth’s, grabbed a mask and cape, and called it a day,” says Rory Earley, who plans to attend several celebrations in Beacon Hill with her young son.Winchester’s Terry Marotta, now a grandparent, trick-or-treated in Dorchester in the 1950s. “Kids went out on their own. Grown-ups didn’t know,” she recalls. “We wandered like little nomads from house to house dressed as witches and found out who had the good snacks, and tried to trick people by going to the same house twice in a different costume,” Marotta laughs.Jill Hegstad, buyer at Boston-based children’s shop Magic Beans, sees parents happily replaying Halloween memories through their offspring’s attire. “We’re seeing a lot more costumes driven by nostalgia on the part of the parents, things like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,” she says, though her shop doesn’t carry them. (The National Retail Federation says that retro icons like the Turtles and Spider-Man are among this year’s top costumes.)Matthew Stahl, principal at Lowell’s Pawtucketville Memorial Elementary School, also sees a reversion to bygone days. “My personal feeling is that Halloween had gone a bit extreme, super scary and gory, and a lot of today’s parents are moving away from it,” he says.His school holds a Halloween assembly that’s decidedly non-ghoulish: Children pick a costume and match it to a vocabulary word, which they write on an index card and wear. “Instead of someone being a ‘mean’ pirate, they’re ‘ferocious.’ Or a princess is ‘exquisite,’” he says. Speaking of nostalgia, one of Stahl’s children plans to dress as 1980s icon My Little Pony.The costumes are Gen X, and festivities cater to the Gen Xers, too. This year at Fenway Park, for instance, parents are invited to trick-or-treat with their children at the sensible hour of 3 p.m. on Oct. 30, followed by a screening of the 1980s classic “Ghostbusters.”It’s a far cry from the days of tykes marauding through the streets in face paint and homemade fangs.“Halloween is more of a community holiday,” says Arlington’s Sharron Kirchain, who plans to accompany her kids to a Halloween party with a classic Marvel comics theme. “Everyone goes out into the neighborhood. Even if some of the costumes or decorations are over the top, it’s a good thing. It gets people talking,” And if there’s too much candy? Sugar highs are also a thing of the past. There are buy-back programs at shops like Magic Beans, which offers families a shopping discount in exchange for excess sweets. Kids get a toy, candy gets donated, and parents needn’t cope with meltdowns. \nEven some Halloween costumes are designed with sensible parents in mind. At Magic Beans, Hegstad stocks Melissa & Doug costumes with themes that are suitable for year-round wear, like chefs and fairies. This way, they’re not tossed out like that old Werther’s Original from your grumpy neighbor’s candy bucket.But lest we worry that Halloween is becoming too civilized, it’s still hard work for the modern parent.“I’m not joking when I say my son has five Halloween parties to attend before Halloween even starts,” says Earley. “And I’m pretty sure his peers have multiple costumes. What, are we at the Oscars with all these outfit changes?”\n
""""""Like many US cities grappling with globalization, Boston has been hemorrhaging industrial jobs for decades. But the shift in the city’s economy to knowledge-based industries such as life sciences and technology has provided new business opportunities for boutique manufacturers that use 3-D printers and other sophisticated equipment.If only those companies had a place of their own in Boston.\n\t\nThe rapid redevelopment of former industrial areas such as the Seaport District has left Boston with less than 5 percent of its land zoned for just industrial uses. Now, at an abandoned rail yard on the outskirts of the city, officials hope a new project will help them lure industry back to Boston.The “Yard 5” development is a group of low-slung buildings that will be built on former MBTA land in Hyde Park that will offer studio-sized industrial workspaces, each from 4,000 to 7,000 square feet, to as many as 51 businesses. The developers expect to receive the go-ahead from City Hall soon, and already Boston officials are shopping the Yard 5 units to prospective tenants around the country, telling companies that the development shows Boston is serious about restoring its industrial sector.“We want to bring manufacturing jobs back to the city,” said John Barros, Boston’s chief of economic development. “If we’re not paying attention to those types of jobs, our economic ecosystem is weaker, and we’re not as attractive to these companies and institutions.”Yard 5 will consist of five one-story light-industrial buildings and a three-story office building. The studios will have robust high-voltage electrical systems, high ceilings, loading docks, and other features prized by industrial businesses.“Most of the manufacturing and industrial businesses in Boston own or lease functionally obsolete facilities, and have to rehab them at great expense to stay there,” said Matthew O’Connor, vice president at First Highland Management and Development Corp., the Yard 5 developer. “This is a rare opportunity to have a modern facility with a Boston address.”Work on the 21-acre site, the subject of an intensive environmental cleanup by the MBTA in 2011, is scheduled to begin next March. Two buildings will be erected next year; construction of the remaining buildings should begin in spring 2017. First Highland, which already operates the Boston-Dedham Commerce Park nearby, said the project would create 100 temporary construction jobs.O’Connor expects to draw a diverse mix of small businesses, from medical device makers and robotics companies, general contractors, and other building trades. He thinks the project’s modest-sized units and location across from the Readville commuter rail station will be particularly attractive to companies that do “smart” industrial work, such as product development and prototypes, and are trying to hire young people from local universities who want to live in the city.“Yard 5 is on a micro scale, and that’s appealing,” said Kevin Hanna, a principal at real estate firm Cassidy Turley who specializes in industrial and commercial properties. “For people trying to develop products, being able to perfect it locally where the brainpower is — that’s very interesting.”In First Highland’s pitch to city regulators, the company suggested the project’s modular, customizable units could be ideal “makerspaces.” These are workshops shared by a rotating cast of artisans and inventors who pay membership fees to use the space and equipment. Others in the region are thriving: In Somerville, the nonprofit Artisan’s Asylum has attracted a roster full of small manufacturing firms whose employees “hack” bicycles, tinker with robots, and brew beer in its warehouse space.“The makerspace movement is real, and if you dont have light industrial space for them, you’re going to lose those businesses,” Barros said, explaining that a recent visit to Industry City, a campus of historic warehouses in Brooklyn that have been converted into industrial space for startups and artists, had left him feeling jealous. “We’d be foolish not to include them in our planning.”But some involved in the makerspace movement are doubtful that Yard 5 will be a fit for these business; a makerspace, they argue, doesn’t start with empty buildings, but a community of tinkerers.“What startups need is not space. It’s knowledge and connections more than anything,” said Rich Breault, founder of Lightspeed Manufacturing, which collaborates with the MassChallenge accelerator program to help young companies manufacture products. “I’m sure there are economic advantages to being down there from a cost standpoint, but where’s the advice, support, and guidance? It’s all about the community and building a team.”Breault suggested Yard 5 would be a better fit for more mature startups that have completed a round or two of fund-raising and have a well-developed product. He worried that the somewhat remote location of Yard 5 — in a far corner of the city with few of the restaurants and street life the startup community thrives on — could be a turnoff.Yard 5 may eventually seem less removed if more frequent light-rail service, expected to begin at Readville station in 2018, comes to fruition.\n“It’s a lot about the talent and demographics,” said Hanna, the broker. “I’ve seen plenty of similar developments succeed in the suburbs, but young people want to live in the city.”First Highland, Hanna said, “could be onto something.”\n""""""
LYNN — Vice President Joe Biden and Seth Moulton, the Democratic nominee for the Sixth Congressional District, struck a populist note as they rallied supporters inside a YMCA gymnasium to turn out the vote for Democrats at Tuesday’s election.Appealing to the working-class ethos of Lynn, a city Moulton lost in the September primary, Biden focused on income inequality and restoring opportunity to all Americans.\n\t\n“There used to be a level playing field,” Biden told the crowd of about 500 people. “There used to be a basic bargain in America supported by Republicans and Democrats alike. If you contributed to the success of the enterprise you worked with .\xa0.\xa0. you got to share in the profit.”The bargain has been broken and increasingly skewed to favor the rich, the vice president said. During Ronald Reagan’s presidency, a chief executive made an average of 42 times a worker’s wages, he said; today, he takes home 331 times the employee’s pay.“Restoring the bargain is the defining issue of our time,” Biden said.Moulton, a Harvard graduate who served four tours in Iraq before getting a dual graduate degree from Harvard’s Business School and Kennedy School of Government, focused on similar themes, demanding equal pay for women and minorities and increased resources for fellow veterans.“I won’t mince words: Veterans’",
5185,Moulton,“Your chance at success in life should not be dictated by the ZIP code in which you’re born.”,
5186,Moulton,"“Like me, he wasn’t born in privilege, but he’s had a passion for serving others his entire life. He’s someone who — no matter where he is — he never forgets the families that he’s served.”",
5187,Moulton,"“represents so much of what’s right in America. It’s a place where anyone can come to work, play, and be a part of the community. It’s a place where anyone can come for help. It’s a place where we take care of one another.”",
5188,Moulton,"“A year ago, not many of us imagined we would all be here today,”",
5189,Biden,“But we are here because we believe that we can help change Washington with some new leaders and new ideas.”,
5190,Biden,"“It shows how close this race is and the fact that we have the momentum,”",
5191,Sutter,"“We do not respond to personal attacks, especially where the very issue before the court is the extent of media sensationalism surrounding the present case,”",
5192,Sutter,"“To the extent that both the Tsarnaev and Hernandez change of venue motions raise the same basic legal issues, we were required to cite the same Supreme Court cases setting out the governing law as the US Attorney’s Office.

5201,Tom Menino,"""\n\n Alison McCartan and Victor L. Shopov excel as a pair of cousins whose competition for a precious family heirloom escalates into a no-holds-barred battle over questions of Jewish culture, identity, and faith. Joshua Harmon’s dark comedy is skillfully directed by Rebecca Bradshaw. \n\n The 22-year-old Elizabeth Milanovich, who graduated from Emerson College a few months ago, delivers a memorable performance as a young Serbian woman forced to work as a prostitute in London. Directed by Maureen Shea, this production of Lucy Kirkwood’s drama also features the always-welcome Obehi Janice. \n\n\t\nDON AUCOIN\n Aditi Brennan Kapil displaces the Hindu gods Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva to America and makes them female (well, 2½ of them) in this trilogy of plays that rank high for humor and imagination. The humor can be a little hollow in the stand-up show “Brahman/i,” and “Shiv” occasionally gets stuck in its own apparent autobiography, but “The Chronicles of Kalki” is tough, funny, and graced by four exceptionally spontaneous actors. All worthwhile, but if you’re seeing just one, “Kalki” is it. \n\n Sarah Ruhls 2012 play boils down the 800 or so pages of letters between Robert Lowell and Elizabeth Bishop to two hours, but you can learn a lot about their friendship if you read between the lines, and that’s easy to do in this Lyric Stage production, which is imaginatively directed by A. Nora Long and given vivid, specific life by Laura Latreille as Bishop and Ed Hoopman as Lowell. \nJEFFREY GANTZ\nThis piece by the London-based troupe Complicite is devised theater working at a very high level, convincingly rendered here in this local production. The time-shifting experiment in form is nominally about a pair of influential mathematicians and their latter-day admirer, but it is really a tone poem, a nonlinear collage of images, sounds, ideas, motivic conceits, and mere shards of narrative. It’s not a ripping yarn, but audience members willing to be immersed in its brainy dream-logic will be rewarded. \nJEREMY GOODWIN\n\n This spirited, internationally acclaimed troupe is hip, hot, and versatile, with works ranging in style from ballet to street dance. The company brings the world premiere of “Rouge,” by Grupo Corpo choreographer Rodrigo Pederneiras, as well as the Boston premieres of Benjamin Millepied’s lyrical “Closer” and Andonis Foniadakis’s “Kosmos.” \n\n Boston Ballet unveils the world premiere of artistic director Mikko Nissinen’s take on the beloved ballet, with new designs by Robert Perdziola. Nissinen says his new choreography respects the timeless classicism of the familiar Petipa/Ivanov original while refreshing (and shortening) the ballet for contemporary audiences. \n\n This collaborative benefit reflects new leadership and a new symbiotic relationship between Green Street Studios and the Dance Complex. The concert, which starts at Green Street then moves to the Dance Complex, features performances by Dance Complex director Peter DiMuro and GSS director Lorraine Chapman, as well as Anna Myer and Dancers, and David Parker and the Bang Group. \n\n Bessie Award winners Jennifer Nugent and Paul Matteson (both formerly of Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane Dance Company) collaborate with Peter DiMuro and Wendy Woodson in this program of new duets and solos to commemorate All Saints’ Day. \nKAREN CAMPBELL\n\n What can the camera see that the eye cannot? Curator Lexi Lee Sullivan taps photographers and video artists such as Abelardo Morell, David Prifti, and Suara Welitoff, whose works are tinged by magic and mystery. \n\n This artist’s painting/sculpture hybrids cavort and pun. As they explore perception, artifice, and the slippery construction of truth, they invite us to examine how we make meaning, and whether meaning can be relied upon. \n\n Photographers Antone Dolezal and Lara Shipley went home to the Ozarks to record oral history about Spook Light, a glowing sphere said to appear where the devil lives, and to photograph the place and its people. \nCATE MCQUAID\n\nOrganized by theme, this exhibition explores the full range of the great Spanish artist Francisco Goya’s prodigious output in paintings, prints, and drawings. Centered on the MFA’s deep collection of Goya works on paper, the exhibition also includes major loans from the Prado, the Uffizi, the Louvre, and the Metropolitan Museum. \n\nOrganized by the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, this show will feature more than 40 three-dimensional works by the giant of 20th-century modernism. It will include examples of the kinetic metal works Calder called “mobiles,” and the standing sculptures he called “stabiles.” \n\nMore than 40 paintings and many works on paper by Wifredo Lam, who was born in Cuba to parents of Chinese and African-Spanish descent and became a prominent modern artist. \n\nOrganized by the Denver Art Museum, this show presents an overview of six centuries of British art, and features work by artists such as Hans Holbein the Younger, Joseph Wright of Derby, John Constable, and Howard Hodgkin. \nSEBASTIAN SMEE\n\n In an exhibit at once futuristic and retro, three artists examine our relationship to outer space. Chris Cavallero, Tim McCool, and Alexander Squier depict relics left in space, astronauts, and possible settlements on other planets. Pictured: McCool’s “Space Dog amongst the stars.”  \nCATE MCQUAID""",

MEDFORD — Joseph McGill Jr. stood before the group to share his experiences sleeping in more than 60 slave quarters nationwide.What the African-American preservationist could not foresee was the stunning revelations that would unfold in a matter of hours.\n\t\nThree of the 10 guests who signed up to join McGill for a sleepover in the only freestanding slave quarters north of the Mason-Dixon line would acknowledge that their families enslaved Africans.“It’s a first,” said McGill, 53, calling it “a good thing.”\n“This is the highest concentration of descendants of slave owners that I have shared a space with overnight,” he added.McGill’s lecture on the \nhe founded and the overnight that followed were the culmination of the  annual Giving Voice program fund-raiser, in which donors paid $50 to hear McGill speak and $200 to sleep in the austere 18th-century Medford dwelling of the largest group of enslaved Africans in Massachusetts. “As a descendant of slave holders, I just feel I had to come and pay my respects,” said Reverend Fred Small, 61, a New Jersey native and senior minister of First Parish in Cambridge, a Unitarian Universalist church. “I was well into adulthood before I realized there were small numbers of slaves – enslaved Africans – owned by my New England ancestors.”He was not alone in mustering the courage to share the family secret and shame.Jamaica Plain poet Catherine Sasanov unearthed wills that proved title was held to 13 enslaved Africans in the Missouri Ozarks and up to 26 in Williamson County, Tenn.“In my great-great-great-grandfather’s will, he basically said, ‘Sell ’em and split ’em up,’\u2009” she said.Like Sasanov, Ellen Watters Sullivan, 58, of Eastham, has written about her family’s ties to slavery.She recalled her father, a print journalist during the Civil Rights Movement, taking her to their family’s ancestral home in rural northwest Georgia and seeing a big house — and the little house out back.“One of the things my father didn’t want to talk about was our slave-holding ancestry,” she said. “I knew there was something back there, but when I learned the extent, I was kind of shocked and devastated. It freaked me out.”Others — like Robert Wolff, a professor of slavery, abolition, and memory at Central Connecticut State University, and Dee Mallon, \na Newton textile artist — had other reasons to spend the night.“I’m not sure what I hope to get out of it,” said Wolff, 48. “I have faith there’s something to get.”For the last two years, Mallon, 57, has been writing a historical novel on indigo developer \nand three enslaved Africans she owned. “The minute I asked what were the lives of her slaves like, I just hit a wall,” Mallon told the group. “My research has taken me to some pretty remarkable places, including here.” Ifé Franklin of Roxbury admitted she had reservations about sharing space with people who could have owned members of her family.“I’m really surprised I don’t feel upset being in this room,” she said. “I’m here to listen and learn.”For Franklin, 54, who was one of the four African-Americans in the overnight group,  the chance to spend the night where her ancestors once slept filled her with gratitude. She presented McGill with a gift of a small-scale version of a slave cabin at the center of her first solo textile art exhibit, ”",

6204,Steele,"""A mother talks about her son, murdered by his childhood friends.A son describes finding his mother lying in a pool of blood after someone shot her in the face.\n\t\nA young girl acknowledges she wasted two years of her life in detention because she tried to shoot at a group of people.Their personal stories, interspersed with dramatic statistics about young men, are told in a  aimed at Boston middle school students.Suffolk District Attorney Daniel F. Conley and videographers from the University of Massachusetts Boston helped put together the stories as part of a curriculum called “Overcoming Violence” that is aimed at middle school students. A similar curriculum, “Understanding Violence,” was directed at both high school and middle school students in 2004.The new initiative focuses solely on middle school students, the age when many start thinking about dropping out of school or begin being influenced by the wrong friends.On Thursday morning, Conley, along with Mayor Martin J. Walsh and Suffolk County Sheriff Steven Tompkins and others, are scheduled to gather at Timilty Middle School in Roxbury to unveil a billboard promoting the new teaching tool, one of a dozen billboards that will hang around the city.“The overarching message is that a young person’s choices today have long-term consequences tomorrow, so we want them to make the right choices,” said Jake Wark, Conley’s spokesman.The video focuses on the stories of three people: Audrey Perkins, whose son Antoine was fatally shot in 2006; a young woman named Sameisha, who spent two years in detention at a Department of Youth Services facility; and Carlos, whose mother nearly died after an intruder shot her several times.In July 2006, Antoine Perkins left behind a 2-month-old son and a 7-year-old brother, his mother says in the video, when young men he grew up with shot him as he hung out on his porch.Audrey Perkins recalled rushing down to find him leaning over the railing.“Oh my God, Mummy, I can’t believe they shot me,” she said he told her. He died two days later.Sameishas father went to prison when she was only 8 years old, to serve a life term.Sameisha immediately began acting out: “Just fighting, taking my anger out on people, just doing crazy things.”In plain language, she tells the story of how she became incarcerated: “I pulled a gun on my girlfriend’s peoples.” They had been mocking her on Facebook and she became furious.“I pulled out the gun but it jammed and that was it,” she said. “I wasted two years of my life that I can’t get back.”The video concludes with the way each person has moved on: Audrey Perkins still struggles to raise her younger son, who never recovered from his brother’s death; Carlos went to college and became a teacher’s aide; and Sameisha got her GED and a part-time job.“When I get out of bed, my first thought is what am I going to do today?” Sameisha says. “What am I going to do different? What’s going to be my next move?”If a school accepts the “Overcoming Violence” curriculum, the program will last about six weeks, Wark said. In addition to watching the video, students will receive visits from law enforcement officials, such as prosecutors and police officers, who will hold discussions with them. Children will also visit jails like the Nashua Street Jail and the House of Correction, courts, and police stations.The program that was rolled out in 2004 eventually reached about 5,000 students, Wark said. The new program is not meant exclusively for students with discipline problems, he said.“It’s wide open,” Wark said. “It’s geared toward the Boston Public Schools. It’s for everyone. It’s not an effort to scare kids straight. It’s a teaching tool put into the context of a city kid’s life experience.”""",

6316,Sheehan,"""\n evin Washington had been president of Greater Boston YMCA for just six months when he startled trustees and branch directors with plan to cut membership fees by an average of 11 percent. Their reaction: “Are you crazy?”Washington forged ahead, confident in market research that projected lower dues would increase membership by 10,000 households and ultimately increase revenues. That estimate, however, proved wrong: The Y added 20,000.\n\t\nWashington “is somebody who would make a bet and take a step outside what the comfort zone would be for some leaders,” said Hope Aldrich, a Y director and chief executive of Eastern Insurance Group in Natick.Washington’s ability to think strategically, push boundaries, and see the big picture helped him nearly double the membership of the Greater Boston Y to more than 40,000 households and forge a common identity among what were 13 turf-conscious branches. Now, after four years, Washington is moving to Chicago in February to take the reins of the national Y, making history, as he did in Boston, as the first African-American to serve as the organizations chief executive.Selected in September from a field of 100 applicants, Washington will oversee a federation that serves 22 million people at 2,700 branches. He is already thinking big, hoping to expand a pilot academic program that last summer served 1,000 students to eventually reach 1 million.He aims to make the Y a national leader in diabetes prevention. And he wants to get out the message — listen up, philanthropists — that the Y is much more than “gym and swim.”* * *The YMCA has played a central role in Washington’s life for a half-century. The fourth of six children, he was raised by a father who worked as packer in a lamp factory and mother who occasionally did administrative work. They lived in a rough neighborhood in South Philadelphia that was afflicted by drugs and gangs.Every week, a man named Bill Morton would collect students at the local grade school to take them to the Christian Street YMCA, where he was he youth director. Among his recruits was a 10-year-old boy nicknamed Extension Cords because of his gangly arms. That was Kevin Washington.Morton kept the kids busy, learning to swim, playing ball, shooting pool. Washington gravitated to the basketball court, where he honed his game. Some kids Washington knew would succumb to the call of the streets, dying when they were barely out of their teens. Washington won a basketball scholarship to Temple University, and was the first in his family to attend college.“I wasn’t a bad kid, but he kept me from being one of those kids,” Washington said of the man he still refers to as Mr. Morton.* * *A few months after he graduated from Temple in 1978, Washington got a call from Morton, who was then executive director of the Christian Street Y. He hired Washington as youth director. Washington rose through the ranks, leaving the Philadelphia Y (where he met his wife) after 14 years to work in Chicago and then in Hartford, where he became the first black chief executive of the Y association.In Hartford, Washington defied conventional wisdom by expanding into one of the city’s most impoverished, crime-ridden neighborhoods with a new branch. Many believed it was crazy to invest in such a troubled area, recalled Christine Marcks, then a Hartford Y board member and now chairwoman of the national organization, Y-USA. But Washington insisted it was where the Y was needed most.“Kevin called it an oasis of safety for kids,” said Marcks, president of Prudential Retirement, a unit of the New Jersey insurance company. “It really has turned out as an oasis of safety in Hartford.”Defying doubters and deepening the Y’s role in the community would characterize Washington’s tenure in Boston, as well. Shortly after arriving in September 2010, he questioned why membership levels were lower than comparable YMCAs, such as those in San Francisco and Charlotte, N.C.He commissioned a market study that found potential members viewed price as the main obstacle to joining. Although the Y offered financial aid to lower-income residents, many were put off by the paperwork required to obtain to it. Others didn’t apply out of pride.Washington hired the study’s author, Mark Dengler, now executive vice president of operations, to put it into action. Fees were cut across the board, but most deeply at branches in lower-income neighborhoods. Membership surged, and overall revenues rose nearly 50 percent.Though some wondered if the Y could handle the influx, Washington later offered free membership to teens over the summer. More than 10,000 took him up on it. Once again, skeptics became believers.* * *Washington said he had no apprehensions about becoming the Greater Boston Y’s first black chief executive, though some friends questioned his decision because of the city’s turbulent racial past. But Washington soon found the problem wasn’t prejudice, but parochialism.In Philadelphia, people thought of themselves as Philadelphians, Washington said. But here, they identified themselves by neighborhoods, Charlestown, or Dorchester, or Roxbury. That proved an obstacle to Washington’s vision of one Y — “not the Oak Square Y, the Huntington, the Wang, but the YMCA of Greater Boston.”Complicating relations among branches were differences in finances: Some operated at deficits, others at surpluses. The better-off branches resented their money going to what they called “deficit Ys”; the less well-off viewed such attitudes as greedy.“It’s not a have or have not,” Washington would stress repeatedly. “It’s what we all have.”To ensure that the Y brand represented the same quality of services everywhere, Washington centralized, upgraded, and standardized training. He emphasized that his approach would make staff members better managers and leaders, while strengthening the organization.At the same time, he recognized that different branches served different populations, and often needed to take different approaches. He listened to staff and members.For example, Washington frequently attended meetings of teen coordinators from each of the branches, according to Joseph Gaeta, 31, the association-wide teen director, who is based at the East Boston branch.Gaeta came up with a plan to help keep teens in school. Boston schools offer a Web-based program that allows students to earn credits for courses they had failed. Gaeta told Washington that teens would be more to likely take advantage of the program if the Y provided an inviting space equipped with computers.Washington found a donor to foot the $25,000 bill for such a facility, which opened last winter in the East Boston branch. As a result, Gaeta said, East Boston High’s class of 2014 had 15 additional graduates.“It was never him telling us what to do,” Gaeta said. “It was always us discussing what to do.”* * *Washington said his experiences in Boston, dealing with different populations, interests, and priorities among branches will help in his new job overseeing a federation of urban, suburban, and rural Ys.“I don’t think the missions are different,” he said. “We’re talking about strengthening the fabric of community. People in Wisconsin have health issues too, they have youth development issues. Young people, regardless of where they grow up, are at risk.”Washington said he first hesitated to pursue national Y’s top job, even sending his resume a few days past the deadline. “Leaving was tough because we’re on a roll,” he said in an interview at his office in the Huntington Avenue building.Hanging on his wall is a picture that looks like a movie poster of Yul Brynner and the other stars of the Western “The Magnificent Seven.” A closer look reveals seven African-American faces, that of Washington among them. In 2004, when time the graphic was made, they were the only black CEOs among the nation’s 70 largest Y associations.Washington said the count is now up to 10. He sees his appointment to lead the national organization as an example of the Y’s commitment to diversity. More needs to be done, he said. But, he stressed, the movement has long opened its doors to people of all colors, incomes, and heritage.Washington looks back to that shy, wiry boy trying to grow up on the streets of South Philadelphia a half century ago.“I tell everyone the YMCA found me at the age of 10 at the William S. Pierce elementary school,” he said. “The Y can be a bridge from adolescence to adulthood. It was for me.”""",

The emphasis on data came from the new generation of municipal officials educated at Harvard and MIT: Walsh’s chief of staff, Daniel Arrigg Koh, and Boston’s chief information officer, Jascha Franklin-Hodge. The third was Michael Goldman, an outside communications consultant whose political roots date to the 1970s and the first administration of former governor Michael S. Dukakis.Under Menino, the city used data in an effort called “Boston About Results.” The initiative tracked more than 200 performance metrics that included everything from employee overtime to library card usage, the number of trees planted to violent crime. The data were regularly analyzed by top city officials and reports were made public every three months.Walsh’s goal is to change the culture at City Hall by infusing all levels of government with a data-driven approach, according to Koh. One Cabinet meeting a month will be dedicated to reviewing the data, and top officials will be required to submit reports to show progress toward each of Walsh’s goals. The mayor said the data would be made public.“The idea of people really thinking at all levels of government about how we measure things quantitatively is novel,” Koh said. “But I think people are really excited about it.”As an example, he pointed to Melissa Pagan, supervisor of veterans’ services. Pagan’s department hears from veterans across the city and employees track calls by neighborhood.“I input all the information and it goes zooming up to the mayor’s office to his big screen,” Pagan said.Focusing on collecting and analyzing data is part of the new administrations effort to manage a city workforce with more than 18,000 employees and 20 different departments.“If we built this correctly, the measures that we are talking about translate into real impact for people of this city. That is the goal,” said Franklin-Hodge, the chief information officer.For the mayor, the push to drive his agenda with data is an attempt to show tangible progress on the array of complex problems facing Boston.“I want to be able to look back three years from now and say, ‘OK this is what we spoke about when we first came into office. And this is where we are today,’\u2009’’ Walsh said. “The biggest piece is really for me personally .\xa0.\xa0. going from a legislator to an executive. That transformation took almost a year in.”\n""",

6446,Thomas M. Menino,"""""",
6447,Thomas M. Menino,"""It comes as something of a shock to have Aasif Mandvi describe himself as an actor on “The Daily Show.’’ He has become so well-known as\n\n the late-night program’s “senior Middle East-Muslim-All Things Brown correspondent’’ that it’s easy to forget that the show is satire and that “guest correspondents” like Mandvi are, well, actors.Mandvi’s book “No Land’s Man’’ is a collection of humorous essays that explore his myriad identities: Indian, Muslim, British, and American. But you get the feeling that the identity Mandvi, 48, would most claim for himself is that of actor. Having seen Mandvi in his charming, daffy, but surprisingly affecting 2009 movie, “Today’s Special’’ (which he also co-wrote), it is easy to understand why. \n\n\t\nMandvi is \nconcerned here with exploring how the world has pegged him, how it sees him. The book is a lighthearted but heartfelt portrait of Mandvi’s childhood and his struggles to come to terms with his rather complicated life. Born in India and raised in England, Mandvi emigrates to the United States as a teenager, thanks to the whims of his father, who decides that any country that has invented the concept of brunch is worth living in. The young Mandvi is happy to get away from cold, gloomy England, where the kids at his boarding school refer to him as “Curry Pot’’ and chant, “Let’s go Paki bashing.” \nAnything-goes America treats the teenager better than formal England had. Almost immediately Mandvi falls in with “the wrong crowd: the Actors.” It is his first, and lasting, chosen identity. Acting is such an odd career choice for an Indian-American boy in the early 1980s that the only thing his bewildered relatives can advise is that he model himself after Omar Sharif, the only brown-skinned Hollywood actor they know.Two years into his life in America, Mandvi brings the crowd at his high school variety show to its feet by performing Michael Jackson’s “Billie Jean,” silver glove and all. His transformation is complete: “I was an Indian, English kid who had been transplanted to America, dancing on a Tampa high school stage, channeling a black man who looked like an Indian girl.” \nMandvi, by the way, references this and other aspects of the book in a witty, goofy Internet  book trailer. \nIn it, Mandvi approaches several actor friends to star in the trailer, only to be turned down.\nThere is his brush with an overly solicitous Jack Black, who, when he finds out Mandvi is Muslim, insists that the irreligious Mandvi pray on the spot. There is a scene with Connie Britton, who has known Mandvi for 20 years, but who dismisses him with, “So you’re Indian now?” Finally, there is the encounter with John Oliver who, like a propah British colonialist, renames the book “Oliver’s Land’s Man.’The shadow of 9/11, and the backlash against Islam, hovers over these \nessays, coloring Mandvi’s uneasy relationship with his religion. Mandvi also writes about his struggle as an actor to get roles other than stereotypically ethnic ones. \n\nPerhaps the most poignant chapter of the book is his encounter on a train with a beautiful Pakistani woman during a visit back to England. Mandvi is drawn to the stranger’s beauty but repelled by the hijab that covers her from head to toe. Despite their superficial similarities — both of them Muslim, both raised in England — he senses the unbridgeable gulf between her piety and his ambivalent relationship with Islam. \nFor every serious moment, though, there are plenty of lighter ones. I enjoyed reading about Mandvi’s father, who not only impulsively moves the family to Florida, but also makes them all wear IHOP (“International House of Patel’’) T-shirts while on vacation in the hope of getting discounts at the restaurant chain. There is also an amusing chapter on Mandvi’s interaction with the eccentric director Ismail Merchant, who at a party accuses the hapless Mandvi of “having sex on my chair and he broke it.” (Don’t ask.) \nThe irony of Mandvi becoming the Middle East-Muslim-All Things Brown correspondent on “The Daily Show’’ is not lost on him. But neither is the pride that other Muslim-Americans feel in his success and visibility.As Mandvi acknowledges, that pride is misplaced. He is, after all, merely an actor, the Muslim correspondent who doesn’t know much about the religion he professes to represent on TV. But perhaps Mandvi is wrong about this; at a time when racial sensitivities are so high, maybe the sheer presence of a brown-skinned Muslim correspondent on TV matters. Even if he’s a fake correspondent on a fake news show.Or, as Jon Stewart once told Mandvi when he protested that he couldn’t speak for all of Islam: “I know .\xa0.\xa0. but right now .\xa0.\xa0. you’re all we’ve got.” """,

He and his band return for a more intimate show at the Orpheum, which bodes well for the sound quality. This tour coincides with the recent release of “The Basement Tapes Complete,” along with word of a new album coming next year. \n\n\t\n\n\n His new self-titled album plumbs his favorite topic: Where did it all go wrong? But man, it sure feels right as Adams dims the lights and turns up the country-tinged heartache. \n\n He’s been many things in 40-plus years, from writer of bracing pop songs loaded with social commentary to composer of numerous film scores. Ahead of a new album he expects to release next year, Newman will cherry-pick from his long career, which means you’re likely to hear “Sail Away”  “You’ve Got a Friend in Me” (from “Toy Story”). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n The most amazing thing about this Oklahoma singer-songwriter might not be his Saturday night and Sunday morning stories and sounds, but the fact that they’re coming from a man who’s barely 20 years old. Strike while the iron is hot; he won’t be playing rooms this size for long. \n\nPerhaps you’re not yet in the mood, but the department stores have had their Christmas stuff on the floor for weeks and the seasonal musical offerings are starting to roll out. This year’s prize for first one out of the gate goes to the tall man with the low-down voice, who’s doing two area shows. \n\nGiulia Millanta was born and raised in Florence, Italy, and now lives in Austin, Texas, a bicontinentalism reflected in her latest record, “The Funambulist,” or tightrope walker — one who, says Millanta, connects two places that are far away. From a lot closer, Susan Cattaneo has turned toward a capacious Americana that encompasses country, blues, and folk. \n\nRobinson engages in musical genealogy with her project “The Rose of No Man’s Land,” which tells the story of ancestors who have been involved in every major American war since the country’s birth via songs from the Revolutionary War forward and stories, letters, and poetry from her Alabama family. Ramblin’ Jack Elliot will be on hand to help her out, and Tom Rush will serve as narrator. \n\n\n\n\nThis tribute to the late, great trumpet virtuoso and bebop fountainhead is authorized by his widow, Lorraine Gillespie, and led by his long-time bassist, John Lee. Featuring powerhouse trumpeter Freddy Hendrix, alto saxophonist Mark Gross, pianist Jeb Patton, guitarist Dave Stryker, and drummer Tommy Campbell. \n\n\nVocalist Larkin and trumpeter Stout, husband and wife, pay tribute to their recently departed friend Lenny Sogoloff, owner of the lamented Lennys on the Turnpike jazz club, which featured the legendary likes of Miles Davis, Buddy Rich, and Phil Woods. The couple will perform selections from the Great American Songbook, accompanied by pianist Tim Ray, ubiquitous bassist John Lockwood, and Boston Pops percussionist Jim Gwin on drums. \n\nThe beloved vocalist, composer, and educator, a specialist in many shades of African-American song, highlights the blue side of things for this rare area appearance. \n\nSix of the fieriest musicians around turn up the heat on free jazz originals. Featuring drummer Mike Conner, pianist Pandelis Karayorgis, baritone saxophonist Charlie Kohlhase, bass clarinetist Todd Brunel, guitarist Jeff Platz, and bassist Kit Demos. \n\n\n\n\nAndris Nelsons conducts Stravinsky’s “Rite of Spring” and Tchaikovsky’s “Hamlet,” as well as the American premiere of Brett Dean’s trumpet concerto “Dramatis Personae,” with soloist Hakan Hardenberger. \n\nUnder its forward-thinking music director Michael Tilson Thomas, the San Francisco Symphony returns to town for the first time in a decade. On the program will be works by Liszt, Ravel, Prokofiev, and Samuel Carl Adams. The ubiquitous Gil Shaham joins as violin soloist. \n\nMartin Pearlman leads off Boston Baroque’s 40th-anniversary season with one of the cornerstones of its repertoire, Monteverdi’s 1610 Vespers, with Yulia Van Doren, Teresa Wakim, Thomas Cooley, and Aaron Sheehan as vocal soloists (Nov. 14-15, 8 p.m., Jordan Hall). And the singers of Blue Heron team up with Harvard’s Thomas Forrest Kelly for a two-part demonstration event linked to the publication of Kelly’s new book, “Capturing Music: The Story of Notation” (Nov 15, 3 and 8 p.m., First Church in Cambridge). \n\nBrandeis University picks up the baton for the centennial celebrations of the distinguished American composer. A symposium Saturday afternoon will feature remarks from Ramon Gilbert, Richard Wernick, and Yehudi Wyner (moderated by Eric Chasalow). And Saturday evening, Music from Copland House offers an all-Fine program. \n\n\n""",

6536,Johnson,"""Black and Latino males are facing an educational crisis in Boston, lagging substantially behind their peers on the MCAS, high school graduation rates, and other barometers that lower their prospects for college or workforce success, according to a city-commissioned report being released Thursday.Collectively, the data paint troubling gaps in achievement that persist more than 40 years after court-ordered desegregation of the city’s school system.\n\t\nThe report also raises questions among researchers about whether the School Department has unintentionally created a two-track system — one that provides white and Asian males with the greatest learning opportunities while black and Latino males are left with woefully diminished access.For instance, just 8.6 percent of black males and 8 percent of Latino males in the city’s school system were enrolled in its highly regarded exam schools in 2012, compared with 45 percent of white males and 47.8 percent of Asian males.On the other end of the spectrum, the report said, black and Latino males were far more likely to be enrolled in special education classrooms, where instruction is considered inferior to that in regular classrooms.Rahn Dorsey, the city’s education chief, called the report “profoundly important,” noting that two-thirds of Boston’s male residents age 19 or younger are black or Latino.“That is the greater preponderance of young men in the city we have to invest in to make sure Boston is thriving and competitive moving forward,” Dorsey said.“We really want to know what they are up against and what is working for them so we can better understand the investments we need to make in their lives.”The report, set to be released during \nan event at City Year Boston, is believed to be the most comprehensive analysis in recent memory of the performance of black and Latino males in Boston schools on an array of academic measures.Typically, achievement by the two groups is highlighted within isolated performance measures, such as the annual release of MCAS results in the fall or in high-school graduation rates released each winter.The report, which examined data between 2009 and 2012, was prepared by the Center for Collaborative Education, a nonprofit in Boston, and the Annenberg Institute for School Reform at Brown University. Former Boston school superintendent Carol R. Johnson ordered the report.Among some of the findings:\n\xa0Just 22.1 percent of black males and 24.9 percent of Latino males scored proficient or higher on the English MCAS exams in elementary school, compared with 56.9 percent for white males and 48.5 percent for Asian males.\n\xa0 66.9 percent of black males and 60.4 percent of Latino males graduated within four years, compared with 81.5 percent of white males and 90.5 percent of Asian males.The data reflect a national trend of low achievement among black and Latino males, prompting President Obama earlier this year to launch an educational initiative, “My Brother’s Keeper,” which aims to develop strategies to help the two groups do better in school and throughout their lives.But the problem is particularly critical in Boston because Massachusetts’ economy relies more on highly skilled workers than most other states, according to the report.The School Department’s failure to help many black and Latino males acquire the necessary job training could make it more difficult for them to gain long-term employment and lead to unhealthy decisions that could be a drain on the city’s vitality, it states.\nJohnny McInnis, president of the Black Educators Alliance of Massachusetts who teaches in Boston, said he feels the school system is making incremental progress in addressing the achievement gap, but has been hamstrung by budget cuts and the lack of broader solutions.“We are losing people we need who specialize in supporting these students,” he said.The report does not offer concrete explanations for the lagging achievement of black and Latino males. Dan French, executive director of the Center for Collaborative Education, said it is an area for deeper examination.Another  by the local Black and Latino Collaborative explored the plight of black and Latino males on a number of indicators that affect their well-being beyond the school doors.That report noted, for instance, that nearly half of those two populations age 19 or younger were on public assistance — twice the rate as whites and Asians.Ayomide Olumuyiwa, a student representative on the Boston School Committee, said he was unaware that black and Latino males were lagging until it was mentioned at a recent committee meeting.“It’s just alarming,” said Olumuyiwa, a senior at the O’Bryant School of Math and Science, an exam school in Roxbury. “This is something students wouldn’t find out on their own unless they asked.”Olumuyiwa self identifies as a first-generation African-American whose parents are from Nigeria. He started off his education in Randolph and then moved to Boston in the seventh grade. He said he recalls that his first math class in Boston covered the same material he had in the fifth grade in Randolph.“I thought they made a mistake,” Olumuyiwa said.The latest report offers wide-ranging recommendations, including some that would likely stoke opposition.For instance, it recommends converting every classroom in grades 4 to 6 into advanced-work programs. The program, a gateway into the exam schools, enrolls few black and Latino males. But the recommendation would probably stir debate about whether all students are ready for that rigor or whether advanced work would be watered down.Other recommendations endorse efforts already underway, such as expanding early childhood education and the diversity of the teaching force, and stepping up efforts to train teachers on any unintentional biases against others of different races. That latter area could address why black and Latino males are disciplined or suspended at higher rates.“Youth understand fairness far better than adults,” said Matt Cregor, staff lawyer with the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights and Economic Justice.“When students don’t feel like they are being treated fairly or disciplined fairly they become disengaged and they could drop out,’ he said. “We can’t risk disengaging youth this way if we want them to succeed.”""",

Scigliano IV, 45, of Kingston, in two schemes he allegedly carried out between 2008 and 2011, when he was a drillmaster in charge of the Boston Fire Academy on Moon Island in Boston Harbor, authorities said.\n\t\nScigliano, who had been on paid administrative leave since July 2012, is not in custody. A home telephone number listed for him was not in service Thursday. Officials could not say who is representing him.In a statement, Fire Commissioner Joseph E. Finn said that Scigliano’s status was changed to unpaid leave after the indictment was announced. Scigliano’s arraignment on five counts each of procurement fraud and larceny over $250 is scheduled for Nov. 25, the office of Attorney General Martha Coakley said.Under one scheme, Scigliano allegedly directed Greenwood Emergency Vehicles Inc., a North Attleborough-based company that supplied trucks to the Fire Department, to issue checks totaling $32,000, which were owed to the city, toward his personal credit card expenses, prosecutors said. Scigliano was the department’s principal contact with Greenwood.Those funds included balances that were due to the city after order specifications changed for trucks, according to authorities. Scigliano allegedly “falsely represented” to Greenwood that then-fire Commissioner Roderick Fraser authorized him to receive the checks, Coakleys office said.  Greenwood’s president, Tim O’Neill, said in a statement that his company has cooperated with investigators for the past two years, and will continue to do so. He said Scigliano was his point of contact with the department since 2007.“It is distressing that the checks listed in the indictment were not used to purchase equipment for the Boston Fire Department as we were told but allegedly used for District Chief Scigliano’s personal gain,’’ O’Neill said in a statement. “We cooperated fully and continue to do so to see that justice is served.” In the second plot, Scigliano allegedly altered purchase orders with Northeast Rescue Systems Inc., a Roslindale company that supplied training equipment to the Fire Department, according to Coakley’s office. The initial purchase orders from the city were for equipment for the academy. However, Scigliano allegedly changed the orders so that Northeast billed the city more than $14,000 for  items that he used for himself, including a 52-inch HD TV, gas grill, living room set, elliptical machine, and gift cards for Home Depot and Lowe’s, according to prosecutors.Brian T. Kelly, a lawyer for Northeast, said the company thought the items were to be used at the training academy and was “victimized in this case.”He said Northeast is cooperating with authorities. Scigliano was paid $164,846 in 2013 while out on leave, records show. “These allegations of misconduct are disappointing to say the least,” said Finn, the fire commissioner. “I have zero tolerance for anyone who betrays the oath of office of a firefighter and pledge to take swift, decisive action if warranted, at the resolution of this case,” the commissioner said. Kate Norton, a spokeswoman for Mayor Martin J. Walsh, said in a statement that the mayor’s office is cooperating with investigators. “This is now in the hands of the courts, and we will continue to cooperate however needed,” Norton said. Richard Paris, president of the firefighters’ union, declined to comment, since the case is pending. If convicted, Scigliano faces a maximum prison term of five years on each count. """,

6723,Chambers,"""Two years ago, Roxbury Community College was mired in controversy. Whistle-blower complaints prompted a federal investigation into troubling lapses in reporting campus crimes, while the state auditor’s office launched a review of financial mismanagement at the colleges athletic center.The financial aid program was in such disarray the US government refused to distribute funds directly, forcing the school to cover grants, then seek federal reimbursements. Under siege on multiple fronts, the college seemed to be coming apart at the seams.\n\t\n\nBut president Valerie Roberson, who arrived last summer, has led an aggressive turnaround plan, paring a budget that was millions in deficit, cutting administrative staff by about 20 percent, and taking a hard look at the entire academic operation.Roberson has begun to reach out to area high schools in hopes of boosting enrollment. She is also seeking to strengthen relationships with area colleges, hospitals, and businesses to help students land internships and jobs.\n\nRoberson said she took the job with the understanding that the school had plenty of problems. But over the past year, the full extent of its troubles became clear, she said.“It was just the tip of the iceberg,” she said in an interview. “You find out the challenges are much more systemic, and we had to start at the foundation.”Gerald Chertavian, chairman of the college’s board of trustees who was appointed by Governor Deval Patrick last year, likened Roberson’s first year to a kind of triage, given the host of immediate problems the college faced.Despite the sweeping overhaul, Chertavian and Roberson agree the college, long plagued by poor management and low graduation rates, has substantial work ahead. It remains under federal investigation for violating campus safety laws, while its financial aid program remains under watch. And rebuilding the college’s reputation will take time.Roxbury Community College is among the state’s smallest, and enrollment has dropped by more than 300 students since 2011. But in the past year, it climbed 3 percent, a welcome sign of progress.The college has also made strides in resolving the crises that roiled the campus two years ago, gradually regaining the trust of federal monitors. “We’re a few innings into a longer game,” Chertavian said. “And we need to hold ourselves accountable.”The stakes are high, education officials say. Community colleges are vital training grounds for so-called middle-skilled jobs, a growing segment of the employment market that often requires associate’s degrees, and as springboards to four-year colleges for students from low-income backgrounds.At Roxbury Community College, where the average student is 29 and is usually balancing classes with work and family responsibilities, classes can provide a path to a better-paying job or a career change.Yet skepticism about the college has sent many students, even those who live nearby, to other schools, particularly Bunker Hill Community College. In response, RCC is trying to improve student services — making it simpler for students to find the right classes and receive financial aid — and reaching out to area high schools to rebuild a sense of trust.“The college has to have a stronger relationship with college counselors and principals,” Roberson said.The college has begun distributing an informational magazine called “Career Focus,” which highlights specific academic programs and their potential jobs. For example, a feature on the nursing program notes that licensed nurses earn more than $50,000 a year, while nursing assistants earn close to $30,000.\nRichard Freeland, the state’s commissioner of higher education, said Roberson moved quickly to address the repeated shortcomings that had drawn state and federal scrutiny, and made sweeping changes to the staff. “She cleaned house,” Freeland said. “I’ve never seen a broader set of personnel changes.”A longtime community college administrator, Roberson came to Boston from Joliet Junior College in Joliet, Ill., where she was vice president for academic affairs. She was formerly president of Olive-Harvey College, a community college in Chicago.Upon arriving, her most immediate problem was the financial aid department, which had come under scrutiny for violating federal policies.“The federal government had totally lost confidence in their ability to manage this money responsibly,” Freeland said. “There were problems almost across the board.”To remedy the problem, RCC now offers a support system that can guide students through the tricky process of applying for financial aid. The college retrained financial aid staff on the latest federal regulations, and has been in daily contact with the US Department of Education.While the college must still handle some costs up front, the speed of reimbursements has accelerated, she said.“We’re making significant progress,” she said. “They are gaining confidence.”The college was also facing a substantial deficit, with little money left in reserve. In the spring, the Legislature authorized $3 million to shore up the school’s finances.Roberson said the college was not spending efficiently and she tried to cut costs without hurting academics.The college’s administration is aggressively seeking more grants, and is working to bolster fund-raising, she said. Chertavian said financial stability is crucial to the college’s success.“This college both deserves and needs resources,” he said.The newfound sense of progress stands in stark contrast to recent years, when the college faced a series of controversies that led to president Terrence Gomes stepping down in June 2012.\nThe state auditor’s office found a range of financial lapses at the college’s Reggie Lewis Track and Athletic Center, and Roberson found the facility had been run with little oversight from the college. Under a new chief financial officer, the center has been brought into the fold, she said.RCC had also come under investigation for failing to investigate and report sexual crimes on campus, including allegations against two employees.In March 2013, the college released a report that found that senior administrators had not properly reported allegations of sexual assault and in one case had apparently paid a student to keep quiet.\nNow, all mandatory reporters have received training on the proper procedures for handling allegations of sexual assaults and reporting them as required under federal law.\n“We’re in full compliance,” she said.\nIn its most recent information required under the Clery Act, RCC said it had received no reports of sexual offenses on campus in 2013. As a commuter school with a small campus, the college will typically have fewer reports of crimes than a residential campus, Roberson said.\nStudents and recent graduates say they largely felt removed from the controversy swirling around the school, and that they didn’t believe it affected the quality of the classes. Kevin Small Jr., 20, who graduated in the spring with a degree in business administration, said his overall experience at the school was extremely positive.Small grew up in Dorchester and chose Roxbury Community College to help him adjust to college academics. He initially thought he would take just a few classes before transferring to a four-year school, but wound up staying the full two years.“I didn’t want to leave because the experience was so strong,” he said.Now a student at Suffolk University, Small said his time at RCC prepared him well.Roberson said that while handling immediate problems has consumed much of her time, it gave her greater insight into the colleges inner workings.“It’s been a tough year,” she said. “But in a strange way, it helped. It forced me to get into the weeds.”""",

Both men were pronounced dead where they were found, he said.One body was discovered at the Uphams Corner commuter rail station in Dorchester around 8:15 p.m. Sunday. The second body was discovered in a bathroom stall at the South Station commuter rail station around 12:30 a.m. Tuesday.Sullivan said that in both instances, police believe the victims obtained drugs from dealers operating near the stations and then went to the stations to use what became the fatal doses.“We’ve had an increase of drug-related activity at the Uphams Corner commuter rail platform at night, not during heavy use times,’’ said Sullivan, citing the “drug evidence’’ left behind by drug users. He also said drug users appear to be able to find drug dealers in the Chinatown neighborhood before they make their way to South Station. He said the T is being affected by the same scourge of heroin abuse that has affected many communities.“It’s a serious issue across the Commonwealth,” Sullivan said.Sullivan said police were trying to track down the people who supplied the heroin to the two men.""",

7125,Elizabeth Warren,"""CAMBRIDGE — Trash blows through the playground at the Newtowne Court public housing development. A faint smell of sewage lingers in the air. Women sit at cement tables in a tree-lined courtyard, talking and laughing. Two men speak Creole through an open window.Just across Portland Street, it’s a different world. High-rises housing biotech companies and research labs rise above Kendall Square. The smell of garlicky pizza wafts from a glass-walled cafe; across a manicured lawn, a gas fireplace flickers in a restaurant offering a $61 four-course, prix fixe menu. \n\t\nThese worlds are unfolding side by side in this part of town, one with the kind of growth and opportunity that is the envy of the entire country, the other with a desperation that gets deeper by the day, and a name only an urban planner could love — Area Four. As global pharmaceutical companies build new labs, Internet giants Google and Twitter expand, and startups snap up office space at ever-higher rents, families living in the shadow of the innovation economy are flocking to the local food pantry at three times the rate of a decade ago. The waiting list for public housing is double what it was five years ago. The beds in the Salvation Army homeless shelter on Massachusetts Avenue are always full.\nPoor residents say the rush of new money and development has had one positive side-effect — the neighborhood is safer than it used to be. And business growth has flooded the city with tax dollars for social programs. But so far, this wave of prosperity has done little to lift up the low-income people living in its wake. And with every new shiny cube of glass and steel, the tension builds.“They’re enveloping us,” said Debra Morris, 56, a former legal secretary who lives in  Newtowne Court. “We’re talking billions of dollars right there. And right here you’ve got the lowest of the low.”\nMorris’s unemployment benefits ran out recently, and she gets by on temp jobs. Her 26-year-old son, who lives with her, is also out of work. It’s absurd that so much money pours into Kendall Square, Morris said, while next door parents struggle to feed their children.“When you look around us and you see what’s going on,” she said, “there’s no excuse for this.”  Area Four is literally on the wrong side of the tracks in Cambridge, occupying one-third of a square mile extending west from the train tracks in Kendall Square to Prospect Street in Central Square. Nearly 7,000 people, among them many of the poorest in the city, live here.The neighborhood reflects the disparities of Cambridge: Nearly a third of Area Four residents have graduate degrees, while just over a third of female-headed households live below the poverty line. Median family income is $59,384 a year, compared with $96,127 citywide. Area Four has the largest black population in the city, and more children than almost any other neighborhood. Perhaps nowhere is the contrast between haves and have-nots as stark as in Newtowne Court and Washington Elms, the squat World War II-era brick public housing developments across the street from the tall, sleek buildings that signal the entrance to Kendall Square.Mark Moses lives in Washington Elms with his two 20-something daughters. He takes classes  at Bunker Hill Community College and works full time at a nursing home in West Roxbury, bringing home $824 every two weeks. It’s not enough to get by.  One of his daughters is unemployed; the other works part time at a convenience store and helps with the bills.  After Moses pays his car loan — the vehicle was briefly repossessed when he fell behind — rent, insurance, and other expenses, there’s little left over for groceries, forcing him to rely on food pantries.As part of the Area 4 Coalition neighborhood association, Moses, 57, fought the expansion of the Swiss pharmaceutical company Novartis AG, which is constructing a half-million-square-foot campus for its global research headquarters nearby, citing increased traffic and the impact on housing costs. Like many people in the neighborhood, he believes the high-tech enclave would just as soon see “the projects” disappear. “They’re squeezing us out,” he said. The median price of a one-bedroom apartment in Cambridge is $2,200 a month, according to the online real estate company Zillow — more than many Area Four residents make in a month. A single-family home sells for a median price of  $1.1 million, up 70 percent from 2005, the peak of the last housing boom, according to the Warren Group, a Boston real estate tracking firm.\nLongtime resident Ernise Destin, 40, a Haitian immigrant,works as a housing search advocate for the homeless. In order to qualify for a subsidized rent voucher in Cambridge, a one-bedroom apartment can’t go for more than $1,256 a month, she said. In three months of searching for around 50 clients,  Destin found only one. \n A century ago, this corner of Cambridge was home to numerous factories, where unskilled laborers, many of them immigrants, made soap, rubber products, musical instruments, and candy, propelling themselves into the middle class. Today, even with more restaurants and retail shops in the area, there are far fewer employ-ment opportunities for people without a college education to earn a living wage. Marvarine Wilson, 57, was laid off three years ago from her job as a data clerk at Boston Children’s Hospital. She found part-time work as a crossing guard and gets by with a Section 8 housing voucher and monthly trips to a food pantry, where she also volunteers. In order to get another hospital job, Wilson needs to take a class on digital record-keeping, but she can’t afford it.The neighborhood’s name, or lack thereof, is symbolic of its long-neglected status. In 1953, the Planning Board divided the city into numbered sections. The area known as Cambridgeport was split in two, with the neighborhood south of Massachusetts Avenue retaining the name, while the section north of Mass. Ave., historically called the Port, was dubbed Area Four — one of the only neighborhoods not called by a unique name. Residents hate the name because it “sounds like a police designation, not a neighborhood,” said Sarah Boyer of the Cambridge Historical Commission. Housing isn’t the only thing that’s gotten more expensive as Kendall Square’s influence spreads. Johnnie’s Foodmaster, the low-cost grocery store in nearby Inman Square, is now a Whole Foods. Hi-Fi Pizza and it’s $2 slices are gone, soon to be replaced by a Clover Food Lab serving $6 chickpea fritter sandwiches. The dollar store is closed, too.Renae Gray, a longtime resident and community activist, said she sees women pushing baby carriages that she is fairly certain cost more than her $900-a-month mortgage. The bench she used to sit on when she strolled the neighborhood is gone, replaced by a Hubway bicycle station.  \n“I’m an old lady. I’m 63. I need to rest.” she said. “All of us are feeling alienated.” Meanwhile, the Salvation Army doubled the size of its homeless shelter and recovery program two years ago. The shelter can house 36 men a night, but over the course of a brutally cold month last winter, 250 more men slept in overflow cots and huddled in the cafeteria. The Salvation Army, which also is looking to expand its day care program for homeless children, said it gets donations from local restaurants, banks, real estate firms, and churches, but generally doesn’t pursue biotech firms because they tend to focus their giving on medical causes.Several have offered financial support, said director of operations Karen Meehan, as a group of men lined up for dinner behind her. As for the others: “They’d probably give us millions for the real estate, but we’re not going anywhere,” A few blocks away, at the Margaret Fuller Neighborhood House, children shrieked on the playground as parents waited for the cramped basement food pantry to open. When executive director Barbara Kibler  took over Margaret Fuller 11 years ago, the community center’s food pantry served about 400 people a month. Today, it’s about 1,200. On many days, the line stretches down Eaton Street. \nMark Pappas, 55, has lived in the Washington Elms and Newtowne Court developments his entire life. The unemployed drug addiction counselor and former heroin addict, in recovery for 23 years, has grown thin as he struggles with diabetes and high blood pressure. The clanging machinery and black soot coming in the windows from the constant Kendall Square expansion don’t help. “This ain’t living,” he said. “You feel like you’re in a box and theres all this stuff going up around you. They’ve got you trapped.”  \n\nThe high-tech and life science companies in Kendall Square are aware of the needs of the residents around them — and say they feel a responsibility to improve the neighborhood. Many have partnerships with local schools and neighborhood organizations, providing mentors and internships and after-school tutoring. Some go further.  Draper Laboratory, one of the first research facilities in the area, cofounded the Kendall Community Group in 1987 to provide services and volunteers for three nonprofits that support low-income Area Four families, including the Margaret Fuller House. Google partners with the jobs program Year Up to funnel low-income young adults into tech support jobs at Google, no college required.  Biogen Idec has a community lab connected to the schools and is funding a facility where at-risk teens can develop entrepreneurial skills. Novartis, a member of the Kendall Community Group, plans to create a lab open to students and teachers in its new building almost directly across from Newtowne Court.\n\n\n“There’s a whole group of kids that walk by these buildings every day and have no idea what’s going on inside,” said Jeff Lockwood, global head of communications for Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research. “We need to do everything we can to open these doors up to make the lightbulb go off so they can see their future right in their backyard.” \nStill, many families are hurting. Two-thirds of students at the local elementary school, Fletcher Maynard Academy, qualify for reduced-price lunches. Dozens are sent home on Fridays with backpacks full of sandwiches, soup, and fruit to help their families get through the weekend.  All the donations and good intentions in the world won’t send every low-income student in the neighborhood to college, or provide a support system for single mothers, acknowledged Paul Parravano, codirector of the office of government and community relations at MIT, which donates facilities for community fund-raisers and helps fund summer and after-school programs.“I think that the inequities that we’re talking about are strong societal ones,” he said. “These are very difficult to turn around.”\n\n Kendall Square businesses may feel committed to the community, but many don’t exert direct control over their most valuable potential resource for struggling residents: jobs. Like a lot of companies, biotechs often contract cleaning, food service, and other accessible jobs to outsourcing firms with little connection to the neighborhood, said Susan Mintz, adult employment director at the city’s Office of Workforce Development. Food and security contractors often bring on part-time workers at minimum wage; lower-level lab positions are increasingly filled by temporary workers.\nLow-income residents who complete a free, nine-month biomedical training program through the Cambridge nonprofit Just-A-Start Corp. earn around $35,000 a year, the majority working for staffing firms. But the class size depends on donors, and only a handful of local biotechs give to the program that feeds workers into their labs. \n“There are so many companies,” said program manager Jennifer O’Donnell. “It’s true there should be some giveback.”Cambridge City Councilor Dennis Benzan, who grew up in the Columbia Terrace housing development in Area Four, is trying to create more opportunities for people to climb the ladder to the middle class. His parents, who came here from the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico, worked their way out of the projects and into their own home with jobs at local factories — his mother making shoes, his father machining nuts and bolts.Earlier this year, Benzan, 42, started organizing local school and college administrators, nonprofits, and corporations to collaborate on a web portal to connect Cambridge students to after-school programs, mentorships, and apprenticeships related to technology and science. He also spurred the city to host a Kendall Square job fair in early October to introduce residents to the high-flying companies in their midst — and the skills needed to get jobs there. “It’s incredible to me that even in the parking lot, or in the cafeteria, or the concierge, I often go into these buildings for meetings, and I’ll ask, ‘Where are you from?’ They’re not from Cambridge,” said Benzan, who is in his first year on the council. “When a lot of these developers came before the council over the last decade for special zoning requests, the number- one question really should have been, how many construction jobs are you committing to people in the neighborhood? How many locals will be hired by companies that lease your building? And that’s where we missed the boat.”\n\nAnd yet this development is pumping money into the city. In the past five years, the city has received commitments for $12.8 million from developers requesting zoning changes, and many are required to pay into the city’s affordable-housing fund. Real estate taxes from a sample ofKendall Square businesses studied by the city increased 750 percent, to $23.2 million, between 1984 and 2012.  This money allows Cambridge to offer a more extensive array of programs than other cities, such as job skills training, parenting programs, and a team that connects underserved families with resources, said Brian Murphy, assistant city manager for community development. The city started a series of meetings with nonprofits earlier this year to assess community needs and help the city plan how to spend development money.\n\nStill, residents worry future growth is overshadowing current needs. Bill Cunningham and his wife moved into Newtowne Court in 1999 after getting evicted from a formerly rent-controlled apartment two days after his wife underwent cancer surgery. She died a few years later. Cunningham, a retired printing press operator and longtime advocate for low-income tenants, says the neighborhood needs affordable housing and grocery stores, not more biotechs and coffee shops.\n“The city’s plans are all for people who aren’t even here yet,” said Cunningham, 71. “Why don’t they plan for the people who are here now?” \n\n\n\n\n Median monthly rent of a one-bedroom apartment in Cambridge.\n Maximum monthly rent of a one-bedroom apartment in Cambridge for low-income tenants using a rental voucher.\n Real estate tax increase from a sample of Kendall Square businesses from 1984 to 2012.\n Amount the Margaret Fuller Neighborhood House got in donations this year from a handful of the 60 companies it solicited.\n""",

7309,Michael McCarthy,"""CAMBRIDGE — Trash blows through the playground at the Newtowne Court public housing development. A faint smell of sewage lingers in the air. Women sit at cement tables in a tree-lined courtyard, talking and laughing. Two men speak Creole through an open window.Just across Portland Street, it’s a different world. High-rises housing biotech companies and research labs rise above Kendall Square. The smell of garlicky pizza wafts from a glass-walled cafe; across a manicured lawn, a gas fireplace flickers in a restaurant offering a $61 four-course, prix fixe menu. \n\t\nThese worlds are unfolding side by side in this part of town, one with the kind of growth and opportunity that is the envy of the entire country, the other with a desperation that gets deeper by the day, and a name only an urban planner could love — Area Four. As global pharmaceutical companies build new labs, Internet giants Google and Twitter expand, and startups snap up office space at ever-higher rents, families living in the shadow of the innovation economy are flocking to the local food pantry at three times the rate of a decade ago. The waiting list for public housing is double what it was five years ago. The beds in the Salvation Army homeless shelter on Massachusetts Avenue are always full.\nPoor residents say the rush of new money and development has had one positive side-effect — the neighborhood is safer than it used to be. And business growth has flooded the city with tax dollars for social programs. But so far, this wave of prosperity has done little to lift up the low-income people living in its wake. And with every new shiny cube of glass and steel, the tension builds.“They’re enveloping us,” said Debra Morris, 56, a former legal secretary who lives in  Newtowne Court. “We’re talking billions of dollars right there. And right here you’ve got the lowest of the low.”\nMorris’s unemployment benefits ran out recently, and she gets by on temp jobs. Her 26-year-old son, who lives with her, is also out of work. It’s absurd that so much money pours into Kendall Square, Morris said, while next door parents struggle to feed their children.“When you look around us and you see what’s going on,” she said, “there’s no excuse for this.”  Area Four is literally on the wrong side of the tracks in Cambridge, occupying one-third of a square mile extending west from the train tracks in Kendall Square to Prospect Street in Central Square. Nearly 7,000 people, among them many of the poorest in the city, live here.The neighborhood reflects the disparities of Cambridge: Nearly a third of Area Four residents have graduate degrees, while just over a third of female-headed households live below the poverty line. Median family income is $59,384 a year, compared with $96,127 citywide. Area Four has the largest black population in the city, and more children than almost any other neighborhood. Perhaps nowhere is the contrast between haves and have-nots as stark as in Newtowne Court and Washington Elms, the squat World War II-era brick public housing developments across the street from the tall, sleek buildings that signal the entrance to Kendall Square.Mark Moses lives in Washington Elms with his two 20-something daughters. He takes classes  at Bunker Hill Community College and works full time at a nursing home in West Roxbury, bringing home $824 every two weeks. It’s not enough to get by.  One of his daughters is unemployed; the other works part time at a convenience store and helps with the bills.  After Moses pays his car loan — the vehicle was briefly repossessed when he fell behind — rent, insurance, and other expenses, there’s little left over for groceries, forcing him to rely on food pantries.As part of the Area 4 Coalition neighborhood association, Moses, 57, fought the expansion of the Swiss pharmaceutical company Novartis AG, which is constructing a half-million-square-foot campus for its global research headquarters nearby, citing increased traffic and the impact on housing costs. Like many people in the neighborhood, he believes the high-tech enclave would just as soon see “the projects” disappear. “They’re squeezing us out,” he said. The median price of a one-bedroom apartment in Cambridge is $2,200 a month, according to the online real estate company Zillow — more than many Area Four residents make in a month. A single-family home sells for a median price of  $1.1 million, up 70 percent from 2005, the peak of the last housing boom, according to the Warren Group, a Boston real estate tracking firm.\nLongtime resident Ernise Destin, 40, a Haitian immigrant,works as a housing search advocate for the homeless. In order to qualify for a subsidized rent voucher in Cambridge, a one-bedroom apartment can’t go for more than $1,256 a month, she said. In three months of searching for around 50 clients,  Destin found only one. \n A century ago, this corner of Cambridge was home to numerous factories, where unskilled laborers, many of them immigrants, made soap, rubber products, musical instruments, and candy, propelling themselves into the middle class. Today, even with more restaurants and retail shops in the area, there are far fewer employ-ment opportunities for people without a college education to earn a living wage. Marvarine Wilson, 57, was laid off three years ago from her job as a data clerk at Boston Children’s Hospital. She found part-time work as a crossing guard and gets by with a Section 8 housing voucher and monthly trips to a food pantry, where she also volunteers. In order to get another hospital job, Wilson needs to take a class on digital record-keeping, but she can’t afford it.The neighborhood’s name, or lack thereof, is symbolic of its long-neglected status. In 1953, the Planning Board divided the city into numbered sections. The area known as Cambridgeport was split in two, with the neighborhood south of Massachusetts Avenue retaining the name, while the section north of Mass. Ave., historically called the Port, was dubbed Area Four — one of the only neighborhoods not called by a unique name. Residents hate the name because it “sounds like a police designation, not a neighborhood,” said Sarah Boyer of the Cambridge Historical Commission. Housing isn’t the only thing that’s gotten more expensive as Kendall Square’s influence spreads. Johnnie’s Foodmaster, the low-cost grocery store in nearby Inman Square, is now a Whole Foods. Hi-Fi Pizza and it’s $2 slices are gone, soon to be replaced by a Clover Food Lab serving $6 chickpea fritter sandwiches. The dollar store is closed, too.Renae Gray, a longtime resident and community activist, said she sees women pushing baby carriages that she is fairly certain cost more than her $900-a-month mortgage. The bench she used to sit on when she strolled the neighborhood is gone, replaced by a Hubway bicycle station.  \n“I’m an old lady. I’m 63. I need to rest.” she said. “All of us are feeling alienated.” Meanwhile, the Salvation Army doubled the size of its homeless shelter and recovery program two years ago. The shelter can house 36 men a night, but over the course of a brutally cold month last winter, 250 more men slept in overflow cots and huddled in the cafeteria. The Salvation Army, which also is looking to expand its day care program for homeless children, said it gets donations from local restaurants, banks, real estate firms, and churches, but generally doesn’t pursue biotech firms because they tend to focus their giving on medical causes.Several have offered financial support, said director of operations Karen Meehan, as a group of men lined up for dinner behind her. As for the others: “They’d probably give us millions for the real estate, but we’re not going anywhere,” A few blocks away, at the Margaret Fuller Neighborhood House, children shrieked on the playground as parents waited for the cramped basement food pantry to open. When executive director Barbara Kibler  took over Margaret Fuller 11 years ago, the community center’s food pantry served about 400 people a month. Today, it’s about 1,200. On many days, the line stretches down Eaton Street. \nMark Pappas, 55, has lived in the Washington Elms and Newtowne Court developments his entire life. The unemployed drug addiction counselor and former heroin addict, in recovery for 23 years, has grown thin as he struggles with diabetes and high blood pressure. The clanging machinery and black soot coming in the windows from the constant Kendall Square expansion don’t help. “This ain’t living,” he said. “You feel like you’re in a box and theres all this stuff going up around you. They’ve got you trapped.”  \n\nThe high-tech and life science companies in Kendall Square are aware of the needs of the residents around them — and say they feel a responsibility to improve the neighborhood. Many have partnerships with local schools and neighborhood organizations, providing mentors and internships and after-school tutoring. Some go further.  Draper Laboratory, one of the first research facilities in the area, cofounded the Kendall Community Group in 1987 to provide services and volunteers for three nonprofits that support low-income Area Four families, including the Margaret Fuller House. Google partners with the jobs program Year Up to funnel low-income young adults into tech support jobs at Google, no college required.  Biogen Idec has a community lab connected to the schools and is funding a facility where at-risk teens can develop entrepreneurial skills. Novartis, a member of the Kendall Community Group, plans to create a lab open to students and teachers in its new building almost directly across from Newtowne Court.\n\n\n“There’s a whole group of kids that walk by these buildings every day and have no idea what’s going on inside,” said Jeff Lockwood, global head of communications for Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research. “We need to do everything we can to open these doors up to make the lightbulb go off so they can see their future right in their backyard.” \nStill, many families are hurting. Two-thirds of students at the local elementary school, Fletcher Maynard Academy, qualify for reduced-price lunches. Dozens are sent home on Fridays with backpacks full of sandwiches, soup, and fruit to help their families get through the weekend.  All the donations and good intentions in the world won’t send every low-income student in the neighborhood to college, or provide a support system for single mothers, acknowledged Paul Parravano, codirector of the office of government and community relations at MIT, which donates facilities for community fund-raisers and helps fund summer and after-school programs.“I think that the inequities that we’re talking about are strong societal ones,” he said. “These are very difficult to turn around.”\n\n Kendall Square businesses may feel committed to the community, but many don’t exert direct control over their most valuable potential resource for struggling residents: jobs. Like a lot of companies, biotechs often contract cleaning, food service, and other accessible jobs to outsourcing firms with little connection to the neighborhood, said Susan Mintz, adult employment director at the city’s Office of Workforce Development. Food and security contractors often bring on part-time workers at minimum wage; lower-level lab positions are increasingly filled by temporary workers.\nLow-income residents who complete a free, nine-month biomedical training program through the Cambridge nonprofit Just-A-Start Corp. earn around $35,000 a year, the majority working for staffing firms. But the class size depends on donors, and only a handful of local biotechs give to the program that feeds workers into their labs. \n“There are so many companies,” said program manager Jennifer O’Donnell. “It’s true there should be some giveback.”Cambridge City Councilor Dennis Benzan, who grew up in the Columbia Terrace housing development in Area Four, is trying to create more opportunities for people to climb the ladder to the middle class. His parents, who came here from the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico, worked their way out of the projects and into their own home with jobs at local factories — his mother making shoes, his father machining nuts and bolts.Earlier this year, Benzan, 42, started organizing local school and college administrators, nonprofits, and corporations to collaborate on a web portal to connect Cambridge students to after-school programs, mentorships, and apprenticeships related to technology and science. He also spurred the city to host a Kendall Square job fair in early October to introduce residents to the high-flying companies in their midst — and the skills needed to get jobs there. “It’s incredible to me that even in the parking lot, or in the cafeteria, or the concierge, I often go into these buildings for meetings, and I’ll ask, ‘Where are you from?’ They’re not from Cambridge,” said Benzan, who is in his first year on the council. “When a lot of these developers came before the council over the last decade for special zoning requests, the number- one question really should have been, how many construction jobs are you committing to people in the neighborhood? How many locals will be hired by companies that lease your building? And that’s where we missed the boat.”\n\nAnd yet this development is pumping money into the city. In the past five years, the city has received commitments for $12.8 million from developers requesting zoning changes, and many are required to pay into the city’s affordable-housing fund. Real estate taxes from a sample ofKendall Square businesses studied by the city increased 750 percent, to $23.2 million, between 1984 and 2012.  This money allows Cambridge to offer a more extensive array of programs than other cities, such as job skills training, parenting programs, and a team that connects underserved families with resources, said Brian Murphy, assistant city manager for community development. The city started a series of meetings with nonprofits earlier this year to assess community needs and help the city plan how to spend development money.\n\nStill, residents worry future growth is overshadowing current needs. Bill Cunningham and his wife moved into Newtowne Court in 1999 after getting evicted from a formerly rent-controlled apartment two days after his wife underwent cancer surgery. She died a few years later. Cunningham, a retired printing press operator and longtime advocate for low-income tenants, says the neighborhood needs affordable housing and grocery stores, not more biotechs and coffee shops.\n“The city’s plans are all for people who aren’t even here yet,” said Cunningham, 71. “Why don’t they plan for the people who are here now?” \n\n\n\n\n Median monthly rent of a one-bedroom apartment in Cambridge.\n Maximum monthly rent of a one-bedroom apartment in Cambridge for low-income tenants using a rental voucher.\n Real estate tax increase from a sample of Kendall Square businesses from 1984 to 2012.\n Amount the Margaret Fuller Neighborhood House got in donations this year from a handful of the 60 companies it solicited.\n""",

The allegations of physical neglect were never substantiated, but they led to the criminal case over Astor’s finances.Astor was 105 and suffering from Alzheimer’s disease when she died in 2007. Years earlier, she was awarded the nation’s highest civilian honor — the Presidential Medal of Freedom — for giving away nearly $200 million to charities and institutions.Prosecutors said Marshall helped himself to his mother’s fortune by means as simple as taking artwork off her walls and as complex as getting her to change her will to give him millions of dollars formerly destined for charity. Witnesses included Walters, Kissinger and other prominent Astor friends.Marshall’s lawyers said he had the legal power to give himself gifts with his mother’s money, and he believed she wanted him to have them. Defense lawyers also argued that Astor was lucid and acting out of love when she altered her will to benefit her only child.Jurors disagreed and found Marshall guilty of grand larceny and scheming to defraud.Marshall didn’t testify or call any witnesses. But after his conviction, he bared his personal life and enlisted such prominent supporters as Al Roker and Whoopi Goldberg in an effort to stay free.He described in court papers an often sad, if privileged, upbringing. He painted his father — Astor’s first husband, New Jersey state Sen. J. Dryden Kuser — as an alcoholic who pushed the pregnant Astor down a flight of stairs.After they divorced, Astor married stockbroker Charles Marshall, who virtually banished her son to boarding schools and summer camps, Anthony Marshall said. He took his stepfather’s name nonetheless.After Charles Marshall died, she married Vincent Astor, a scion of one of the country’s first ultrarich families.Meanwhile, Anthony Marshall joined the Marines out of high school, during World War II. He was wounded leading a platoon at Iwo Jima.Marshall later served as ambassador in posts including Kenya, Madagascar and Trinidad and Tobago. He wrote seven books on topics ranging from African art to U.S. zoos, and he co-produced Tony Award-winning runs of ‘‘Long Day’s Journey Into Night’’ and ‘‘I Am My Own Wife.’’ He was married several times.‘‘Tony had the tenderest of hearts, a brilliant mind and an outrageous sense of humor,’’ his widow, Charlene, wrote in a death notice in The New York Times. She is not the mother of his twin sons, Philip and Alexander, and she stood staunchly by him during the criminal case.While Marshall said he and his mother were close, the trial depicted the relationship as difficult. His mother once told a friend, ‘‘I wish Tony had made something of himself instead of waiting for the money,’’ according to testimony.Marshall stepped aside as her guardian in 2006, after his son Philip filed court papers accusing him of neglecting her. Anthony Marshall denied any mistreatment.The family rift remained even after his death.‘‘The fact I first heard the sad news of my father’s death from the press speaks volumes about the devastating effect elder abuse can have on families,’’ Philip Marshall said.___
Boston police on Monday honored the two park rangers who were stabbed on Boston Common in October, as well as four civilians and five officers who came to their aid.Rangers Albert Hurd, 46, and James Lunnin, 25, were among the recipients of the Commissioner’s Commendation for bravery during their Oct. 14 confrontation with Bodio Hutchinson, who allegedly stabbed both men in front of stunned witnesses.\n\t\n“Thank God they’re recovering,” said Police Commissioner William B. Evans during a ceremony at the police district station downtown near Government Center. “They had some very serious injuries.”Both men said after the ceremony they hoped to return to work this winter and offered their thanks to the civilians and police officers who responded.“We’re very appreciative of all the individuals who helped us,” Hurd said.Lunnin said the aid the civilians offered to him and Hurd was unexpected. “Absolutely,” he said. “I was absolutely surprised.”The four civilians who were honored on Monday rendered first aid to the rangers before paramedics arrived and also provided information on the suspect’s whereabouts as he fled the scene, officials said.The civilians were Madison Sloan, Teal Fechtor-Pradines, Ducarmel Dorime, and Savanarnold Domond.Fechtor-Pradines, 16, of Watertown, told reporters he helped apply pressure to Hurd’s wounds after the stabbing and said he felt obligated to do so in the moment.“I did what any human being” would do, he said. “We’re all brothers and sisters.”Sloan, 20, of Roslindale, said he was pleased to learn that both rangers are expected to make a full recovery.“This is something I’m going to remember for probably a very long time,” he said.The Boston officers received commendations in part for their restraint when they apprehended Hutchinson — who shouted at police to shoot him — and for surrounding him in such a way that protected bystanders.They were Officers Kit Tong, Keith Tolland, Edward MacPherson, Paul Dok, and John Bates.Hutchinson, 34, who has a history of mental illness and violent outbursts, is slated to be arraigned Tuesday in Suffolk Superior Court on charges that include armed assault with intent to murder.He has been held on $1 million bail since his district court arraignment on the charges.
\n Fairmount commuter rail line is a bet that a train can revitalize neighborhoods that have been at Boston’s economic fringes for decades. The line, which runs from South Station to Dorchester, Mattapan, and Hyde Park, is lined with vacant lots and shuttered industrial properties. For years, these properties radiated blight. But since the Fairmount upgrades last year, they’ve become hot commodities. There’s no surer sign of the transformative power of transit investment than the sight of real estate developers fighting to get hold of an abandoned box warehouse in Uphams Corner, or a long-shuttered car dealership outside Mattapan Square.Luring developers with transit has become a familiar tactic in the area. In Somerville, a new Orange Line station has unlocked millions of square feet of new housing, storefronts, and office space, while the future arrival of the Green Line extension will enable a wide-scale redevelopment of the city’s Union Square neighborhood.\n\t\nBut the Green Line is only adding to what’s already a vibrant cultural and commercial center. The Fairmount, by comparison, is trying to create a development market where none exists, by connecting transit-starved neighborhoods to the downtown, and to the Newmarket industrial district.The line runs through neighborhoods that range from working-class to quite poor. The City of Boston owns the largest development parcels along the rail line. The properties fell into city hands because their former owners forfeited after deciding they weren’t even worth their taxes.The rail line itself remains a work in progress. A key station at Mattapan Square and Blue Hill Avenue is still in planning. Until new rapid-service cars arrive in 2020, the Fairmount will operate as a commuter rail line — an awkward fit for a short, Boston-only corridor. But even in its half-finished form, the Fairmount is working. The rail line has condensed some of the longest commutes in Boston. And it has turned vacant, weed-strewn, tax-foreclosed properties into hot commodities.The city-owned Maxwell Box and Cote Ford parcels are twin barometers of decline and resurgence along the Fairmount Line. The Maxwell property sits in Uphams Corner. The Cote site is an abandoned car dealership on Cummins Highway, outside Mattapan Square. They’re both long-vacant neighborhood eyesores, they both abut the Fairmount tracks, and they were both seized from delinquent owners. Each property is roughly three acres — big enough to be potential game-changers as development parcels, but also big enough to drag down their surrounding blocks in their current, derelict state.The sites were put out to bid last summer, and each has drawn multiple bids from developers. This level of competition would have been unheard-of even a few years ago. But the promise of rapid-transit service by the end of the decade has completely upended the development environment surrounding the parcels.Boston city officials are currently evaluating the bids. Most conform, broadly, to the visions community members outlined earlier this year: They contain mixed-income housing at a large scale, and contain some commercial space. On both properties, the city received bids from nonprofit neighborhood developers, and from a private developer seeking to build market-rate apartments. The bids by the private developer, Corcoran Jennison, show just how much the Fairmount Line has changed the neighborhoods it runs through. Corcoran is proposing to build hundreds of units of middle-income housing, without a public subsidy, on properties the development market wouldn’t touch, even a few years ago.If Boston is going to hit Mayor Marty Walsh’s housing targets — adding 53,000 new housing units, and driving Boston’s population to 700,000 people — the city is going to have to figure out how to move the needle on housing construction outside the Seaport and the downtown core. The developers now circling long-abandoned Fairmount Line properties show the formula isn’t all that complicated: When governments invest in transit, development will follow.
Once a year, every year of my elementary school life, a police officer from the local precinct would be a special guest at our assembly. Clad in his starched uniform, the officer – always white and male, in those days – would tell an auditorium filled with fidgety kids about all the good things cops do to make our communities safe. They were, we were told, our guardians, our bulwark against those who would do us harm.During the question-and-answer period, when some student inevitably would ask the officer whether he had ever used his gun to shoot someone, the cop would always say no. Then gently, but emphatically, he’d assert that the primary goal of the police department is to help people, not hurt them. Whether it was “Officer Mike” or “Officer Steve,” they were collectively known as “Officer Friendly,” and the overt message was always the same: a police officer is your buddy, your trusted ally in a time of need. \n\t\nIn America today, few African-American children likely view cops as their friends.Not after the death last July of , a 43-year-old unarmed black man and father of six, whose dying words, “I can’t breathe,” were ignored by Daniel Pantaleo, the New York City police officer who wrestled Garner to the ground in a maneuver banned more than two decades ago by the NYPD. The city’s medical examiner ruled Garner’s death a homicide caused, in part, by the cop’s illegal chokehold. (A New York grand jury will soon decide whether to bring charges against Pantaleo.)Not after the death less than a month later of , the unarmed black teen in Ferguson, Mo., who was shot multiple times by a police officer and left facedown and uncovered on a sweltering street for hours.
